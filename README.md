# drug-safety-narratives
This is a collection of 1139 narratives from the FDA Adverse Events Reporting System (*FAERS*). They were attained through Freedom Of Information Act (*FOIA*) requests to the FDA during the course of the *Drug Safety* project at i4Ds. The texts were parsed from PDF files. For some of them OCR had to be applied which is the reason for occasional artifacts.

While a lot of structured information about adverse event cases is freely available from FAERS (see [FAERS Quarterly Reports](http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Surveillance/ucm082193)), the narrative texts can only be accessed via FOIA requests. The aforementioned structured information describing these cases can be used as ground truth for supervised classification, e.g. to annotate adverse events and the corresponding drugs in a narrative.

The numbers used as filenames correspond to the FAERS case id.
