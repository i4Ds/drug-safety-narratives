AER 1458238, is a spontaneous case report received from an oncologist via other health care professional and 
Finnish Medicines Agency (Finland, reference number: FIFIMEA20141508) on 03/Sep/2014 and concerns a 66 
year old male patient who developed life threatening progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy and secondary 
grand mal epilepsy while being treated with rituximab (Mabthera).
Medical history included renal cell carcinoma (2005) and renal cell carcinoma was in remission.  Concurrent 
condition included CMV Pneumocystic carinii pneumonia: cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection (2010), opportunistic 
infection: CMV pulmonary infection (2010), two episode of mouth herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection (Apr/2014 
and May/2014) and pulmonary reaction. His immunodeficiency status was unknown and he had no chronic 
infections, HIV (human immune-deficiency virus), bone marrow transplant, solid bone transplant, herpes zoster or 
known CNS (central nervous system) pathology (CNS lupus or CNS lymphoma). Concomitant medications included
fludarabine phosphate, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, prednisone, bendamustine, chlorambucil, doxorubicin and 
aciclovir. No past drugs were reported.
On 20/Feb/2009, his antigens CD4 was 18%, 0,80 x 10 9 E/l and antigens CD8 was 57%, 2,55 x 10 9 E/l. On 
15/Sep/2009, the patient was diagnosed with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. On 22/Sep/2009, his immunoglobulin 
M was 0.48, unit not reported, and his immunoglobulin G was 11.87, Unit not reported. On 24/Sep/2009, he started 
the therapy with intravenous rituximab concentrate for solution for infusion 720 mg once every 3 weeks for chronic 
lymphocytic leukaemia. On 06/Nov/2009, the therapy with rituximab was stopped after completion of 3 cycles. On 
14/Nov/2013, his antigens, CD20 was positive. On 07/Jul/2014, his absolute neutrophil count was 2.22, unit not 
reported and white blood cell count was 5.5, unit not reported. On 16/Jul/2014, the therapy with rituximab (690 mg) 
was restarted (received only one cycle). Soon after the treatment (rituximab and fludarabine phosphate) was given, 
aphasia was observed and the patient spoke gibberish. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed changes in 
white matter with no clear radiology diagnosis. On 12/Aug/2014, his absolute neutrophil count was 2.96, unit not 
reported and white blood cell count was 6.3, unit not reported. Cerebrospinal fluid sample was taken, in which John 
Cunningham virus nucleic acid (JCV-Nh) titer was 7620 (unit and normal range not reported) and it indicated life 
threatening progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy on 13/Aug/2014 which caused significant disability. Later, 
he experienced secondary grand mal epilepsy. It was reported that, the brain biopsy was not performed. 
Mirtazapine was started and the patient was transferred to palliative care. It was reported that, the patient would die
from that complication. On 20/Aug/2014, his absolute neutrophil count was 5.11, unit not reported and white blood 
cell count was 8.9, unit not reported. It was reported that, he did not have stored serum sample available that was 
drawn within the previous 5 years of event onset.

FOIA Case Report Information
At the time of this report, the life threatening progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy was persisting and the 
outcome of secondary grand mal epilepsy was not reported. 
The oncologist did not report the causal relationship for life threatening progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy 
and secondary grand mal epilepsy with rituximab.
The company assessed the secondary grand mal epilepsy as medically significant.
This confirmed case of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) is being expedited per 
Roche/Genentech Enhanced Pharmacovigilance Plan for PML.
No further information was provided.
Additional information was received on 10/Sep/2014. Following information was added to this case: date of 
diagnosis of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, reporter details, medical history (renal cell carcinoma), concurrent 
conditions (CMV infection, CMV pulmonary infection, HSV infection and pulmonary reaction), other relevant medical
history (immunodeficiency status was unknown and he had no chronic infections, HIV, bone marrow transplant, 
solid bone transplant, herpes zoster or known CNS pathology), therapy details of rituximab, therapy details of 
concomitant medications (fludarabine phosphate, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, prednisone, bendamustine, 
chlorambucil and doxorubicin), new concomitant medication (aciclovir), new event (secondary grand mal epilepsy) 
with details and laboratory tests (antigens CD4, antigens CD8, immunoglobulin M, immunoglobulin G, absolute 
neutrophil count, antigens, CD20 and white blood cell count) was added. (Information was taken from the guided 
questionnaire).
