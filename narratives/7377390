No signiThis clinical trial cas  eqommmminimmmm concerns a 66-year-old male 
patient of other origin. The medical historyivas not re oncom re medications included: folic acid for 
anaemia,  - e    '*  - for nausea, potassium chloride as fluid/electrolyte therapy, oxycodone hydrochloride 
(trade: Oxycontin) and oxycodone for pain, simvastatin for lipidemia, enoxaparin as anticoagulant therapy and 
trietordwernicle for nausea. On 28-Aug-2009 the patient commenced pemetrexed 500 rrigim2 intravenously, 
actual dose 1000 mg, once every three weeks and cisplatin 75 mg/m2 intravenously, actual dose 150 mg, once 
every three weeks for treatment of cancer of lungs and liver metastases. The last dose of cisplatin administered 
prior to the event was on 13-Nov-2009 and for pemetrexed it was the 11-Dec-2009. Approximate' one month and 
one week after the last dose of cisplatin and 12 days since the last pemetrexed dose, on the patient 
was hospitalised due to upper abdominal pain (grade two), confusion (grade one) and tinnitus grade I. The patient 
also presented with symptoms of cough, phiegm and haernoptysis. Accidental fail was reported (not reported as 
SAE). A chest x-ray was performed on the which showed masses over the left upper zone and left 
hilum consistent with recent computerised tomography findings, there was a small right pleural effusion (symptom), 
but the lungs were otherwise essentially clear. The left lower pulmonary artery was almost completely occluded due 
to external a  ession by the tumour. The main left upper lobe bronchus also appeared to be compromised by 
the tumour and there were filling defects within segmental right lower lobe pulmonary arteries. Laboratory data on 
the. included: sodium 1311nrnol/L (reference range 133-145), potassium 3.2rnmol/L (reference range 
3.5-5. ), alanine aminotran.sferase (ALT) 55iu/L (reference range 0-50), albumin 25g/L (reference range 34-48g/L), 
globulins 45 g/L (reference range 25-41g/L), alkaline phosphatase 174iu/L (reference range 40-129iu/L). On 22-
Dec-2009 the following medications were given: oxycodone, beclomethasone, salbutamol, indapamide, senna 
atexandrina and lactulose. The investigator stated that pain analgesics had been increased due to the events. On 
23-00c-2009 dexamethasone given and it was reported that the patient recovered from the events the same day. 
kaboratory data on the included: white blood cells (WBC) 2.44x10E9/L (reference range 4.5-11), red 
1/1100.0 cells (RBC) 2.87x 1 reference range 4.5-6.5), hemoglobin (bb)8.3g/dl (reference range 13.5-18), 
hernatoc:rit 0.246 (reference Q.42-0.52), platelets 160x10E9/L (reference range 150-450.), neutophils 
1.78x10E9/1. (reference range 2.5-7.5), C-reactive protein (CRP) 207mg/L (reference range 04). On 
paracetamol was given. On oponin level was at <0.01 ug/L (normal 0 - 0.01). On the

recovered) and atrial fibrillation grade two, considered serious due to prolonged hospitalisation. Symptoms of right 
pleural effusion and chest pain were also reported. On a computerised tomography pulmonary 
angiogram (CTPA) was performed due to the facts that the patient had shortness of breath and right sided chest 
pain. The scan a^  4 . " e    that the patient had a right lower lobe pulmonary emboli. It was also reported that there   
were parenchymal changes which were not present on the previous computerised tomography scan of the 
11111111which were likely to represent infection. It was also re p o ed that on this date an electrocardiogram and chest 
x-ray were performed but no results were provided. 0 following laboratory values were re orted: 
sodium: 134, potassium: 3.6, urea: 4.6, creatinine: 68, bilirubin: 8 and alkaline phosphatase: 185. On

the event of pulmonary embolism was considered serious for prolonged hospitalisation. The patient experienced 
 of shortness of breath and another chest x-ray was performed on theill.11111. In the x-ray it was 
noted that there was patchy alveolar shado which might be due to infection, it was marginally worse in

pneumonia. It was not reported if any corrective treatment was given for these latter events, however concomitant 
enompatin given as anticoagulant. It was noted that the patient had reduced air entry with saturations (unspecified) 
of 71% whilst on air. It was queried if the patient had a pneumothorax. A chest x-ray was performed on the
