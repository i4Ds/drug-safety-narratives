AER 1602723 is a clinical study case, received on 01/Jul/2015 from a physician and concerns a 67 year old female 
patient who developed acute renal failure, pseudomembranous colitis, haemorrhagic cystitis, pneumonia, sepsis, 
pleural empyema and died due to progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy while enrolled in (b) (6)  
(b) (6)
Patient's medical history included arterial hypertension, herpes zoster right thigh, herpes zoster right thoracal, lower
lid basiloma surgery, disease progression of pre-existing cancer (CLL stage Binet C, Oct/2008) and disease 
progression of pre-existing cancer (CLL stage Binet B, May/2009). The patient's medical history was negative for 
chronic viral infection, HIV, bone marrow or solid bone transplant, opportunistic infections, cytomegalovirus (CMV) 
pneumocystic Carinii pneumonia and known central nervous system (CNS) pathology (CNS lupus or CNS 
lymphoma). Medical history of Herpes Simplex was unknown. Concurrent conditions included allergy to iodiferous 
contrast media and b-cell type chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Concomitant medications included pantoprazole 
sodium, metoprolol, amlodipine, olmesartan, spironolactone,hyperalimentation, dexamethasone and ondansetron. 
Chronic lymphocytic leukemia was diagnosed in /Jun/2009.
The patient had participated (b) (6)  study. On 07/Jul/2009 and on 08/Jul/2009, the patient received therapy with 
intravenous (IV) rituximab (375 mg/m2; once in 28 days) as first of 6 cycles of CLL10 study. On 09/Jul/2009 and 
10/Jul/2009, she received therapy with IV bendamustine (375 mg/m2; once in 28 days) as first of 6 cycles of CLL10
study as per the protocol. On 11/Aug/2009, she started therapy with IV rituximab (500 mg/m2; once in 28 days) and
IV bendamustine (70 mg/m2; once in 28 days) as 2-6 cycles of CLL10 study.  After 3 therapy cycles, staging 
showed partial hematological remission with complete remission of all lymphomas and splenomegaly, as well as an
normal blood count in /Sep/2009. In /Sep/2009, the patient developed a grade 3 thrombopenia (non-serious), in 
response to which bendamustine dose was reduced to 75%. On 01/Dec/2009, therapy with IV rituximab (500 
mg/m2) was stopped. On 02/Dec/2009, IV bendamustine (70 mg/m2) was discontinued. In /Sep/2010, staging by 
computer tomography showed complete remission and an inconspicuous spleen. On an unspecified date, the 
patient suffered from disease progression of pre-existing cancer with lymphocytosis and generalized 
lymphadenopathy (thrombocytes <100000/ul).  From /(b) (6)  until /(b) (6) , she was hospitalised due to right 
sided pneumonia with pleural empyema and sepsis (S. pneumoniae). The patient started unspecified antibiotic 
therapy and a partial resection of the pleura was performed. In (b) (6) , the right sided pneumonia with pleural 
empyema and sepsis resolved. On 22/Dec/2012, the patient suffered from recurrent vomiting without a feeling of 
indisposition. In Apr/2013, she developed a second episode of right sided pneumonia. In /Apr/2013, the second 
episode of right sided pneumonia resolved. In response to the disease progression, the patient was enrolled into 
(b) (6)  study. On 17/Dec/2013, the patient started therapy with IV rituximab (375 mg/m2; once in 28 days). On 
19/Dec/2013, therapy with IV bendamustine (70 mg; once in 28 days) and blinded oral ibrutinib was started. On

14/Jan/2014, rituximab was stopped. On 20/Feb/2014, therapy with IV rituximab (500 mg/m2) was started again. 
On 30/Mar/2014, patient was hospitalised for haemorrhagic cystitis until 03/Apr/2014 (event resolved). In Apr/2014, 
the patient developed atrial fibrillation (non-serious as per company) and started therapy with rivaroxaban (Xarelto). 
On 21/May/2014, rituximab was discontinued. On 22/May/2014, therapy with bendamustine ended. After 3 therapy 
cycles, staging and computer tomography revealed no lymphadenopathy, nearly normal blood count, and partial 
remission (lymph node parailiacal left) in Jun/2014. On 27/Oct/2014, therapy with ibrutinib was stopped. On 
18/Dec/2014, Patient had a self-inflicted car accident (non- serious). The car accident could not be reconstructed. 
Prior the car accident, the patient was disorientated. Since the car accident, patient showed an inadequate behavior
besides disorientation.He got nausea, vomited and felt confused. So she was admitted to the hospital where brain 
edema frontal was diagnosed. On 23/Dec/2014, rivaroxaban was stopped. On 30/Dec/2014, in response to pre-
existing atrial fibrillation, bradycardia tachykardia syndrome and intermittent asystole, the patient received a 
ventricular pacing and ventricular sensing pacemaker. On 04/Jan/2015, the patient started probatory therapy with 
dexamethasone (8mg, thrice daily) which was discontinued in response to lack of effect on 07/Jan/2015. On 
(b) (6)  the patient was hospitalised. In hospital, she showed no spontaneous or inducible motoric functions of
the upper extremities and legs. The patient's muscle tone was limply and the patient showed no Babinski signs on 
the right. Her upper arms showed no reactions on pain stimulus. The progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy 
was diagnosed by a cerebrospinal fluid analysis. No Brain MRI was performed prior to the event. No Brain MRI and 
no Brain Biopsy were performed at the ev net onset. A cranial computer tomography revealed progressive bifrontal 
hypodense regions and oedemas in the cerebellum. These results were compatible with a progressive multifocal 
leukoencephalopathy (PML). Additionally, pathological examination of the patient's cerebrospinal fluid showed a 
severe increase of JC viral load and no signs of tumor infiltration. JC Virus presence in liquor was tested. JC Virus 
level was extremely high. IgM, CD20, IgG, Ratio CD4:CD8, ANC and WBC were not examined at event onset. The 
patient did not store a serum sample that was drawn within the previous 5 years of event onset. Thoracal X-ray 
analysis (on (b) (6) ) and electroencephalography (on (b) (6)  and again on (b) (6) ) were 
performed without any relevant findings. It was reported that the patient started therapy with gemcitabine 
hydrochloride (Gemcitabin), tazobactam, piperacillin and sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim (Cotrimoxazol) which was 
discontinued after the diagnosis of PML. It was also reported that the patient developed a pseudomembranous 
colitis with clostridium difficile in stool and diarrhoea which led to an electrolyte derailment, dehydration, and in the 
end led to an acute renal failure. The patient was discharged on (b) (6)  On (b) (6)  the patient died due
to PML. It was reported that an autopsy was not performed.
At the time of death, acute renal failure, pseudomembranous colitis and atrial fibrillation were persisting.
The physician assessed the event of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy as related to therapy with 
rituximab during (b) (6)  study but did not report any causality to bendamustine, blinded ibrutinib. The physician did 
not provide a causality between the remainder events and therapy with rituximab, bendamustine, blinded ibrutinib.
