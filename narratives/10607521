Medically Significant
A neurologist reported that a female patient on TYSABRI (unknown dose, IV, QM) for relapsing remitting Multiple 
Sclerosis from Nov 2007 to 13 Aug 2014 was hospitalized from an unknown date to an unknown date for suspected
PML characterized by impaired vision, fatigue, and listlessness (onset Aug 2014). On 20 Aug 2014, MRI was highly 
suspect for PML with bi-frontal lesions. JCV Stratify test was positive (JCV antibodies). Current EDSS was 1.5.
Liquor (CSF) sample collection for JCV testing by (b) (6)  was done on 21 Aug 2014. Past MS therapy included 
Avonex (interferon beta-1a) and Rebif (interferon beta-1a). The event of suspected PML characterized by impaired 
vision, fatigue, and listlessness is ongoing. The causality for the event of suspected PML characterized by impaired 
vision, fatigue, and listlessness is unknown.  TYSABRI therapy was discontinued.

FOIA Case Report Information
Update 17 Oct 2014: A neurologist reported, via a Biogen Idec medical scientific liaison, that she had referred a 
female patient to the university hospital. The patient is again in her care and is currently in the IRIS phase.  No 
further information was provided.
Update 13 Nov 2014: Follow-up information received from Swissmedic who received information from a physician.
The case was considered serious due to hospitalization and disability.  The patient started TYSABRI (300 mg, IV, 
Q4W), for multiple sclerosis, in Nov 2007 and ended on 14 Aug 2014.  The causality of TYSABRI to the event of 
PML was assessed as "probable/likely."
The case narrative provided by Swissmedic reported: The 27-year-old patient received Tysabri (natalizumab) 300 
mg IV every 4 weeks for immunotherapy in multiple sclerosis since Nov-2007. First MS Diagnosis was in 2006.  In 
June 2014, the patient first noticed increased fatigue and listlessness. No other accompanying symptoms were 
apparent at this time, in particular, no motor or sensory loss or coordination problems. An external anamnesis 
indicated that the patient showed an aggressive and unrestraint behavior. Due to the fatigue, a cranial MRI was 
performed on 21 Aug 2014 (presume previously reported MRI on 20 Aug 2014). The diagnosis was a frontal 
leukencephalopathy matching a PML diagnosis. The positive JC virus result in the cerebrospinal fluid on the same 
day supported this diagnosis. The last TYSABRI administration was on 14 Aug 2014. There was no evidence of 
PML on the MRI of December 2013.  In the clinical neurological examination, the patient was well-oriented, showed
a prompt and consensual light reaction right < [less than] left. The pallaesthesia was bimalleolar 7/8. On 04 Sep 
2014 another MRI was performed which showed a progression of the plane T2 / FLAIR hyperintense signal of the 
frontal white matter with new manifestations in the white matter of the left frontal lobe. In the further course, a slight 
increase in the NMRI was visible, however still without contrast enhancement on the 17 Sep 2014. In the NMRI 
dated 03 Oct 2014 a contrast enhancement appeared frontal right, which was assessed to be a PML-Immune 
Reconstitution Inflammatory Syndrome (PML-IRIS).  During the period from 22 Aug 2014 to 01 Sep 2014, the 
treatment comprised 5x plasmapheresis and after exclusion of an infection, the patient received SoluMedrol 
(Methylprednisolone) 1g/d (03 Oct 2014 to 07 Oct 2014) followed by 50mg/d for 2 weeks.
Prior to the therapy with Natalizumab the patient had immunosuppressive therapy with Avonex (interferon beta-
1a) (Apr-2011   Jul-2011), and later with Rebif (interferon beta-1a) 3x44g/week in June and September 2011.
Other concomitant medications were Tenormin Submite (atenolol) 25mg 1/2 tablet twice daily and Cerazette 
(Desogestrel). For PML therapy Lariam (mefloquine) 250 mg/week, Keppra (levetiracetam) 2x250mg/d and 
Remeron (mirtazapine) 15mg for the night were newly prescribed.
In addition of multiple sclerosis with optic neuritis, the patient had a hypoplasia of the aortic arch which needed 
surgical intervention twice in the years 1987 and 1991. She smokes 1 pack of cigarettes/day (for 10 years). 
Allergies are not known.

FOIA Case Report Information
Currently, the patient is hospitalized. Further follow-up with MRI and EEG control is planned. According the 
prognosis for PML it is to be expected that she will have permanent sequela.
Update 20 Nov 2014: Biogen Idec considers this case to be a confirmed case of PML based on positive CSF, 
radiological evidence, and clinical symptoms.
Update 23 Dec 2014: Follow-up information was received from a physician, via the health authority. Prior therapy 
included Avonex (interferon beta-1a) from Apr 2007 to Jun 2007 and Rebif (interferon beta-1a) from Jun 2007 to 
Sep 2007.  The patient started TYSABRI in Nov 2007 and the last administration was on 14 Aug 2014.  The value 
of CSF DNA copies cannot be elucidated (NOS).
Update 15 Jan 2015: Follow-up information was received from a neurologist who requested shipment of liquor 
(CSF) sample, collected on 16 Jan 2015, to (b) (6)  for JC virus determination.
Update 18 Jun 2015: Additional information, received from the Regulatory Authority of Switzerland, SwissMedic, 
was generated in response to receipt of a MS PML Data Collection Form by the initial reporting neurologist, who 
then provided the information directly to SwissMedic; A physician sent a follow-up to the Health Authority stating 
that on 31 Oct 2014 the patient reported that her fatigue has improved overall a lot. Unchanged however was her 
way to be more impulsive as usual especially when food is concerned. The patient reported to be more irritable as 
usual, that she loses her patience quicker and that she has the need to talk a lot more. These assessments were 
confirmed by a third-party. There were no headaches or events suspicious for epilepsy. Since the start of the illness
the patient has gained 15 kilograms. A liquor (CSF) analysis at (b) (6)  from 22 Jan 2015 was negative while an 
internal JCV PCR turned out to be weak positive with a result of 20 copies/ml. The MRI results from 28 Apr 2015 
showed in comparison to the prior MRI dated from 25 Feb 2015 the known findings on both sides frontal, matching 
to the diagnosis of IRIS after PML, while on the right some locations were minimally more space-consuming 
respectively progredient. Likewise a slight increase of the small necrosis and the cystic areas was visible. The 
enhancements were constant in terms of the intensity and the spread. Apart from that unchanged MS lesion load 
without new lesions. The medical reviewer from the regulatory authority concluded that the assessment stayed 
unchanged and that they assessed the causality of PML and the treatment with TYSABRI according to the CIOMS 
criteria as probable.
