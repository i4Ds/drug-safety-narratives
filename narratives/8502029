pemetrexed 915 frig intravenously in combination with docetaxel 73 mg intravenously for treatment of sarcoma of 
lung. On the patient presented for cycle two, day oof study treatment complaining of hypoxia, grade 
3 over the past 2 that required continuous oxygen at 2 liters. On the same day, during routine pre- 
the cH rapy draws, the patient presented with an increased white blood cell count (WBC) of 11.7 (lab 
units and not reported). The patient took his last dose of steroid as part of his pre-chemo regimen. The

0 '0 0 0 tinged and with increased shortness of breath over the past week worsening from exertion to at rest The 
patient used home o and had noticed low oxygen (86 percent on room air and into the 60's) during the week. 
The patient had chills and night sweats. The patient was treated with moxifloxacin and o ,o0 ne hydrochloride 
(0 o.a tin) while in the emergency department (ED). Chest x-ray s a a focal opacity in the right lung base, the 
differential   Peet ' ch o versus pneumonia; interstitial lung disease Computerized to a ram

Mar-2012, approximately 2 days after the last dose of study therapy, the patient was admitted to the hospital for 
further of leukocytois possibly related to steriods and shortness of breath likely secondary to pneumonia. 
On admission, t tore was 36.6 to 36.8, pulse oximetty was 93 to 98 percent on 2 liters oxygen. White bl 0 0 0
