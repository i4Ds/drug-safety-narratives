This report was received from a registered nurse on 08JUL2013. 
A 3 year-old female initiated treatment with intravenous Soliris (eculizumab) for Atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome 
(aHUS). Soliris start date and dosing details were not provided. Soliris was temporarily withdrawn. 
The nurse reported that the patient was recently admitted to the hospital with a line sepsis (date not provided). The 
patient's catheter was fairly new and had recently been replaced and was put in the same location as the one that 
was removed. The nurse was not sure if that had to do with the sepsis. The patient was discharged from the 
hospital on-The Soliris infusions were on hold as per the patient's physician. The outcome was not 
provided. 
Medical history included aHUS. Concomitant medications were not provided. 
The reporting HCP did not provide a causality assessment for the reported event. 
Follow-up information was received on 13AUG2013 from a registered nurse (RN). 
The patient received a 600 mg Soliris infusion on 28May2013, and 300 mg infusions on 05JUN2013 and 
19JUN2013. The most recent infusion prior to the event was noted to be 300 mg on 19JUN2013. The most recent 
infusion at the time of this report was 01AUG2013 (dose was not provided). 
On 27JUN2013, after the third Soliris infusion, the patient experienced line sepsis. Treatment included a course of

(Kayexalate), sodium chloride 0.9%, albuterol sulfate and arnlodipine. 
The RN did not report the causal relationship of the event to So!iris therapy. 
No additional information was available at this time. 
Follow-up information was received on 10SEP2013 and 19SEP2013 from an RN. 
The most recent infusion was noted to be on 15AUG2013 (dose was not provided). 
The Broviac catheter infection resolved. Before Soliris therapy was resumed, the patient presented with a new line 
infection. Soliris continues to be withheld pending resolution of the recurrent line infection. The event was ongoing 
at the time of this report. 
No additional information was available at this time. 
Follow up information was received from a physician on 21 MAY2014 and from a consumer on 22MAY2014. 
The patient received last Soliris dose on 14MAY2014. 
It was reported that patient's C3 was consistently low which was less than 55 but lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) was 
ranging 218 to 230 over the last 6 months. The patient's haptoglobin was 50 in JAN2014 and platelets were 160000 
to 170000 base line. It was mentioned that the patients recent labs have showed signs of increased disease 
activity. It was mentioned that patient's platelets count was 133000. The patient's LDH was 297 and haptoglobin 
was less than 8 on 07MAY2014. It was also mentioned that patient had couple of colds on an unknown date. It was 
reported that patients hemoglobin (HGB) was decreasing. It was mentioned that patient was planned to have a 
kidney transplant and her labs are abnormal. Corrective treatment was unknown. At the time of report, Soliris 
therapy was ongoing. The events of C3 consistently low, lactate dehydrogenase was 297, haptoglobin was less 
than 8 and platelets were decreased were ongoing at the time of report. Outcome of the event of cold was 
recovered and outcome of the event of hemoglobin decreased was unknown. 
Additional medical history included hemodialysis, plasma exchange, plasma infusion, renal transplant, red blood 
cell (RBC) transfusion, patent ductus arteriosus (PDA), hypertension (HTN), hyperparathyroid, developmental delay

hypertension meds, epoetin alfa, paricalcitol and phosphate binders. The patients weight at the time of this report 
was 16 kg and 96.5 cm. 
The reporter did not assess the causality for the events of C3 consistently low, lactate dehydrogenase was 297, 
haptoglobin was less than 8, platelets decreased, cold and hemoglobin decreased to Soliris therapy. 
Follow up will be requested. 
Retrospective review of patient support program database following case report information was obtained on 
11SEP2013, 18SEP2013, 100CT2013, and 230CT2013 and subsequently received on 05JUN2014. 
On unreported dates, the patient was started on gentamicin and ciprofloxacin for the catheter infection. On 
06SEP2013. the old catheter was replaced. As of report date of 18SEP2013, she still had positive blood cultures 
and Soliris would not be restarted for at least another ten days. She received oral sulfamethoxazolettrimethaoprim 
for three weeks which concluded on an unspecified date in OCT2013. She was started on intravenous (IV) 
levofloxacin on an unreported date and it was continuing at the time of report on 100CT2013. Adjustments were 
made to her catheter in the hope that it would help stop the infections. She had missed multiple Soliris doses due to 
frequent central catheter infections. 
Follow up information was requested. 
Company comment 11SEP2013, 18SEP2013, 100CT2013, 2300T2013 and 05JUN2014.: Upon receipt of follow-
up information, this case remains a serious, medically confirmed and solicited report of device related sepsis 
(hospitalization). The event of device related sepsis is unlisted in the current CODS. Non serious event of 03 
consistently low, lactate dehydrogenase was 297, haptoglobin was less than 8. platelets decreased, cold and 
hemoglobin decreased were reported. Recurrence of line infection priorto resumption of Soliris makes the causal 
relationship between the event and Soliris unlikely. No change in prior assessments
