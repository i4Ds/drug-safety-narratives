AER 1431191 is a spontaneous case, received on 07/Jul/2014 from a consumer and concerns a female patient of 
an unspecified age who developed progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy while treated with rituximab 
(Rituxan).
Patient's medical history, concurrent conditions, concomitant medications or past drugs were not reported. 
On an unspecified date, the patient was diagnosed with chronic lymphocytic leukemia and participated in a clinical 
trial of the drug rituximab. On an unspecified date, she received intravenous rituximab infusion. The drug was made
by San Francisco-based Genentech, a member of the Roche group. It was on market since 1997. Rituximab can 
cause serious side effects that sometimes lead to death, the patient and her husband claimed in their (b) (6)
Petition for Leave to Take Pre-Complaint Deposition, in Superior Court. Progressive multifocal 
leukoencephalopathy (PML), a serious brain infection caused by a virus, is one such side effect listed in 
Genentech's prospectus for the drug, according to the petition. The infection damages nerves in the brain and 
spinal cord, leading to severe cognitive impairment, loss of voluntary movement, and eventually death. The patient 
reported that, she developed the infection and progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy which resulting in 
persistant or significant disability while participating in the trial. She and her husband claimed the (b) (6)
hospital that enrolled her in the trial, defendant (b) (6)  Medical Center, did not warn her that 
participants could develop PML, an untreatable condition. Her memory and comprehension were deteriorating 
rapidly, and her death was imminent, according to the petition. The patient planned to sue the hospital and two 
oncologists for medical and research malpractice, assault and battery, lack of informed consent, fiduciary duty, and 
fraud/ intentional misrepresentation. They will also bring product liability and negligence claims against Genentech 
and the review board that approved the clinical trial, according to the petition. The couple asked the court to 
expedite the patient's deposition, claiming her condition, including her ability to understand and answer questions, 
was rapidly deteriorating. They said that, the patient may be the only source of information about her knowledge of 
the risks and her injuries.
At the time of this report, it was not known whether the therapy with rituximab was ongoing. 
The reporter assessed causal relationship of the event progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy as related to 
rituximab.
No further information was provided.
Follow up information was received on 16/Jul/2014 (medical records). Following information was added to the case:
