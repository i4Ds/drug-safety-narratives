Medically Significant
The below information is a case summary from 04 Jul 2014 to 15 Jun 2015:
A 37 year old Italian male patient on Tysabri for MS x 52 infusions from 2010 to May 2014 and enrolled in the 
(b) (6) ) study. The patient s MS was diagnosed in 2007. He is anti-
JCV Ab positive (Feb 2014; index 3.32) and has no IS history. He was previously on AVONEX from Oct 2008 to 
Dec 2009. 
Starting in the beginning of Apr 2014, the patient reported balance worsening and decrease of strength of lower 
limbs that affected walking autonomy. The patient, who was able to walk 500 meters without any aid before, 
became able to walk only 20 meters with an aid. He went to the emergency room and underwent a neurological 
examination on 12 Apr 2014 which showed no evident deficits of memory functions, nystagmus with rotational 
horizontal component, also present in the primary position of gaze, leading to oscillopsia, mild dysarthria, mild 
monoparesis of the left upper limbs, with associated disturbances of motor coordination. Paraparesis (L>R), 
urgency of mict., hypopallestesia at all limbs, EDSS 5.5/6. He underwent a brain MRI with contrast medium 
administration to exclude PML on 12 Apr 2014 which no significant changes were observed in the multiple and 
already known demyelinating lesions in the supratentorial and subtentorial white matter, in particular there's no 
evidence of the occurrence of new lesions when compared to the previous one performed on 19-Sep-2013 at 
another health structure. After contrast medium administration, no pathological enhancement areas were observed.
The size of the ventricular system was comparable to the previous exam and the other findings resulted 
unchanged. Given the recent clinical worsening, the patient was admitted to the hospital from (b) (6)  to (b)(6)  
(b) (6)
During hospitalization the patient received IV methylprednisolone 1 g x 5 days, since there was a suspicion of MS 
relapse which was radiologically not observable, and this therapy brought a subjective benefit. At discharge, a mild 
balance improvement was observed both in static and dynamic phase. On 18 Apr 2014 the patient underwent his 
51st TYSABRI infusion, and the patient returned to disease stability following discharge. The patient didnt undergo
any other MRI or visits (during the previous hospitalization it was suggested the patient undergo a medullary and 
cervical rachis MRI with contrast medium, that was not performed). On 20 May 2014 the patient received his 52nd 
TYSABRI infusion. 
On (b) (6)  the patient was hospitalized. During hospitalization he underwent: electrocardiography (81 bpm, 
the pattern resulted regular); hematochemical tests which were normal, psychodiagnostic assessment (the 
reflections reached after the interview are compatible with the patient s difficulty in adapting to the current clinical 
situation. After the psychological path the patient showed an adequate self-reflection, a good ability to analyze and

to autonomously explore all those starting points that arose from the interview. For such reason, considering the 
patient s strong introspective skills, the psychological interviews are strongly recommended, even after the patient 
has returned to his home), neuropsychological, othorinolaringoiatry visit, and neurophtalmological visit.
Neurological exam at discharge: the objective examination was unchanged compared to the hospitalization time. 
EDSS score was 6.0 (P3, C3, TE2, S0, Sf1, V1, M1). Reached results: a mild improvement of the oscillopsia.
Increase of the global sthenia and of the resistance during the walk, which is possible, at the discharge, with aid for 
medium-long paths. Moreover mild balance improvement was observed, both in static and dynamic phase. 
Malnutrition universal screening tool (MUST) was 0, so low risk level of malnutrition. Barthel index was 85, FIM 
(Functional Independence Measure) was 110 and Berg was 41. 
Since the patient didn t have any benefit from previous steroid therapy or from the fisiokinetic therapy (after being 
in rehab for the past month), on (b) (6)  he underwent an emergency MRI with contrast medium administration 
which, compared to the previous one performed on in Feb 2014, the current exam showed presence of multiple 
hyperintense foci in the long TR sequences, both supratentorial and subtentorial, ascribable to demyelinating 
lesions, was confirmed. Several lesions in the cerebellar hemispheric bilateral area and in the pontine and bulbar 
area bilaterally, along with a concomitant cerebellar atrophy progression, without any enhancing lesions. Such rapid
progression of the lesions in the posterior fossa was assessed as being worth a new clinical neurological 
assessment so that other causes of the new lesions' occurrence could be ruled out. After contrast medium 
administration no enhancing lesions suggesting "active phase" were observed. The ventricular system resulted 
unchanged in size as well as the cortical sulci. The patient was again hospitalized in order to be treated on (b) (6)  
(b) (6)
During hospitalization the patient underwent the following testing: neurologic visit upon admission showed the 
patient was alert, oriented and cooperative. A LP was performed on (b) (6)  and CSF analysis was clear, 
uncolored, glucose: 55 mg/dl, protein: 40 mg/dl, cells 3, positive for JCV DNA presence: 657 copies/ml (initially 
reported as 2000 copies/mL), negative for cultures, the oligoclonal bands research resulted positive for intratecal 
synthesis, urine exam was positive for JCV presence 8014 copies/ml. So the PML diagnosis was formulated. 
The neuroradiological picture was atypical, featured by cerebellar atrophy and suggested a kind of PML involving 
the granule cells. Considering that the last TYSABRI infusion was administered 6 weeks earlier and there were 
signs of initial IRIS (CD4/C8 ratio was regular) the neurologist decided to perform just two PLEX cycles, which 
occurred from(b) (6)  to (b) (6)  and was well tolerated. Mefloquine therapy was administered (250 
mg/day for three days, then 250 mg/week) as well as mirtazapine 30 mg/day. On (b) (6)  the patient underwent
a follow up brain MRI with contrast medium, which showed the following: compared to the previous exam 
performed on 12 Apr 2014 new T2 and FLAIR hyperintensities were observed in the bulbus, anteriorly in the right 
parasagittal area, in the middle cerebellar peduncles, especially on the right and on both cerebellar hemispheres.

The multiple punctiform signal hyperintensities in the pons and in the pons-mesencephalic segment resulted mainly
increased. The global parenchymal subtentorial atrophy maybe was also relatively increased. The supratentorial 
picture was stable without any new alteration. No visible lesions, featured by restricted diffusion, were found. Some 
doubtful and small enhancing foci were found after contrast medium administration in both the cerebellar 
hemispheres in which the artifact influence cannot be definitely excluded. The picture worsened compared to the 
previous one observed in Apr 2014. Considering the neuroradiological picture on (b) (6)  IV Solumedrol 
(methylprednisolone) 500 mg was administered. Clinical conditions were stable during hospitalization and on (b) (6)  
(b) (6) the patient was moved to the neuro-rehabilitation department of the hospital in order to start motor fisiokinetic 
therapy and to continue receiving treatments. At the time of this report, the patient was hospitalized at the 
rehabilitation center and undergoing daily sessions of rehabilitative neuromotor physiotherapy. On 23 Jul 2014 
maraviroc therapy was started (300 mg x2/day).
Upon internal review, Biogen Idec considers this case confirmed for PML on 10 Jul 2014 based on clinical 
symptoms, positive CSF, and radiologic evidence.
Update 21 Aug 2014:  The following information was received from the National Pharmacovigilance Network 
(registry number unknown).  Maviroc therapy (presume maraviroc) was discontinued for two days (03 Aug 2014 to 
05 Aug 2014) due to a headache caused by the drug itself.  On 29 Jul 2014 the patient experienced worsening of 
cerebellar dysarthria and ataxia.  An MRI from 29 Jul 2014 showed further extension of the increase in size of all 
known T2 and FLAIR hyperintense lesions in the pons region, pontine-mesencephalic region, and middle cerebellar
peduncles, especially on the right in both cerebellar hemispheres.  The supratentorial "picture" was stable.  There 
were small enhancing foci on both the cerebellar hemispheres and in the brain stem resulted observable and more 
visible on late phase.  Treatment included methylprednisolone for 5 days.  On 02 Aug 2014 the patient developed a 
fever (Tmax of 38.4 degrees Celsius on unknown date) that was associated with an increase in inflammatory organ
damage markers (NOS).  On 15 Aug 2014 the patient experienced further worsening characterized by dysphagia 
and worsening dysarthria.  An MRI from 16 Aug 2014 showed known PML with higher pathological involvement in 
the brain stem, especially of the pontine-mesencephalic region, where hyperintense signal alteration in long TR 
resulted increased in number and size , with a strongly confluent aspect; in the same way a higher extension of the 
T2 hyperintense and FLAIR signal alteration was observed involving the middle cerebella peduncles and the white 
matter of both the cerebella hemispheres. In the images acquired after contrast medium administration, although 
some movement artifacts, a strong regression of the pathological enhancement in the brainstem and in the 
previously described bilateral cerebellar hemisphere was observed, along with the persistence of some punctiform 
enhancing areas in the right anterior-lateral bulbar region, in the central-pontine and in the bilateral deep cerebellar 
hemispheric area, more consistent on the right. No significant changes of the supratentorial neuro-radiologic picture
were observed.

Pharmacovigilance Network - Regional Centre, registry # not provided), states that the relationship between the 
event (presume reference to event of PML) and TYSABRI, evaluated through Naranjo algorithm, is probable. No 
further information was provided.
Update 20 Oct 2014: Additional information was received from the neurologist via a MS Standardized PML Data 
Collection Tool. The patient s estimated Karnofsky and EDSS scores were: 70 and 4.0 in Apr 2010; 60 and 6.0 on 
12 Apr 2014; 50 and 6.5 on 02 Jul 2014. The patient tested HIV negative on an unspecified date. The patient tested
positive for anti-JCV antibodies in Nov 2011 and Feb 2014. An MRI from 03 Feb 2014 was unchanged compared to
prior exams. The patient had lumbar punctures (LP) on 03 Jul 2014 and 01 Sep 2014 and both CSF JCV PCR 
results returned positive at 657 (previously reported as 2000) and 6300 copies/mL, respectively. Results are 
pending for a LP performed on 17 Oct 2014. The patient was diagnosed with IRIS, which was determined by clinical
symptoms and MRI findings. Clinical symptoms included sleeping inferior limbs, balance and dysarthria, and 
speech symptoms (onset 16 Aug 2014). The patient received corticosteroids pre- and post-IRIS onset. Treatment 
for IRIS icluded the following tapering schedule: Solumedrol 1 GM IV daily from 12 Aug to 16 Aug 2014 to 500 mg 
IV daily x 2 days to 125 mg IV daily x 2 days (stopped 20 Aug 2014) then oral Deltacortene 50 mg daily started 21 
Aug 2014; Solumedrol 500 mg IV for two days, stopped 27 Aug 2014. Currently, the patient is alive and is in a 
rehabilitation facility. The patient has not recovered from PML or IRIS. Causality for the events was assessed as 
related to TYSABRI.
Update 12 Feb 2015: Additional information was received from a physician via a MS Standardized PML Data 
Collection Tool. The patient is alive, residing at home, and is on Copaxone (glatiramer acetate) for preventative MS 
therapy. The physician assessed the patient's estimated Karnofsky and EDSS scores on 04 Feb 2015 to be 50 
(requires considerable assistance and frequent medical care) and 8, respectively. A brain MRI was performed on 
28 Jan 2015, which showed a minimal improvement in the size of the brainstem and cerebellar T2 lesions. 
Progression of the vermian atrophy was observed. No areas of diffusivity restriction on DWI were observed, and no 
gadolinium enhancing lesions apparent. Test results from 29 Oct 2014 (post-PML) were reported: leukocyte count 
4.9 x 10(9)/L (normal range 4.8 to 10.8 x 10(9)/L) and absolute lymphocyte count 0.9 x 10(9)/L (normal range 1 to 
4.8 x 10(9)/L). IRIS was diagnosed by clinical symptoms and MRI findings. Clinical symptoms of IRIS included 
worsening of cerebellar dysarthria (speech; onset date 15 Jul 2015 - presume 2014) and worsening of cerebellar 
ataxia of the trunk and limbs (cerebellar; onset 15 Jul 2015 - presume 2014). The patient did not receive 
corticosteroids pre-IRIS (discrepant from previous report). Treatment for IRIS included the following: 
methylprednisolone 1 GM IV daily from 15 Jul 2014 to 19 Jul 2014; methylprednisolone 1 GM IV daily from 12 Aug 
2014 to 20 Aug 2014; prednisolone 1 mg/kg by mouth daily from 20 Aug 2014 to 23 Aug 2014; methylprednisolone 
1 GM IV daily from 27 Aug 2014 to 28 Aug 2014; prednisolone 0.5 mg/kg by mouth daily from 29 Aug 2014 to 30 
Aug 2014; prednisolone 0.3 mg/kg by mouth daily from 31 Aug 2014 to 02 Oct 2014 (discrepant from previous 
report). As of 02 Dec 2014, the outcome of the event PML was "recovered with big sequelae."  The event of IRIS

was considered to be recovered with sequelae as of 27 Nov 2014. Causality for the events was assessed as 
related to TYSABRI.
Update 15 Jun 2015: A report was received via a literature abstract. Dalla Costa G, Moiola, L, Pavan G, Sangalli F, 
De Riz MA, Gerevini S; Mancini N, Comi G, Martinelli V. Cerebellar granule cell neuronopathy in a natalizumab-
treated MS patient: The dark side of JC virus infection. 1st Congress of the European Academy of Neurology 
(EAN); Berlin; Germany. A 37 year old female with MS for 7 years started natalizumab due to inefficacy of IFN-beta 
(see Avonex case 2015BI086605). The patient was treated with a 5 day course of IV steroids and physiotherapy for
severe gait ataxia suspected to be a [MS] relapse. After 3 months and 2 additional natalizumab infusions, MRI 
showed marked cerebellar atrophy and JCV was found in CSF confirming the diagnosis of JCV granule cell 
neuronopathy. Natalizumab was discontinued and the patient underwent plasma exchange but the patient 
experienced a worsening of clinical symptoms. MRI indicated PML lesions in brainstem and contrast enhancement 
in the cerebellum (IRIS). Treatment included steroids. IRIS resolved and the patient did not deteriorate further. The 
outcome of the event, JCV granule cell neuronopathy, was not reported; causality was assessed as related to 
natalizumab. The authors concluded that although PML is the most common presentation of JCV, atypical 
manifestations such as progressive cerebellar atrophy should be considered and natalizumab treatment stopped in 
any case of doubt.
