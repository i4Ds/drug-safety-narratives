Medically Significant
A neurologist spontaneously reported that a female patient on TYSABRI (300 mg, IV, QM) for Multiple Sclerosis 
from unknown date to unknown date experienced suspected PML (onset Jun 2014). Treatment for the event was 
not reported. A liquor sampling was planned. The event of suspected PML is ongoing. The causality for the event of
suspected PML is unknown.  It is unknown if TYSABRI treatment is ongoing.
Update 19 Jun 2014: Additional information was received from the neurologist via a Biogen Idec employee (Medical
Scientific Liaison). The 50 year old patient on TYSABRI (300 mg, IV, QM) for Multiple Sclerosis from 25 Oct 2006 
experienced her first MS symptoms in Aug 2003 and was diagnosed with MS in Feb 2004. The patient's clinical 
symptoms included progressive paresis of the right leg. A MRI on 16 Jun 2014 showed new, non-enhancing lesion 
frontal lobe. The patient's liquor sampling was scheduled on 23 Jun 2014. No additional information was reported.

Update 24 Jun 2014: Additional information was received from the neurologist. The patient's liquor sampling was 
done on 23 Jun 2014 and sent to (b) (6)  for CSF JCV determination. An additional JCV [DNA] test at a university 
hospital was positive on an unknown date. The neurologist stated that for her, the event PML was confirmed. No 
further information was provided.
Update 08 Jul 2014: Additional information was received from the neurologist via a MS PML Data Collection Form: 
Suspect.  The patient on TYSABRI from 25 Oct 2006 to 26 May 2014 was diagnosed with PML on(b) (6)  and
hospitalized from (b) (6)  to (b) (6)   The patient was residing at home prior to and after the 
hospitalization. The patient was diagnosed with MS on 13 Feb 2004.  MS disease symptoms prior to PML diagnosis
included pyramidal syndrome with left accentuated tendon reflexes and extensor plantar response on the left (onset
unknown).  The patient has never received prior immunosuppressant therapy; however, immunomodulatory therapy
included Avonex IM QW for MS from 19 Apr 2004 to 01 Oct 2006. Signs and symptoms which lead to the 
evaluation for possible PML included progressive paresis in the right leg (onset Apr 2014).  A MRI at the time of 
PML diagnosis was performed on 16 Jun 2014 and a MRI prior to PML diagnosis was performed on 23 Sep 2013; 
images will be provided as soon as available (results of MRI on 16 Jun 2014 was previously reported).  A lumbar 
puncture was performed on an unknown date and CSF sample was tested on 23 Jun 2014; CSF JCV DNA results 
were positive at (b) (6)  (336 copies/ml) and a local lab (3571 GEq/ml). CSF analysis (cell count, protein, glucose, 
albumin) 23 Jun 2014 was normal.  No brain biopsy has been done. The patient tested positive for serum anti-JCV 
antibody on 09 May 2011 (titer not provided), 13 Jan 2014 (titer = 1.96), and 23 Jun 2014 (titer not provided).  CBC 
pre-TYSABRI on 05 May 2006 and CBC pre-PLEX on 23 Jun 2014 were normal.  CD4 pre-TYSABRI was not done 
and CD4 pre-PLEX on 23 Jun 2014 was 0.73G/l (normal range 0.6-1.6 G/l).  Treatment for PML included 5 
sessions of PLEX on 25 Jun 2014, 27 Jun 2014, 30 Jun 2014, 03 Jul 2014, and 04 Jul 2014 and mirtazapine15mg 
QD since 25 Jun 2014. The event of PML is ongoing. The causality of the event PML in relation to TYSABRI was 
assessed as related.   TYSABRI therapy was stopped on 26 May 2014.
Update 10 Jul 2014: Upon internal review, this case has been confirmed for PML based on positive MRI and CSF 
and clinical symptoms.
Update 13 Oct 2014: Additional information was received from the neurologist via a MS Standardized PML Data 
Collection Tool. At the time of PML diagnosis, the patient's height was 166 cm and weight was 63 kg. The patient s
estimated Karnofsky scores were assessed as follows: score of 90 (able to carry on normal activity; minor signs or 
symptoms of disease) on 25 Oct 2006 and on 26 Aug 2013; score of 70 (cares for self; unable to carry on normal 
activity or to do active work) on 23 Jun 2014. EDSS scores were assessed as follows: score of 1.5 prior to 
TYSABRI (date unspecified); score of 1.5 on TYSABRI prior to PML (date unspecified); and score of 3.0 on 23 Jun 
2014. The patient tested negative for anti-natalizumab antibodies on 22 Dec 2008, and tested negative for HIV on 
23 Jun 2014. The patient has been diagnosed with IRIS, determined by MRI findings and clinical symptoms (focal

motor; progression of paresis in right leg). The patient did not receive corticosteroids prior to onset of IRIS. 
Treatment for IRIS was as follows: SoluMedrol (methylprednisolone sodium succinate) 1 GM IV daily from 01 Sep 
to 05 Sep 2014; Medrol (methylprednisolone) 100 mg PO daily from 06 Sep to 08 Sep 2014; Medrol 50 mg PO daily
from 09 Sep to 11 Sep 2014; and Medrol 32 mg PO daily from 12 Sep to 14 Sep 2014. Medrol 500 mg PO daily 
was also administered on the following dates: from 24 Sep to 26 Sep 2014, 01 Oct to 03 Oct 2014, and 11 Oct to 
13 Oct 2014. Currently, the patient is alive and is residing in a rehabilitation facility. No additional lumbar punctures 
have been performed. The patient has not recovered from PML and has not recovered from IRIS. Causality for the 
events was assessed as related to TYSABRI.
