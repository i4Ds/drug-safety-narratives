The patient's weight was 32.9 kilograms and height was 141 centimeters. The patient's concurrent condition 
included acute myeloid leukemia (AML) recurrent beginning on 06-OCT-2015 (post-transplant studies showed 5% 
blasts) and medical history included AML between 07-JUN-2011 and OCT-2013 (pre-B white blood cells (WBC) 
60000, coagulase-negative Staphylococcus (CNS) negative, treated on high risk protocol (b) (6)  completed

plus umbilical cord transplant on (b) (6)  which was donated from a matched sibling), also had grade 1 
anemia and grade 1 platelet count decreased prior to start of treatment. 
The patient was treated with non-company suspect drug propofol (unspecified, unspecified) 100 mg as necessary 
at 13:05, 250 ug/kg/min 13:06, 275 ug/kg/min at 13:31, 20 mg at 13:45, 10 mg at 13:47, 200 ug/kg/min at 14:04 
and stopped at 14:13 administered for anesthesia. The patient was pre-medicated for gemtuzumab ozogamicin 
with paracetamol at 480 mg every 6 hours for moderate pain, methylprednisolone sodium succinate and 
hydroxyzine hydrochloride. 
The patient was treated with company suspect decitabine (lyophilized powder, intravenous) 22.8 mg a cyclical, 
(every 24 hours for 5 doses), initiated on 23-OCT-2015, along with gemtuzumab ozogamicin (injection, intravenous

23:42. The patient also received another dose of paracetamol 498 mg liquid, oral once at 23:42. Blood cultures 
were drawn (central line and peripheral, no growth was seen to date), and she was started on empiric antibiotics. 
The patient received Vancocin (vancomycin) for fever 500 mg intravenous piggyback (IVPB) mini-bag intravenous 
every 6 hours and Fortaz (ceftazidime) for febrile neutropenia 2 g IVPB mini-bag intravenous every 8 hours. The 
patient was diagnosed with grade 1 fever requiring patient's hospitalization/prolongation of hospitalization. The 
patient was treated with another company drug DIFLUCAN (fluconazole) (film coated tablet, oral) 200 mg a day, 
initiated on 28-OCT-2015 for antifungal prophylaxis. The vancomycin was administered till 28-OCT-2015 and 
ceftazidime till 29-OCT-2015. 
The patient recovered completely from grade 1 fever on (b) (6)  The patient was discharged on the same 
(b) (6)  after the hospitalization, when blood cultures showed no growth to date. 
The patient experienced grade 4 neutrophil count decrease on the same day when complete blood count (CBC) 
revealed absolute neutrophil count (ANC) of 0.3 x 10e3/mm3 (NR: 1.0 - 9.0 x 10e3/mm3). 
On 30-OCT-2015, the ANC was 0.5 x 10e3/mm3 (grade 3 neutrophil count decreased). On the same day, the 
patient experienced grade 1 alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level increased with ALT of 38 U/L (NR: 0-34 U/L).
On 02-NOV-2015, at clinic visit, comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP) revealed ALT level of 26 U/L. The grade 3 
neutrophil count decreased continued (neutrophil count was 0.1 x 10e3/mm3), which lead to grade 4 neutrophil 
count decreased. A clinic visit on same day revealed grade 2 platelet count decrease with platelet count of 54 x 
10e3/mm3 (NR: 165 - 335 x10e3/mm3). 
On (b) (6)  the platelet count was 40 x 10e3/mm3 (grade 3 platelet count decrease). The patient 
experienced grade 3 febrile neutropenia which required hospitalization /prolongation of hospitalization. She was 
treated with another non-company suspect drug immunoglobulin human normal (injection, intravenous NOS) 
unspecified dose and frequency initiated on 04-NOV-2015 for decreased immunoglobulin G (IGG). She took 
acetaminophen IVIG 480 mg liquid oral once-prior to IVIG and aydroxyzine for IVIG 20 mg tablet oral once-prior to 
IVIG for pre-medication. At clinic visit, the ANC was 0. The patient that evening had a temperature of 101.7 
Fahrenheit at home and was presented to emergency department (ED). 
On (b) (6)  the patient had also experienced grade 1 rectal pain. The physical examination of perirectal area
was notable for being reddish, but no point tenderness. The physical examinations were not consistent with a 
perirectal abscess. The patient started on zinc oxide 40 % ointment topical two times daily as necessary. On the 
same day, she was febrile to 40.9 C in ED, ANC equal to 0, blood cultures were obtained (central line and 
peripheral), and was started on ceftazidime intravenous for febrile neutropenia at 1000 mg IVBP (intravenous Mini

bag) every 8 hours, and at a dose of 1600 mg IVBP, intravenous every 8 hours. The drug was ongoing as of the 
report. The patient was admitted to hospital for further monitoring and continued antibiotic therapy in setting off 
fever and neutropenia.
 On (b) (6)  the patient experienced grade 2 anemia, hemoglobin was 8 g/dL (NR: 11.2 - 14.8 g/dL). She 
had received red blood cell transfusion of 310 mL in total volume. The patient also received paracetamol tablet, oral
325 mg once for fever, ondansetron hydrochloride injection, intravenous 2 mg every 6 hours, as needed for nausea
or vomiting on 06-NOV-2015 and 07-NOV-2015. The ondansetron hydrochloride intravenous 4 mg was 
administered every 6hours as necessary from 07-NOV-2015.
 On 09-NOV-2015, she experienced grade 1 constipation and was treated with Colace (docusate sodium) capsule, 
oral 50mg daily. Treatment for the patient ended with a bone marrow biopsy that determined that the treatment was
unsuccessful, and gemtuzumab ozogamicin did not work. The patient received propofol 1 mg/kg injection every 1 
min as necessary, total dose of 100 mg and was treated with company suspect SUBLIMAZE (fentanyl) (injection, 
intravenous NOS) 15 ug a as necessary, (once per 1 min, received total dose of 30 ug), administered on 09-NOV-
2015 for sedation. During procedural sedation, the patient experienced grade 3 hypotension, mild drop to 60/20s 
and required a fluid bolus. The patient received 310 mL of sodium chloride 0.9%. After the procedure patient was 
awake, alert and talking. She recovered on the same date from grade 3 hypotension. The ondansetron 
hydrochloride 4 mg was administered till 10-NOV-2015. She had a bowel movement on 10-NOV-2015. The patient 
was changed to Senna-plus (senna-docusate) 8.5-50mg tablet once nightly. The treatment with zinc oxide was 
stopped on the same day and the patient had recovered from rectal pain on the same day. The grade 3 platelet 
count decreased (52 x 10e3/mm3) continued until (b) (6)  which resulted in grade 2 platelet count. Blood 
cultures showed no growth, and the patient received ceftazidime until 12-NOV-2015. She was afebrile for a period 
of 8 days (since admission). The patient had recovered completely from the event febrile neutropenia and grade 1 
constipation on (b) (6)  and was discharged. 
At clinic visit on 16-NOV-2015, the patient reported grade 1 bone pain in her upper thighs. Also, the platelet count 
was 121 x 10e3/mm3, the patient showed grade 1 platelet count decreased and the hemoglobin was 11.4g/dL. The
patient did not require any platelet transfusions, no additional treatment given. The patient had recovered from 
platelet count decreased, grade 2 anemia on the same day and the patient was recovering from grade 4 neutrophil 
count decreased.
 On 20-NOV-2015, the ANC was 0.8 x 10e3/mm3 (grade 3 neutrophil count decreased-30 days after the last dose 
of gemtuzumab ozogamicin). On 20-NOV-2015, the patient was started on oral palliative chemotherapy. 
At clinic visit on 23-NOV-2015, the ANC was 0.9 x 10e3/mm3 (grade 3neutrophil count decreased) and the bone

pain resolved. 
The dose of fluconazole, fentanyl and propofol was not changed and action taken with decitabine, gemtuzumab 
ozogamicin and immunoglobulin human normal was not applicable. 
The patient was recovering from neutrophil count decreased and had recovered from grade 1 fever, grade 1 
alanine aminotransferase increased, hypotension grade 3, grade 1 rectal pain, grade 3 febrile neutropenia, grade 1 
constipation, platelet count decreased, grade 2 anemia and grade 1 bone pain. 
The investigator considered grade 3 febrile neutropenia related but specified as unlikely attributed to gemtuzumab 
ozogamicin, and possibly attributed to decitabine and to immunoglobulin human normal. The investigator 
considered there was a reasonable possibility that event grade 1 fever after infusion, grade 1 bone pain, grade 1 
constipation, grade 2 anemia, grade 1 alanine aminotransferase increased, platelet count decreased, neutrophil 
count decreased and grade 1 rectal pain was related to gemtuzumab ozogamicin. The investigator assessed there 
was a possible attribution for the adverse event alanine aminotransferase increased to fluconazole and decitabine. 
The investigator also assessed  grade 1 constipation, grade 1 and grade 2 anemia, platelet count decreased, 
neutrophil count decreased, grade 1 bone pain, grade 1 rectal pain as possibly attributed to decitabine. Intravenous 
immune globulin was considered possibly attributed to anemia, neutrophil count decreased and platelet count 
decreased.
The investigator considered there was not a reasonable possibility that the event grade 3 hypotension was related 
to gemtuzumab ozogamicin, and definite attributed the event to sedation medications propofol, and fentanyl. 
This report was serious (hospitalization, medically significant).
Otsuka assessment: Pediatric patient developed the events nine days after first cycle of decitabine and recovered 
with treatment. The causal relationship between the events and decitabine therapy was considered as possible due 
to positive temporal relationship, however, cosuspect medications, previous transplant treatment and underlying 
AML with myelosupression also may be a contributory.
Otsuka does not consider the information contained in this Individual Case Safety Report to justify any change to 
the benefit-risk balance of decitabine, fluconazole, fentanyl, gemtuzumab ozogamicin, propofol and immunoglobulin
human normal or to justify any safety measures.
