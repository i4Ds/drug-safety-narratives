Case number PHHY2015US170641 is an initial report received on 02 Dec 2014 report from an investigator and 
forwarded by a pharmaceutical company (MCN No: DEP_02387_2014) on 28 Dec 2015. This report refers to a 10-
year-old female (ethnicity unknown) patient (b) (6)  was enrolled in the (b) (6)  study, which is a (b) (6)  
Her medical/surgical history included that the patient was 
status post tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy, which she underwent on 25 Nov 2014, fever, bronchitis and 
postoperative pain. During the period of time the patient has been enrolled in the study, there have been no 
previously reported adverse events. Concomitant medications included acetaminophen, ibuprofen and Albuterol 
(salbutamol sulfate). The patient received her first dose of the oral study drug on 25 Nov 2014, at a dose of 5 ml 
every six hours as needed for the treatment of pain. The patient received the study drug three times on 25 Nov 
2014. She received the first dose at 10:20 and the last dose at 22:20, receiving 5 ml of the study medication per 
dose. The following three days, on 26 Nov 2014, 27 Nov 2014 and 28 Nov 2014 the patient received 5 ml four times
daily with the first dose at 04:40 and last dose at 22:20, for a total daily dose of 20 ml. The patient received her 
most recent dose of the study drug prior to the event on 29 Nov 2014 at 04:20, which completed the course of 
therapy with diclofenac potassium. On (b) (6)  the mother of the patient notified the study 
coordinator that the patient had not been eating or drinking (eating disorder). Approximately (b)(6) days after the initial 
study dose, on (b) (6)  the patient developed difficulty swallowing (dysphagia), had poor intake and pain that 
was unable to be controlled. After the study coordinator inquired about the patient s urine output, it was determined 
that she had not urinated (urinary retention) in the last 8 hours. The study coordinator advised the mother to call the
surgeon's office. On(b) (6)  at 17:45, the patient presented to the emergency room where she received 
treatment with unspecified fluids for dehydration. On(b) (6)  the mother of the patient notified the study 
coordinator that the patient was being admitted for dehydration. The patient refused to eat, and developed a 
barking cough the night (cough) of (b) (6)  She was admitted through the physician's office with dehydration, 
failure to thrive and intractable pain status post tonsillectomy on (b) (6)  Upon admission to the hospital, the 
following significant laboratory tests were done: hematology results revealed a mean cell volume of 85 fl (normal 
73-83) (mean cell volume increased), MCH of 29 Pg/ml (normal 23-27) (mean cell haemoglobin concentration), 
platelet count of 405 x1000 (normal rage: 150-390) (platelet count increased), and monocytes 1.38 x1000 (normal 
range 0.2-1.0) (monocyte count increased). The patient also underwent a urinalysis which showed her urine

specific gravity was greater than 1.030 (normal 1.005 - 1.025), and a small amount of leukocytes. An analysis of the
patient's hepatic function revealed the following results: direct bilirubin, greater than 0.1 mg/dL (normal 0.1-0.5) 
(blood bilirubin decreased), LDH: 371 U/L (normal 100-250) (blood lactate dehydrogenase increased), blood 
alkaline phosphatase: 228 U/L (normal: 35-104) (blood alkaline phosphatase increased), lymphocytes count was 
27.6 % (normal: 28-48) and A/G ratio: 1.6 (normal 1.3-1.5) (albumin globulin ratio increased). As treatment, the 
patient received a bolus of unspecified intravenous fluids, followed by maintenance treatment on continuous 
intravenous fluids. The patient was also given two doses of intravenous dexamethasone (Decadron) and 24 hours 
of cefazolin sodium (Ancef). She responded well to fluids, improved tremendously, and was discharged home on (b)(6)
 Treatment with the study drug was unchanged due to the event of dehydration. The event met serious 
criteria of hospitalization. The principal investigator assessed the SAE as moderate in intensity and unrelated to the 
study drug. Outcome of the other events was not reported. Seriousness and causality of the other events were not 
reported. In the opinion of the principal investigator, the probable cause of event was due to related to her recent 
tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy surgeries.
Following an internal review on 28 Dec 2015, for the information received on 02 Dec 2014, the following changes 
were done: Captured CCAT458_NonNovartis Trial as dummy ID, added treatment drugs Decadran and Ancef and 
date of birth.
