Medically Significant
A neurologist spontaneously reported via a Biogen employee (MSL, medical science liaison) that a 39 year old 
female patient on TYSABRI (300 mg, IV, QM) for Multiple Sclerosis from unknown date to unknown date 
experienced suspected PML (onset 12 Jun 2015).  The patient received a total of 26 doses of TYSABRI with last 
infusion on 08 Jun 2015.  It was noted that the patient experienced RRMS.  The patient has no concomitant 
illnesses or medications. The patient did not have any clinical symptoms which could be suspicious for PML.  There
was no plan for liquor examination for JCV until the neurologist received another diagnosis of "MR" from an 
independent radiologist.  The patient last tested negative for JCV (presume antibodies) in Jan 2015.  A MRI (date 
unknown) showed new and active lesions in the left cerebellum.  The neurologist received only an email from the 
radiologist on 12 Jun 2015 indicating that PML couldn't be excluded as earlier MRI scans were not available to 
compare with the new MRI scans; there was no written official diagnosis on the MRI scans.   Treatment for the 
event was not provided.  The outcome for the event suspected PML is unknown. The causality for the event of 
suspected PML was assessed as related.  It is unknown if TYSABRI treatment is ongoing.
