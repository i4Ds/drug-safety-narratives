The below information is a case summary from 18 Aug 2014 to 03 Sep 2014.
This case concerns a 70 year old female on TYSABRI for MS x 56 infusions from 26 Jan 2010 to 21 Jul 2014. The 
patient's MS was diagnosed in 1991 and prior MS therapy included Avonex from 2000 to 2009. The patient had no 
history of prior immunosuppressive therapy. The patient had recently seroconverted from anti-JCV antibody 
negative to positive. She was enrolled in (b) (6)  under a prior physician and had tested anti-JCV 
antibody negative on 14 Mar 2011 (not detected, 0.074 nOD) and on 18 Jun 2012 (not detected, 0.058 nOD). Under
her current neurologist, she had tested anti-JCV antibody negative on 26 Feb 2014 (index 0.15) and on 29 May

2014 (index 0.19). On 13 Aug 2014, at time of PML suspicion, the patient tested anti-JCV antibody positive (index 
2.56). In Jun 2014, the patient presented with right upper extremity weakness. It was noted that the patient had 
been very stable of TYSABRI for many years. Findings from a brain MRI performed on 13 Jun 2014, when 
compared to 18 Jul 2013 brain MRI, were as follows: multiple white matter periventricular foci of T2 prolongation 
are again seen; several new hyperintense lesions within subcortical white matter and pons: subcortical lesion 
involving the left precentral gyrus, subcortical lesion involving the left insula, punctate lesion involving the central 
pons, and punctate lesion involving the posterior left medulla. Again, several black hole lesions on T1 images, no 
significant atrophy. No abnormal enhancement. Again no evidence of PML; findings are felt to represent 
progression of disease, although there is no evidence of active demyelination. On 28 Jun 2014, the patient tested 
negative for TYSABRI antibodies. Treatment in Jul 2014 included IV steroids x 3 days with slight improvement, 
followed by 3 additional days of IV steroids with no further improvement. On 21 Jul 2014, TYSABRI was 
administered. On 05 Aug 2014, the patient experienced worsened right upper extremity weakness and numbness, 
fatigue, as well as tingling and numbness in her left upper extremities. IV steroids x 3 days were planned, but a 
repeat MRI performed that day revealed some changes suggesting early development of PML. Specifically, when 
compared to 13 Jun 2014 MRI: interval increase in confluent FLAIR and T2 weighted signal abnormality involving 
the left precentral gyrus involving the subcortical U fibers, extending to involve into the deep white matter. No 
associated abnormal enhancement found. Additional numerous periventricular and subcortical FLAIR signal 
hyperintensities unchanged compared to prior study. Findings probably represent progression of demyelination; 
however, early PML is not excluded. On (b) (6)  the patient was admitted to the hospital. Serum JCV PCR 
was negative at this time. CSF for JCV PCR was obtained on (b) (6)  and returned positive for JCV DNA with 
inconclusive quantification from (b) (6)  Labs (received of 21 Aug 2014) and returned positive from (b) (6)  at 101 
copies/mL (received 03 Sep 2014). PLEX was started on (b) (6) , and the patient was discharged home the 
same day. Outpatient PLEX continued (11 Aug 2014, 13 Aug 2014, 15 Aug 2014, 19 Aug 2014) for a total of 5 
sessions. On 13 Aug 2014, the patient's symptoms continued, and repeat MRI performed on that date revealed: 1) 
overall, no significant change when compared to 05 Aug 2014. Similar appearance of previously described area of 
increased T2/FLAIR signal within the subcortical U fibers of the left precentral gyrus. As on prior exam, the finding 
of subcortical high T2/FLAIR signal within the precentral gyrus that demonstrates substantial increase in size 
compared to 13 Jun 2014, although similar to 05 Aug 2014, is concerning for PML although progression of 
demyelination is also included in the differential diagnosis, and 2) overall similar appearance of the multiple 
subcortical and periventricular foci of increased T2/FLAIR signal in the bilateral cerebral hemispheres and 
additionally foci of abnormal T2/FLAIR signal within the left pons and left medulla. On 20 Aug 2014, the patient was 
stable with continued symptoms, however, no new symptoms to suggest further worsening. On 21 Aug 2014, the 
patient underwent a second lumbar puncture, and CSF sent to (b) (6)  for JCV PCR returned positive at 70 copies/mL 
(received 03 Sep 2014). Mirtazapine was started on 21 Aug 2014 (15 mg, PO, QD). A repeat MRI on 25 Aug 2014 
(compared to 13 Aug 2014) revealed: multiple foci of FLAIR and T2 hyperintensity present within the corpus 
callosum, periventricular and subcortical white matter of the bilateral frontal, parietal, and left temporal lobes.

Additional abnormalities also seen within the pons and cerebellum; findings consistent with known MS. The more 
confluent area of T2 and FLAIR hyperintensity in the left posterior frontal/parietal region is again identified. This has
marginally increased in the short interval, with more definite progression seen since the examination of 05 Aug. 
There is also progressive confluent T2 and FLAIR hyperintensity in the left inferior temporal lobe. No abnormal 
enhancement.
Update 04 Sep 2014: Upon internal review, Biogen Idec considers this case to be confirmed for PML based on 
positive CSF, positive MRI, and clinical symptoms.
Update 26 Sep 2014: The neurologist spontaneously reported via a Biogen Idec MSL that the female patient had 
her first JCV antibody test of 2014 on 26 Feb 2014, which had an index value of 0.15. A second routine JCV 
antibody test (performed every 3 months) was performed on 22 May 2014 (date discrepant; previoiusly reported as 
29 May 2014), which had an index value of 0.19. A routine MRI on 13 Jun 2014 showed a suspicious lesion, which 
was reported as an MS exacerbation. The patient presented for a "work up" on 20 Jun 2014. The patient indicated 
that she was experiencing right extremity weakness starting approximately two weeks prior to the appointment. The
neurologist reported that this "was very minimal." The bedside exam was also reported as "minimal." By August, the
patient had left upper extremity weakness. The patient was admitted (presume reference to previously reported 
hospital admission) (b) (6)  and PLEX was started. At the time of this report, the patient's current 
status was clinically stable but MRI worsening. The patient is currently receiving a course of steroids (NOS) every 
3-4 weeks. The neurologist strongly feels that this case is a case of seroconversion.
Update 02 Oct 2014: Additional MRI images from 03 Sep 2014 and 19 Sep 2014 were received from the 
neurologist; corresponding reports with findings were not provided (received images only).
Update 23 Feb 2015: Additional information was received from the neurologist via a Standardized PML Data 
Collection Tool. The patient is alive, residing at home, and is not currently on any MS therapy. The neurologist 
assessed the patient's estimated Karnofsky and EDSS scores on 18 Feb 2015 to be 50 (requires considerable 
assistance and frequent medical care) and 8.0. A brain MRI was performed on 13 Feb 2015 with results reported 
as follows: mild decrease in extent of confluent FLAIR hyperintensities within the left cerebral hemisphere. There is 
persistent enhancement, unchanged. No new areas of enhancement are seen. Stable appearance of FLAIR 
hyperintense lesions within the right cerebral hemisphere and cervical cord. Test results post-PML on 14 Jan 2015 
include leukocyte count 7.18 X10(3)/UL (normal range: 4.3 - 10.0), lymphocyte count of 1.54 X10(3)/UL (normal 
range: 1.0 - 4.80) and creatinine 0.91. The patient was diagnosed with IRIS (onset (b) (6) ), which was 
determined by clinical symptoms and MRI findings. IRIS symptoms (onset (b) (6) ) included aphasia / apraxia 
(cognitive / behavioral), right hemiparesis (motor), and aphasia (speech).  The patient received corticosteroids pre-
IRIS onset as well as post-IRIS onset. Treatment for IRIS included Solumedrol (methylprednisolone) 1000 mg IV

daily for three days, monthly since (b) (6)  and is ongoing. As of 18 Feb 2015, the neurologist indicated that 
the events of PML and IRIS were "recovered" but also noted that the patient was "improving" from both events 
(presumed events to be ongoing but improving). Causality for the events was assessed as related to TYSABRI.

A. Natalizumab-Related PML Is Possible Even With Recent Negative JCV Antibody Testing. 67th Annual Meeting 
of the American Academy of Neurology (AAN); Washington, DC USA. 17 Apr 2015. The authors describe a case of
PML in a patient on TYSABRI whose last John Cunningham virus (JCV) antibody testing 2 weeks before onset of 
symptoms was negative.  A 70-year-old woman who had been on TYSABRI for more than 4 years and had never 
received immunosuppressants developed PML symptoms of progressive right arm weakness 2 weeks after last 
negative anti-JCV antibody testing (index value 0.19). The initial brain MRI was reported as having a new MS lesion
but short-term repeat MRI raised the concern for PML and CSF JCV PCR came back positive. While prior routine 
JCV antibody retesting every 3 months per clinic standard had been negative until 2 weeks prior to onset of 
symptoms, at time of diagnosis serum anti-JCV antibody was positive with an index of 2.56. Previously, 2 
TYSABRI-treated multiple sclerosis PML patients were anti-JCV antibody negative but testing dated from 8 and 9 
months before diagnosis (see MCNs 2012BI060371 and 2012BI019074, respectively). Conclusions: Negative anti-
JCV antibody patients are still at risk for the development of PML because of the potential for de novo infection as 
well as possibly false negative test result, of which the reported rate is 3%.
Update 22 Apr 2015: A report was received from the literature via a poster: Brosseau M-S, Stobbe G, Cramer D, 
Lipe H, Wundes A. Natalizumab-related PML 2 weeks after negative anti-JCV antibody. Presented at the 67th 
Annual Meeting of the American Academy of Neurology (AAN); Washington, DC USA. 17 Apr 2015. The authors 
describe a case of PML in a 70 year old female patient on TYSABRI. In May 2014, the patient's brain MRI had been
stable for years as had her MS course; she had an EDSS score of 2.0.  In Jun 2014 the patient's routine annual 
MRI showed 4 new nonenhancing lesions, with no evidence of PML and the patient was experiencing new, mild, 
right hand weakness and increased fatigue. The patient received a 3-day course of IV methylprednisolone (1gm 
daily) for presumed MS Relapse. In Jul 2014, the patient's right hand weakness had progressed and she received a
2nd 3-day course of IV methylprednisolone (1gm daily). In (b) (6)  MRI results showed an increase in non-
enhancing FLAIR hyperintense lesion involving left precentral gyrus. Now extending in subcortical U fibers. Early 
PML not excluded. The patient's right hand was now floppy, with mild proximal weakness of right arm. A trial of 
mirtazapine was initiated, but then stopped after 2 weeks due to drowsiness. In Sep 2014, MRI results showed 
progressive increase in size of confluent white matter lesion; no enhancement, and the patient experienced rapid 
progression of neurological impairment - right hemiparesis and speech impairment. Three day courses of IV 
methylprednisolone were given every 2 to 4 weeks for IRIS and continued through to the time of this report. MRI 
results from Oct 2014 showed minimal enhancement (1st time). PML lesions continued to sprawl. The patient 
reached a nadir: right hemiplegia, global aphasia and severe apraxia. Maraviroc therapy was initiated for IRIS.  In

Nov 2014, MRI results showed enhancement at its zenith. PML lesions worse. The patient's clinical course was 
unchanged. MRI results from Dec until the time of this report showed a slight decrease in extent of PML lesions. 
Enhancement slowly decreases but persists. The patient experienced mild amelioration of language, small non 
anti-gravity movements in right hemibody. The patient s MRI images (from Jun 2014 through Nov 2014) were 
included on the poster in addition to information from the abstract that was previously reported on Update 16 Mar 
Update 05 Aug 2015: Additional information was received from the neurologist via a MS Standardized PML Data 
Collection Tool. The patient is alive, residing at home, and currently on Copaxone (glatiramer) since 01 Jul 2015 
due to clinical findings and radiological evidence of return of MS. Test result reported: 29 May 2015 creatinine 0.70.
The patient's assessed Karnofsky and EDSS scores on 29 Jul 2015 are 40 (disabled; requires special care and 
assistance) and 8.0. A brain MRI was performed on 24 Jul 2015 (results not provided) and on 29 Jul 2015 with the 
following results: unchanged confluent FLAIR hyperintensities involving the left greater than right periventricular and
subcortical white matter, as well as unchanged patchy enhancement involving the abnormal white matter on the 
left. Findings are consistent with given history of multiple sclerosis with PML. Persistent patchy enhancement on the
left may also be secondary to an inflammatory etiology. The patient was assessed on 29 Jul 2015 as not recovered 
from events of PML and IRIS. Causality for the events of PML and IRIS was assessed as related to TYSABRI.
