This clinical trial 11111111111. case concerns a 72 year-old Black female. Medical history included: Stage IV 
non-small cell lung cancer, hypertension, anxiety, depression, hyperlipidemia and gastrooesophageal reflux disease 
(GERD). Concomitant medications included folic acid and vitamin B12 supplementation. The patient was receiving 
hyd 0 o  bitartrate/acetaminophen for pain, which was well controlled, but due to taking it too frequently the 
patient was ch 0 ,0 to a fentanyl patch. Additional concomitant medications included trihexyphenidyl, mirtazapine, 
fexofenidine, toff o  e, mefformin, ramipril, chlorpromazine, insulin glargine, prochlorperazine, eszopictone and 
warfarin, all for unspecified indications. On 02-Sep-2010, the patient first received intravenous (IV) pemetrexed 
(I. . (Alimta, 500mg/m2) in combination with IV carboplatin (6 area under the curve, AUC) every 21 days, for 
the treatment of nen-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Date of last dose prior to event was not confirmed. Her 
oxygen saturations prior to emergency room (ER) admission were 95-96% on room air. Onal111110

days after last receiving study therapy, patient presented to the ER with chief complaint of moderate to severe 
sh 0 a of breath (SOB), grade 3. The ER physician identified the episode as acute dyspnea. While in the ER, 
the patient de .00 -0 a new onset of atrial fibrillation (not reported as a serious adverse event). The patient was 
treated with oxygen and diltiazem hydrochlaide. Echocardiogram (ECG) from showed atrial fibrillation 
with rapid ventricular response; nonspecific ST and T wave abnormality, probably digital s effect. On the same date, 
a chest x-ray was performed showed enlarging left effusion (not reported as a serious adverse event). She was 
admitted as an inpatient oneilli 0 a chest computer tomogram (CT), with and without 
contrast, showed no evidencer  oprulmonary embolism; pleural rind and/or loculated malignant effusion on the left 
with associated pleural based nodular densities and parenchymal abnormalities; likely metastases to the right lung. 
On the same date, an ultrasound guided left thoracentesis was performed and 25 cc of yellow, clear fluid was 
removed but not sent for cytology. Complete b1000 count (CBC) results included: white cell count 13A, hemoglobin 
9.9, and platelets 288. See source document for further lab details and hospital  records, including ECG results. 
Oxygen saturation, while on 2 liters of oxygen, averaged 95-99%. On the patient recovered from the 
shortness of breath. As the patient remained in the intensive care unit (ICU). Study therapy was 
ued. This case is lin o o o case ID: US201011001817. The investigator considered the event 
3 shortness of breath to be unrelated to pemetrexed and carboplatin. Relatedness against protocol 
was not assessed. Update 14-Sep-2010: Upon review, corrected study type in the narrative. 
Removed investigator initiated trial and added clinical trial to narrative on y. Update 20-Oct-2010: Additional 
Information received on 11-Oct-2010; outcome as recovered on   supplementation as per protocol, 
added 0 0.0 tant medications for pain and ECG results. Narrative and relevant fields updated. Update 03-Dec-
2010: Additional Information received on 24-Nov-2010 from investigator Added concomitant medications. 
Confirmation received that events of atrial fibrillation and pleural effusion were not considered serious adverse 
events but adverse events. Case and narrative updated accordingly.
