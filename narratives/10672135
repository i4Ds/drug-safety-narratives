SEP-2012.
The subject was treated with ibrutinib (capsule, oral) 420 mg once a day, initiated on 29-OCT-2012 for chronic 
lymphocytic leukemia. Concomitant medications included levetiracetam, dexamethasone, paracetamol for pain, 
omeprazole, docusate sodium for constipation, valaciclovir hydrochloride, multivitamins, sulfamethoxazole and 
trimethoprim,  lidocaine/prilocaine, immunoglobulin human, deferoxamine, ciprofloxacin, and estradiol.
The subject had several recent hospitalizations, (b) (6)  to (b) (6) , (b) (6)  to (b) (6)  and
(b) (6)  to (b) (6)  for fever and recurrent Klebsiella bacteremia. She had been treated with 
ceftriaxone and was on chronic ciprofloxacin. She continued to receive IVIG. Her port was removed during the 
(b) (6)  hospitalization and she was temporarily off Desferal (deferoxamine).
On (b) (6)  the subject was hospitalized for an acute onset of slurred speech, dysarthria, numbness on the 
lower left side of the face and slight facial droop, and weakness and numbness on the left side of tongue. She was 
able to furrow her forehead and had no extremity weakness or paresthesia. Work up was notable for a right frontal 
love mass. She was evaluated by both neurology and neurosurgery and was started on prophylactic Keppra 
(levetiracetam). Given the location of her mass, a biopsy was not deemed to be a safe option. Two lumbar 
punctures were performed and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) demonstrated a pleocytosis with apredominance of 
lymphocytes. Flow cytometry and cytology was negative. Her symptoms of facial droop and dysarthria had 
somewhat improved without intervention, but continued to persist.  She was discharged on(b) (6)  It was 
noted she was beyond 1 year of CD20 antibody treatment and did not have other associated immune suppressive 
drugs.
On 20-NOV-2014, a brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed T2 hyperintense changes in the subcortical 
white matter of the right frontal lobe which seemed to have slightly progressed in comparison to the prior exam of

involvement by CLL, infection or other demyelinating process was favored over a subacute infarct given the slight 
progression rather than improvement in T2 changes. 
On 25-NOV-2014, laboratory data included white blood cells (WBC) 13.1, hemoglobin (Hgb) 14.5, packed cell 
volume (PCV) 40, platelet count (Plt-Ct) 144, red blood cells (RBC) 3.70, mean corpuscular volume (MCV) 115, 
mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH) 39.2, mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC)  34.1, red cell 
distribution width (RDW) 14.1, sodium (Na) 140, potassium (K) 4.2, chloride (Cl) 100, CO2  31,blood urea nitrogen 
(BUN) 13, creatinine 0.60, glucose 96, anion gap 9, calcium 10.5, prothombin time- international normalized ratio 
(PT-INR) 1.0, partial thromboplastin time (PTT)  25.2, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) 192, alkaline phosphatase 79, 
total bilirubin 0.4, albumin 4.5, and uric acid 6.0. She had iron overload (elevated ferritin and transaminases); 
deferoxamine had been temporarily suspended. 
From (b) (6)  to(b) (6)  she was hospitalized for a craniotomy to biopsy the lesion. The pathology 
was suspicious for progressive multifocal encephalopathy (PML). She felt well, but still had some facial droop and 
weakness of the tongue. She received a short, tapered course of dexamethasone per neurosurgery. She had 
resumed ibrutinib.
On 08-DEC-2014, the final pathology report of the right frontal lesion of the brain showed progressive multifocal 
leukoencephalopathy.  The report comments included: sections of the brain biopsy specimen included gray and 
white matter; multiple foci of perivas; chronic inflammation seen in the gray matter while the white matter showed 
gliosis and a diffuse inflammatory infiltrate; reactive astrocytes, including Creutzfeldt astrocytes, were highlighted by
GFAP Stain; CD68 immunohistochemistry demonstrated increased numbers of phagocytes and CD3-positive T 
cells and CD5-positive cells were seen in perivascular aggregates and diffuse in the white matter, SV40 
immunohistochemistry labels the enlarged, glassy nuclei of abnormal oligodendroglial cells which indicated 
infection by polyomavirus; nuclear reactivity for p53 and are also seen in the abnormal oligodendroglial cells; 
neurofilament and NAeuN stains confirmed sampling of white and gray matter; LFB/PAS stains showed no well-
demarcated foci of demyelination. The CD3, CD20, PAX-5, and CD5 stained slides and flow cytometry findings 
(F14-1857) were reviewed by hematopathology, and a small number of abnormal cells expressing CD5 were seen. 
This finding favored a representation of incidental involvement of the brain lesion by CLL, rather than a primary 
CLL/SLL lesion. 
The detection of presence of the JC virus could not be confirmed at the outside facility where the diagnosis was 
made. However, additional testing and workup is currently ongoing at the investigational site.
From (b) (6)  to (b) (6)  the subject was hospitalized for observation for a self-reported episode of 
seizure.  She continued on Ibrutinib while hospitalized.

The dose of ibrutinib was not changed. She had prolonged partial remission (PR) to ibrutinib. 
The subject outcome was unspecified for progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy.
The investigator considered the causality between Ibrutinib and progressive multifocal leukoencephalopthy as 
possible.
This report is serious (hospitalization).

The previous drug history was updated as follows:  1st, chlorambucil from MAY-2005 to JUN-2006, with rituximab 
given in spring 2006, she had a partial response which lasted 2 years (progressive lymphocytosis and abdominal 
pain and gastrointestinal symptoms with bulky adenopathy in the abdomen); 2nd, chlorambucil in OCT-2008, given 
with prednisone in FEB-2009 with no response; 3rd, PCR for 2 cycles in MAR 2009 and APR-2009, this was 
complicated by pneumonia and she was treatment free for 1 year; 4th, rituximab weekly x4 from MAR-2010 to 
APR-2010, progressive lymphocytosis, bulky abdominal nodes and splenomegaly, 6 months; 5th CVP for 1 cycle in 
OCT-2010, then R-CVP on 17-NOV-2010, complicated by jaw pain and constipation, but she had decreased 
adenopathy and was treatment free x3 months; 6th, bendamustine and rituximab x 2 cycles in FEB-2011 and MAR-
2011, she had IVIG from 19-MAY-2011 to 20-AUG-2013; 7th, high dose methylprednisolone and rituximab in JUN-
2012 and JUL-2012, pretreatment laboratory data included WBC 208.3, hemoglobin 8.4, platelets 70,000, and after
treatment on 23-JUL-2012, the WBC 113.7, hemoglobin 10.5, platelets 68, and she had increasing adenopathy; 
and 8th, ofatumumab, 8 weekly doses from JUL-2012 to 24- SEP-2012.
On 29-OCT-2012, ibrutinib was started. At the time of initiation of Ibrutinib, a physical assessment showed the liver 
was 8 cm below right costal margin (BRCM), cervical nodes multiple 3 x 3 cm, axillary node masses 4 x 5 cm 
(right), 8 x 9 cm left, and inguinal area 2 x 2 cm bilaterally. Laboratory data included WBC 33.2, hemoglobin 8.1

neck nodes up to 3.7 cm, axillary nodes up to 6 cm, abdominal/pelvic adenopathy up to 9 cm; liver measured 24 cm
craniocaudal; bone marrow was 75 cellular with > 90% CLL,  erythroid precursors  were markedly decreased. She 
had lymphocytosis with WBC rising to 214 by DEC-2012. Lymph nodes (LN), on physical exam, steadily decreased.
By DEC-2012, LN were 1 centimeter or less.  The batch number for ibrutinib was L0403955 with expiration date of 
OCT-2015).

On 16-NOV-2014, a lumbar puncture was performed (results not provided). 
The subject indicated the CNS symptoms improved slightly with levetiracetam.
Dexamethasone started on 26-NOV-2014 and completed taper on 04-DEC-2014. 
On 22-DEC-2014, the subject was examined by the investigator. She "looked great". She still had minor residual 
facial drop but her cognition and performance were intact.  A lumbar puncture was done.  Results were pending for 
lumbar puncture, JC virus and HIV testing. The subject continued on Ibrutinib. The investigator believed the subject
had an atypical case presentation of PML.  The event was G2. Laboratory data included sodium 139, potassium

Additional information received from an investigator on 29-DEC-2014.
The JC/BK virus was negative in the cerebral spinal fluid; the plasma was still pending. 
Additional information was received from an investigator on 05-JAN-2015. 
On an unreported date, CSF analysis showed a 97% viability with WBC 93; protein 81, and glucose 86. There was 
high protein content and 95% predominance of lymphocytes, which were almost all T cells. The serum JC antibody 
was positive indicating prior exposure to the JC virus; and the CSF polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for the JC 
virus was negative.
The investigator confirmed the subject's lip tremor had started more than a year ago. During the office visit on 22-
DEC-2014, the subject only had some residual symptoms, but there was a tremendous improvement in her 
condition which was unusual presentation for PML and she did not look like a patient who had PML. 
The investigator agreed that without the presence of the JC virus in the CSF, it was difficult to characterize this 
condition as a PML, but the results appear to indicate some sort of viral infection. The examination of the brain 
biopsy specimen was still pending. 
The investigator was to communicate his findings to the subject on her next follow-up office visit on 06-JAN-2015.
Additional medically important information was received from the investigator on 28-JAN-2015.
On an unspecified date, the subject was admitted to the hospital for worsening neurological symptoms which the 
investigator considered to be a continuation of the previously reported event of PML.

Additional information was received from the investigator on 06-FEB-2015.
Concomitant medications included oxcarbazepine and lorazepam for seizures. The dose of concomitant medication
levetiracetam was updated.
On 17-NOV-2014, Immunoglobulin G level was 455 and on 03-JAN-2015 it was 376.
On 04-JAN-2015, renal ultrasound demonstrated no obstruction/ hydrnephrosis/ abscess and renal stone was 
present.
On (b) (6)  the subject was seen in the emergency room with complaints of progressive weakness of her left 
arm and then left leg with loss of sensation over the last week and a half. The subject had also had difficulty with 
speech and swallowing. She had fallen two or three times in a week due to her left sided weakness, without loss of 
consciousness, although she did hit her head once. There was no bleeding associated with the falls. Two weeks 
prior to presentation, the subject could use the restroom independently, as per her husband, but currently she 
needed more help at home. The subject was admitted to hospital with inability to move her left arm, weakness in 
the left leg, left facial nerve palsy, and 12th nerve weakness. The subject was afebrile; more confused (as per 
husband) and had difficulty with short term memory, but was alert and oriented times 3 on examination. The subject
had no seizure since last hospitalization but out of concern she had taken two lorazepam. A consultation note from 
admission stated that the subject's previous brain biopsy was consistent with progressive multifocal 
leukoencephalopathy, thought to be due to rituximab. PCR of the CSF screening for the JC virus was negative so 
there was no question about the diagnosis of PML. Computerized CT scan of head without contrast demonstrated 
interval increasing edema involving the right frontal lobe with increased local mass effect, new mild right to left 
midline shift and post-surgical changes of prior right frontal lobe biopsy. Treatment included Decadron 
(dexamethasone, intravenous, 10 mg) and anti-seizure medicine was continued. These events were considered by 
the investigator to be a continuation of the previous serious adverse event of multifocal leukoencephalopathy. 
On (b) (6)  relevant lab diagnostic provided were (range and units not provided): WBC count: 12.9, PCV

saturation (venous) 62, brain natriuretic peptide 18, urine analysis: 4 white blood cells. Bronchoscopy and bronchial 
washing from 09-JAN-2015 had shown small population of monotypic B-Cell consistent with CLL but possibly 
contaminant from peripheral blood. The physician commented that the subject may have some lung damage either 
due to CLL or due to chemotherapy. Chest X-ray showed small pleural effusion. The subject had recently finished a
course of antibiotics as an outpatient. Sputum culture and blood cultures were ordered. Ciprofloxacin and

Additional information was received from the investigator on 26-FEB-2015.
On an unspecified date, right frontal lobe lesion biopsy of the brain was re-read by the pathology department and 
final diagnosis of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) was confirmed. The report comments 
included: Sections showed small fragments of brain with reactive astrocytosis and enlarged oligodendrocytes 
demonstrating chromatin margination consistent with PML. This was confirmed by the included positive SV40 stain 
performed at the outside institution. Small perivascular lymphocytic collections are noted in the gray matter area. 
Additional included immunostains were as follows. GFAP showed reactive astrocytosis. NeuN highlighted neurons. 
Neurofilament stained the CNS background tissue. LFB-PAS did not demonstrate definite demyelination. CD68 
highlighted macrophages and activated microglia. CD3 and CD5 stain scattered lymphocytes. CD20 and PAX5 
were negative. p53 and Ki-67 highlighted the atypical SV-40 positive cells. Included controls showed appropriate 
reactivity.
Additional information was received from the investigator on 01-JUN-2015. 
The subject passed away on (b) (6)  from worsening PML. It was unspecified if an autopsy was performed. 
The subject's husband reported that the subject was in hospice and continued to take study medication up to 3 
days before she died (action with ibrutinib changed to withdrawn). 
Additional serious criterion includes death.
