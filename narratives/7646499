This post marketing study case (H3E-JE-HS01), concerns a 79-year-old male patient. The patient's medical 
history included pneumonia, chronic hepatitis C, and metastases to the lymph nodes. He smoked 20 cigarettes a 
day for 59 years. He previously received carboplatin and paclitaxel (end date: 24-Jun-2009) as first line 
chemotherapy and vinorelbine (end date: 13-Oct-2009) as second line chemotherapy. He received multipile 
concomitant medications including folic acid and vitamin B12. His laboratory data on 29-Oct-2009 was as follows: 
body temperature (BT) 37.0 C degrees, oxygen saturation (SpO2) 95%, red blood cell (RBC) 360x10E4/mm3, 
white blood cell (WBC) 3030/mm3, neutrophil percentage (NP) 36.6%, lymphocyte percentage 40.2%, lactate 
dehydrogenase (LDH) 189IU/L, c-reactive protein (CRP) 2.7mg/dL. The patient received intravenous pemetrexed 
(Alimta) 710mg for lung adenocarcinoma stage IIla beginning on 02-Nov-2009, which was the only dose he 
received. On 06-Nov-2009, he experienced hepatic function disorder which study investigator considered as non-
serious. He was treated with glycyrrhizic acid/ dl-methionine combined drug and liver hydrolystate combined drug. 
On __days after starting pemetrexed, he was diagnosed with obstructive pneunomia, 
hypoxaemia and CRP increased which prolonged hospitalization. He also had slight fever. Tumors caused stenosis 
from right main bronchus to intermedius. He started to receive levofloxacin for the treatment of obstructive 
pneumonia. Lab date included BT 37.3 C degrees, Sp02 93%, RBC 335x10E4/mm3 and CRP 5.5mg/dL. On 
MOM he developed pyrexia. Lab date included BT 38.1 C degrees and SpO2 93%. On_, x-ray 
showed the area of infiltration in the middle right lung field. Levoflaxacin was switched to ceftazidime and 
clindamycin due to CRP increased and pyrexia. Lab date included BT 37.8 C degrees, WBC 3620/mm3, NP 47.7%, 
lymphocyte percentage 32.2% and CRP 9.9mg/dL. On 13-Nov-2009, clindamycin was discontinued. On gin, 
_he was recovered from pyrexia and hypoxaemia. Lab date included BT 36.9 C degrees and SpO2 95%. On 
18-Nov-2009, ceftazidime was discontinued because his clinical findings were improved. On he was 
recovered from obstructive pneumonia and recovering from CRP increased. Lab date included WBC 3020/mm3, 
lymphocyte percentage 35.9% and CRP 0.8mg/dL. The study investigator determined the discontinuation of 
pemetrexed due to the onset of hepatic function disorder and obstructive pneumonia, and also disease 
progression. The study investigator stated that obstructive pneumonia, hypoxaemia, CRP increased and pyrexia 
were related to pemetrexed. He also stated that the obstructive pneumonia was possibly related to his primary 
disease, the pyrexia and hypoxaemia were possibly caused by the obstructive pneumonia, and CRP increased was 
possibly related to the obstructive pneumonia and his primary disease.
