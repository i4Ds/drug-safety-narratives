A medical doctor spontaneously reported that a 43 year old female patient on TYSABRI (300 mg, IV, QM) for 
Multiple Sclerosis from unknown date to unknown date was hospitalized from (b) (6)  to an unknown date for 
suspect PML characterized by Giddiness and weakness in body (Hemiparesis) (onset (b) (6) ). On an 
unknown date, an MRI was performed and the medical doctor suspected PML based on the lesions on MRI. The 
event of suspect PML is ongoing. The causality for the event of suspect PML was assessed as possibly related.  It 
is unknown if TYSABRI treatment is ongoing.
Update 25 Mar 2015: Upon follow-up, the medical doctor spontaneously reported that the patient received 12 doses
of TYSABRI from July 2013 or Aug 2013 to Aug 2014. TYSABRI therapy was restarted in Oct 2014 after a gap of 2 
months and the last dose of TYSABRI was in Jan 2015. The patient received total 16 infusions of TYSABRI.
Update 27 Mar 2015: Upon receipt of standardized MS data collection tool from the medical doctor, the following 
information was provided. The patient was on TYSABRI from 07 Sep 2012 to 10 Jan 2015 (discrepant from the 
previous dosing information) and TYSABRI therapy was interrupted from Nov 2013 to Sep 2014 due to high JCV 
index of 3.91. Multiple Sclerosis was diagnosed on 20 Jul 2012. The Multiple Sclerosis symptoms prior to 
suspected PML included motor symptoms of bilateral leg weakness (right greater than left) (onset 05 Jul 2012), 
cerebellar symptoms of unsteadiness and vertigo (onset 07 Jul 2012), sensory symptoms of heaviness and 
numbness all over the body (onset 07 Jul 2012). The patient was being evaluated for PML as the patient presented 
with clinical signs and symptoms that prompted MRI which revealed suspicious findings. The clinical signs and 
symptoms included cognitive symptoms of memory block and difficulty in teaching (onset 05 Mar 2015); motor 
symptoms including bilateral leg weakness and left hemiparesis (onset (b) (6) ); sensory symptoms including 
bilateral numbness in lower limbs (onset(b) (6) ). The patient did not receive any prior immunosuppressant 
therapy. Prior immunomodulatory therapies for Relapsing Remitting Multiple Sclerosis (RRMS) included Rebif 
(interferon beta- 1a; 22 UG, SC, TIW) from 14 Feb 2014 to 15 Mar 2014, and Copaxone (Glatiramer acetate; 20 
mg, SC, OD) from 15 Jun 2014 to 21 Jun 2014. Laboratory testing included MRI performed on (b) (6)
suspect PML on basis of the lesions on MRI; an MRI preformed on 11 Sep 2014 prior to suspected PML diagnosis, 
results not provided. A lumbar puncture was performed on (b) (6)  results are pending. On 07 Sep 2012, the 
patient was tested positive for anti-JCV antibodies; and on 25 Nov 2013, the patient was again tested positive for 
anti-JCV antibodies with index value of 3.91. On 10 Jan 2015, laboratory test results included: leukocyte count 9490
(units and reference range not provided), lymphocyte count 51% (reference range not provided), absolute 
lymphocyte count 5374 (units and reference range not provided). On (b) (6)  laboratory test results included: 
leukocyte count 6760 (units and reference range not provided), lymphocyte count 31% (reference range not 
provided), absolute lymphocyte count 2175 (units and reference range not provided). On (b) (6)  CSF 
analysis was performed and the result was abnormal including lymphocyte count 10 cells/mm3, protein 77 mg%, 
sugar 106 mg%, and no microorganism seen in gram's stain, negative for Cryptococci. Treatment for the event of 
suspect PML included corticosteroids (1 gm, IV, OD) on (b) (6)

Update 30 Mar 2015: Upon follow-up, MRI images from 19 Jul 2012, 30 Aug 2012, 28 Aug 2012, 28 Jan 2014, 10 
Sep 2014, 01 Nov 2014, and (b) (6)  were provided.
Update 03 Apr 2015: Upon follow-up, a health care professional spontaneously reported that the CSF JCV DNA 
PCR test (presumed for lumbar puncture performed on (b) (6) ) has been expedited and results were 
expected early next week.  It was further reported that as communicated by the medical doctor on phone, the 
patient had shown improvement on motor function, speech, and overall neurological condition as compared to 
when the patient was admitted.
Update 06 Apr 2015: Upon follow-up, a health care professional spontaneously reported that the CSF JCV DNA 
PCR (presumed for lumbar puncture performed on(b) (6) ) resulted negative at (b) (6) lab in the US. The 
patient was clinically stable at the time of this report. The MRI CD from the medical doctor would be available to 
Biogen tomorrow.
Update 07 Apr 2015: Upon follow-up, all available MRI images were provided by the medical doctor. The new MRI 
examination dates were (b) (6)  and (b) (6)
Update 16 Apr 2015: Upon follow-up, the JCV testing report was provided by the medical doctor. As per the testing 
report, CSF JCV DNA PCR testing performed on (b) (6)  resulted negative (reference range < 50 copies/ml). 
The patient denied consent towards the ICF at the time of this report and thus, repeat lumbar puncture would not 
be performed. The medical doctor would provide repeat MRI for the patient whenever it is done.
Update 26 May 2015: Follow-up information was received from the physician. The patient's current clinical status is 
stable and slightly improved on EDSS (no specific numerical improvement quoted) as compared to EDSS at the 
time of last hospital admission. There were no new MRI imaging done since last reported (last MRI date was (b)(6)  
(b) (6) ). The final diagnosis was reported as [questionable] post-natalizumab IRIS.
Update 18 Aug 2015: Follow-up information was received from the neurologist. Since the patient's follow-up in May 
2015, a repeat brain MRI was performed in Jun 2015 [exact date not reported] which showed improvement in lesion
counts. The patient is stable and has further improved; EDSS score improved by 1 point. The patient is currently on
MS therapy Tecfidera (dimethyl fumarate) which was started 8 weeks prior.
Update 17 Sep 2015: Biogen has downgraded this case to low suspect based on negative CSF, clinical 
improvement, MD rule out and alternative diagnosis of post-TYSBRI IRIS. The patient is now on Tecfidera 
(dimethyl fumarate).
