Case reference number DKUJ1093141, is a spontaneous case received from a SHARE representative on behalf of 
the mother of a patient. Additional information was provided by a physician:.  
This case concerns a 5-year-old male who was administered Sabril (vigabatrin, Strength: 500 mg) powder for oral 
solution, 16 mL or 800 mg BID on an unknown date for generalized convulsive epilepsy, with intractable epilepsy. 
Additional information indicated that Sabril was increased at an unknown dose on an unknown date. 
On 13/May/2013, the patient was seen by neurology and doing fairly well, at that time, on a higher dose of Sabril, 
and a higher VNS duty cycle. By report, he normally had about one 15 to 30 second seizure a day and then 4 to 5 
smaller events that were jerking or drop-type seizures . 
Prior to hospitalization, the mother indicated that her son had been having more seizures throughout the day for 
several days but none were prolonged. In 1.111111.110he was discharged from the hospital due to sleep apnea, 
dysphagia and laryngomalacia and underwent microlaryngoscopy and bronchoscopy, suppragiottoplasty, T&A and 
4 ductal ligation of salivary glands (surgery performed on IMMM1. The mother reported that since the surgery, 
he had continued with upper respiratory infection symptoms but denied fever, vomiting, diarrhea or any other 
problems. 
On 1.11111.11111 after an unspecified duration of Sabril, the patient experienced status epilepticus, increased 
seizures, upper respiratory symptoms, and Moraxella pneumonia. It was reported that while the patient was playing 
in his room, he experienced jerking-type seizures and full body jerks. The mother reported he had a seizure at 
08:15 AM and the parents interrogated the vagal nerve stimulator with a magnet with no resulting change. They 
administered IDiastat and he continued to have a seizure which lasted approximately 1 hour and 45 minutes. The 
emergency medical services were called and he was transferred to the hospital. The patient had a temperature 
maximum (Tmax) of 39.5. The jerking-type, full body jerk seizures were captured on video EEG and appeared to 
somewhat increase around 17:00. He was treated with Ativan 1 mg IV X 4, loaded with Keppra, and Fosphenytoin. 
Pre-intubation ABG (22/Jun/2013) 7.24/52/102/26/-1. He was intubated to protect his airway due to altered mental 
status, due to seizure and Propofoi, Versed, Succinimide and Vecuronium were administered. Neurology stated 
that due to the severely abnormal EEG background, only clinical seizures lasting longer than 1 minute would be 
treated. After starting protocol, no further seizures were noted. The patient was started on Claforan, video EEG 
monitoring, nothing by mouth (NPO) and intravenous fluids (IVF). A bronchiolar lavage (BAL), blood culture and 
respiratory pathogen PCR were performed. The blood culture and respiratory pathogen PCR were negative but the 
BAL was greater than 100,000 Moraxella. A physician indicated that the patient was given 1 normal saline bolus 
(date unknown) due to decreased perfusion and tachycardia shortly after admission, but otherwise was stable since 
that time.

On the'patient was in the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU). He experienced clinical seizures again 
and was changed to morphine and versed drips and propofoi was discontinued. He was loaded with Keppra and 
the dose was increased to 600 mg BID, but he continued to seize. He was then loaded with Fosphenytoin and 
placed on a maintenance dose. After the Fosphenytoin, the clinical seizures stopped. Versed was bolused as 
needed for seizures. Magnesium level was low (result unknown) and he was administered magnesium sulfate X 1. 
His ventilator settings included pressure regulated volume control (PRVC) mode, tidal volume (Vt) of 110, rate of 
30, positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) 6, positive inspiratory pressure (PIP) 10-17, fraction of inspired oxygen 
(F102) 40 percent, mean airway pressure (MAP) 10-17, with a blood gas (arterial or venous not indicated) of pH 
7.29, p002 41, p02 109, HCO3 19.5, BE -5.9. Claforan IV was initiated for a 7 day course. Treatment included 
intrapulmonary percussive ventilator (IPV) 0 6 hours (hr) and Ketocal via gastrostomy tube (G-tube) was started. A 
physician indicated the patient had respiratory failure. 
On a physician indicated that the patient continued in respiratory failure, was hemodynamically stable, 
had mild anemia (Hct 32.4), had low blood sugar (BS 56), decreased urine output (BUN/CR less than 2/0.2) and 
increased agitation. Versed was slowly weaned and sedation was held in anticipation for extubation. The patient 
had to be restarted on Precedex for sedation to keep him in the bed. Venous blood gas (VBG) was 7.35/41/65/23/-
2.3. The patient was treated with 010 for low blood sugar (BS came up to 107), Lasix X1 for decreased urine output 
(Foley removed), continuous morphine 1V was increased for agitation and Miralax was increased to BID. On an 
unknown date, a repeat Fosphenytoin level was ordered due to elevation. According to neurology, the 
electroencephalogram was at his baseline and he was not having any seizures, so Versed was ordered to be slowly 
weaned. The ventilator settings were PRVC mode, Vt 110, rate 30, PIP 16-18, F102 30 percent MAP 16-18, with 
blood gas (not specified arterial/venous) pH 7.38, p002 38, pC2 58, HCO3 22.5, BE -2.3. Chest x-ray revealed 
aeration mildly improved, multifocal atelectasis mildly increased, 8 mm density continues to project in gastric fundus 
region and may represent ingested foreign body or tooth. The ventilator settings were changed to wean respiratdry 
rate to 25 and to recheck VBG in one hour. A physician indicated the patient was afebrile and made an assessment 
of Moraxella pneumonia (continue with Claforan). Ophthalmology consult obtained for eye exam, after mother 
reported that the patient had been scheduled to have one as an outpatient as a requirement for Sabril therapy and 
he was cleared to continue Sabril. 
On 411101111111111the patient was placed on CPAP and then extubated. He experienced worsening stridor post-
extubation, as compared to baseline and ENT consult was obtained. The patient was scoped at the bedside with 
results showing airway edema. In addition to the above treatment mentioned, the patient was treated with multiple 
vapors. No stool since Thursday and Milk of Magnesia BID was started. 
On el mins the patient was on CPAP and BiPap 38 -1.The patient was scoped at the beside, with results 
showing postcricoid airway edema. A pediatric pulmonary specialist was consulted and assessed the patient had

stridor and basil atelectasis (left greater than right). He ordered Decadron IV 06 hours and cough assist Q 4 hours. 
The ENT physician noted mild retractions and increased shortness of breath in the morning. A pulmonary consult 
was ordered and he indicated the patient had previously been followed by pulmonary as an outpatient. The patient 
had 2 stools and therefore Milk of Magnesia was discontinued and Miralax held. Precedex was increased. A 
palliative care consult was obtained. 
On 27/Jun/2013, Precedex was discontinued for BiPAP discontinuation and then restarted. In addition, Clonidine 
patch was added for withdrawal. The patients oxygen saturations (Sp02) were 96-100 percent, with 1 desaturation 
to 77 percent. The ENT indicated the patient had increased shortness of breath in the morning. The patient 
continued to have stridor. Oxygenation included bilevel positive airways pressure/spontaneously timed (BiPAP/ST) 
mode, rate 15, IPAP 16, EPAP 8, PS 6, Fi02 45 percent, with blood gas (not specified arterial/venous), pH 7.38, 
PCO2 38, P02 74, HCO3 22.5, BE 2.5. Chest x-ray showed scattered atelectasis, elevated right hemidiaphragm. A 
physician indicated increased right hemidiaphragmatic paresis. BiPAP 16/8 via nasal mask was ordered to be 
discontinued and changed to 10L PM high flow nasal cannula (HFNC) at 45 percent, with home CPAP at night. 
Calcium carbonate (Ca 8.5) was ordered. A physician recommended to change to bolus feeds and frequent burping 
of stomach to decrease abdominal distension. Chest physical therapy every 6 hours was ordered. Fosphenytoin 
was decreased due to the mother being concerned about oversedation with seizure medications. Agitation had 
increased since starting Fosphenytoin and was ordered to be decreased and then the plan was to wean to off over 
2 days. A pharmacology/toxicology consult was obtained due to the patient going to the floor with Clonidine patch. 
On mom patient was transferred to the neurology floor. A physician indicated the patient continued to be 
agitated, diaphoretic with increased RR 21-42. On physical exam, the patient was hyperkinetic and had bilateral 
clonus of lower extremities (LE), as well as course breath sounds, The patient was stable on HFNC. HFNC 
decreased to 8 in PM and CPAP started that evening. HFNC was weaned off on this date. Decadron wean initiated 
and Claforan discontinued. A critical care physician indicated that the mother had noted a decrease in function 
described as the patient no longer able to ambulate and loss of his trunk control. In addition, the patient usually 
communicated using sign language and had lost that ability. He was no longer saying the few words he did know. 
He was no longer able to play with the iphone or on his ipad, The mother requested an acute inpatient rehabilitation 
assessment for these deficits. 
On 29/Jun/2013, the patient was treated for Benadryl for agitation overnight and that the mother stated she thought 
the patient was closer to baseline for mental status and had improvement of agitation. He continued to have course 
breath sounds and hypertonic LE on physical examination. 
On 30/Jun/2013, Fosphenytoin was discontinued after BID dosing. Decadron was discontinued and the Clonidine 
patch was decreased to 1/2 patch on Monday. The patient had no stridor. G-tube feeds were bolused during day

On U1110.0 a pulmonary staff consultant indicated the patient continued to have course breath sounds. 
bilateral rales, good aeration and weak cough and recommended cough in-exsufflator per home use and portable 
suction for home. 
On the mother indicated the patient had a mild tremor on the right and that he was favoring his right 
more than normal. The patient was transferred to rehabilitation unit and physical therapy (PT), occupational therapy 
(OT) and speech therapy (ST) were consulted to work on the decreased functionality of the patient. A pulmonary 
staff consultant indicated the patient was clinically improving and had good aeration bilaterally, with no crackles and 
rare rhonchi. 
A physician noted that the patient responded to aggressive vibration chest physical therapy and cough ex-sufflation. 
The patient had 3 seizures while in rehabilitation: however, none lasted greater than 5 minutes. He also had one 
episode of desaturation his first night in rehabilitation, which quickly resolved with 4 liters nasal cannula. An attempt 
to try P.O. feeds while he was an inpatient was made but he did not tolerate it well. The patient also had consult 
social work while an inpatient. 
On 1111.111.1111the patient was discharged to home. In addition to the patient having his insufflator and exsufflator 
machine for home use, a home pulse oximeter and oxygen was ordered for HS (to keep saturations greater than 92 
percent starting at 0 to 1 liter per minute of 02). The patient was to have a sleep study repeated in 6 to 8 weeks, if 
needed. The patient had ketones outside of the goal of 80 to 160, to be followed as an outpatient. The patient 
progressed well during rehabilitation and was able to get back to his functional baseline with ambulation, fine and 
gross motor control, balance, and trunk control and communication. He did have some right foot drop functionally 
and remained a little wobbly in standing and mobility. A right t-flexible absolute force online (AFO) orthotic was 
provided and a walker or gait trainer, if he did not continue to improve, would be considered. He will follow-up with 
ENT on 25/Ju1/2013 and ST on 14/Aug/2013 as an outpatient to determine his ability to take P.O. feeds, as he 
continued to be NPO at this time. He will follow-up with neurology on 16/Sep/2013 and the Developmental Clinic on 
07/Oct/2013. Follow-up with the Pulmonary clinic will be arranged as an outpatient. He was ordered to receive 120 
minutes per week of PT, OT and ST, which was his former frequency of attendance.
