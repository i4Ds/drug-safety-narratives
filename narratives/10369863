AER 1429133 is an interventional study case, received on 02/Jul/2014 from an oncologist and concerns a 66 year 
old female patient (patient number: 258671008) who experienced physical weakness, fever and suspected 
progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy while enrolled in study (b) (6)
(b) (6)
Medical history included a 5cm X 3cm large ulcerated basalion on the nose and the patient did not have a history of
immunodeficiency, chronic viral infections, bone marrow or solid bone transplant, herpes zoster, opportunistic 
infections, cytomegalovirus pneumocystic carinii pneumonia, known central nervous system (CNS) lupus or 
lymphoma and it was unknown if she had a history of herpes simplex infection. No complications of previous 
immunosuppressive and chemotherapy Concurrent conditions included basal cell carcinoma of right part of nose, 
left common femoral vein thrombosis, peripherally inserted central catheterization. Concomitant medications 
included enoxaparin sodium, pantoprazole, allopurinol, prednisolone acetate, ranitidine, clemastine, granisetron, 
lenograstim, addel N and cernevit. No past drugs were reported.
On 02/Apr/2014, the patient was diagnosed with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Excisional or Incisional 
biopsy of peripheral nymph node was performed with CD20 positive expression No brain MRI, biopsy and JC virus 
in cerebrospinal fluid was done. The informed consent of the patient was conducted on 07/Apr/2014 and was 
randomized in the Arm A of the study. On 08/Apr/2014, the patient started intravenous rituximab (IV) (visit 1)

injection at 668 mg (lot number: 1107135, frequency : every 3 weeks) once in cycle 1. On 09/Apr/2014, she started 
therapy with CHOP which included intravenous cyclophosphamide 1404 mg, intravenous doxorubicin 94 mg, 
intravenous vincristine 2 mg and oral prednisone 500 mg (form and frequency not reported). On 22/Apr/2014, she 
received subcutaneous rituximab (visit 2) 1400 mg (both actual total dose and dose intended).  On 07/May/2014, 
she received subcutaneous rituximab (visit 3) 1400 mg (both actual total dose and dose intended).  On 
21/May/2014, she received subcutaneous rituximab (visit 4) 1400 mg (both actual total dose and dose intended). 
On 22/May/2014, therapy with cyclophosphamide and doxorubicin was interrupted. On 02/Jun/2014, she was 
treated with oral dipyrone (Metamizol) 20 drops, every 8 hours and oral tramadol  20 drops, every 8 hours for pain 
because of oral mucositis. On the same day, she was also treated for oral mucositis with oral amphotericin B 1 mL, 
every 8 hours, oral benzydamine hydrochloride 15 mL, every 8 hours and oral lidocaine hydrochloride (lidocaine 
spray) 1 puff, as required.  On 11/Jun/2014, she received intravenous rituximab (visit 6) 668 mg (both actual total 
dose and dose intended).  On the same day, the treatment with dipyrone, tramadol, amphotericin B, benzydamine 
hydrochloride and lidocaine hydrochloride were stopped. On 12/Jun/2014, therapy with cyclophosphamide 1312mg 
and doxorubicin 87mg was restarted. On 13/Jun/2014, therapy with cyclophosphamide and doxorubicin was 
interrupted. On 01/Jul/2014, she came to the hospital for her rituximab dose and was later hospitalised as an 
inpatient due to the generalised physical weakness (grade 2). On 02/Jul/2014, she started treatment with 
intravenous electrolyte solution infusion 1000 ml daily, intravenous hyperalimentation 4.4% 1000 ml daily, 
intravenous electrolytes /trace elements 1 ampoule and intravenous vitamins 1 ampoule in response to the event. 
On the same day, she received intravenous rituximab (visit 7) 669 mg (both actual total dose and dose intended) 
which was most recent dose prior to fever. Weight control showed a further weight loss (in total from May/2014 till 
now about 10 kg), therefore parenteral nutrition was started and laboratory showed no clinical significant findings. 
On 03/Jul/2013, therapy with cyclophosphamide and doxorubicin was restarted. On 04/Jul/2014, therapy with 
cyclophosphamide, vincristine and doxorubicin was interrupted. On 07/Jul/2014, her leukocyte count was 6.37/NL 
(3.98 to 10.04), hemoglobin was 9.8 g/dl (11.2 to 15.7), platelet count was 338/NL (182 to 369) and therapy with 
prednisone was interrupted. After completion of 6 cycles of chemotherapy on (b) (6) , she developed grade2 
fever (about 39.2 degree celcius) which led to prolonged hospitalization. Same day, she was prescribed once 
intravenous gentamicin sulfate at 320 mg once a day, intravenous ceftriaxone at 2gm once a day, oral paracetamol 
at 500 mg as needed and intravenous piperacillin sodium/tazobactam sodium 4.5 g, every 8 hours and her blood 
culture aerobe and anaerobe was performed, after 5 days of incubation it showed negative. It was stated that in the 
last weeks, she had a cognitive decline and, psychiatric analysis showed a memory and concentration impairment 
with episodes of confusion. Clinically, it was rather an early demential syndrome (confirmed by psychiatricians) 
developed in the last few weeks. On (b) (6)  she developed  suspected progressive multifocal 
leukoencephalopathy (grade 1) and CT scan resulted a slight decrease of brain matter bi frontal and slight 
microangiopathic leukoencephalopathy periventricular. On 21/Jul/2014, she received intravenous rituximab (visit 8) 
625 mg (both actual total dose and dose intended). Leukoencephalopathy was a discreet suspicion in the computer
tomography in head. She was not able to look after herself and needed regular help in everyday life. On

23/Jul/2014, the events fever and physical weakness were resolved and the treatment with piperacillin 
sodium/tazobactam sodium was completed. She received treatment with oral sultamicillin 750 mg, every 12 hours. 
On 25/Jul/2014, treatment with sultamicillin was stopped. On 30/Jul/2014, suspected progressive multifocal 
leukoencephalopathy became serious and therapy with rituximab was permanently discontinued. On 04/Dec/2014, 
event suspected progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy was resolved.
The oncologist considered the event suspected progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy as medically significant
and probably related with rituximab (IV), rituximab (SC) and with protocol related procedure : chemotherapy 
(CHOP). The oncologist considered the event physical weakness as possibly related to rituximab (IV), rituximab 
(SC) and protocol related procedure : physical weakness after 6 cycles of chemotherapy. The oncologist 
considered the event fever as possibly related to rituximab (IV), rituximab (SC) and a protocol related procedure : 
fever about 39.2 degree celcius after 6 cycles of chemotherapy. The oncologist did not provide the causality of 
events physical weakness and fever with CHOP.
