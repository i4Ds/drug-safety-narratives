intravenously (IV), in combination with carboptatin, 6 AUC, IV, and bevacizumab, 15 mg/kg, IV, all every. days,

1114A 10. On days since last receiving the study therapy, the patient was hospitalized for falling and

reported he was -progressively weaker, unable to care for himself and had multiple falls since the previouas wmeek.. Study drug thilesPy was held beginning on1.110 A brain magnetic resonance image (h4Ril) done on
