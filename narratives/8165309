This investigator initiated trial , reported by a Study Investigator, concerns a 73 years old Caucasian 
female patient. The medical history of the patient included cough grade 1 since 15-Feb-2011, dyspnea grade 1 
since 15-May-2011 until 05-Sep-2011, and pulmonary artery thrombosis since 13-Jun-2011. Concomitant 
Medications included: dexamethasone, folic acid and cyanocobalamin, all as supplementation therapy, codeine 
phosphate for cough and enoxaparin sodium for pulmonary artery thrombus. On 12-Jul-2011, the patient received 
pemetrexed (Alimta) 710 mg, each days, intravenously, single agent, for the treatment of lung cancer. The last 
dose of study drugs prior the serious event was on 23-Aug-2011 (cycle 3). According to the investigator, the patient 
was being treated for pneumonia grade 2 since an unknown date, and since 06-Sep-2011 the patient was being_
treated for pneumonia grade 1 with moxifloxacin. On 06-Sep-2011 previous dyspnea increased to grade 2. On ip_  
the patient experienced dyspnea grade 3. Because of this event she was hospitalized on1.11111111151 
days after starting the study drugs treatment. The investigator stated that event of dyspnea was related with a 
lung cancer disease and not with pneumonia which was ongoing at the time of hospitalization. During 
hospitalization the patient received treatment with enoxaparin sodium due to her history of pulmonary artery

the patient died and the cause of death was reported as dyspnea (also reported as respiratory insufficiency, to be 
confirmed). No autopsy was performed. It was reported that there was no time to perform complementary exams to 
confirm pulmonary thromboembolism or disease progression, also it was not possible to perform imaging exams to 
evaluate the thrombosis evolution during hospitalization. The study investigator stated that the event dyspnea 
was not related to study drug and protocol procedures. It was stated that it was related to baseline disease lung 
cancer. Update on 03-Oct-2011. Per internal review on 03-Oct-2011. Changed as determined causality from Not 
reported to Yes. Update 18-Nov-2011: Additional information received on 17-Nov-2011 from site. Added a fourth 
reporter to the case. Added patient origin, weight and height. Added patient medical history. Changed start and stop 
dates of concomitant medications dexamethasone, folic acid and cyanocobalamin and some doses and 
frequencies. Added the concomitant medications codeine phosphate and enoxaparin sodium. Added dose, route 
and frequency of study drug. Changed start date of the serious event dyspnea and of hospitalization from NM 
aleto 6111110. Added grade of the event dyspnea. Added that patient was being treated for pneumonia 
grade 2 since an unknown date. Added the treatment enoxaparin sodium. Added that patient died and serious 
criteria of death to the event dyspnea. Added that no autopsy was performed and that there was no time to perform 
complementary exams to confirm pulmonary thromboembolism or disease progression. Added investigator 
relatedness opinion (changed from not reported to not related). Updated narrative and corresponding fields. 
Update 03-Feb-2012: Additional information received from initial reporter on 02-Feb-2012. Changed admission date 
tollIMM; added moxifloxacin as corrective treatment for pneumonia; added information that grade of 
pneumonia decreased to 1 on 06-Sep-2011; added information that event of dyspnea was not related with 
pneumonia which was ongoing at the time of hospitalization; added information that it was not possible to perform 
imaging exams to evaluate the thrombosis evolution during hospitalization. Updated narrative and correspondent 
fields.
