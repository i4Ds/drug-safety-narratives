Initial  a  ation for this interventional clinical case, AER 1083315, was received on 28/Jun/2012 from a physician 
and concerns a 64 Years old Male patient enrolled in an unspecified interventional clinical study. 
Past medical history included gastric cancer, emphysema, glaucoma, partial lung lobectomy (part of upper right 
lobe and whole lower right lobe) and partial lung lobectomy (parts of upper left lobe and lower left lobe). Concurrent 
conditions included cancer pain, dyspnea and COPD. Concomitant medications included paracetamol, vitamin a, 
tiotropium bromide, loxoprofen sodium, mecobalamin, granisetron hydrochloride and cyanocobalamin/folic acid. 
On 21/Nov/2011, the patient started treatment with bevacizumab at a dose of 15 mg/kg (route and frequency: not 
reported), intravenous pemetrexed at a dose of 500 mg/m2 and Carboplatin (dose, route, form and frequency: not 
reported). On 17/Mar/2012, the patient received the last dose of pemetrexed and bevacizumab. No significant bone 
marrow a sion or concurrent pneumonia had been noted since the chemotherapy was started. On the same 
day, CRP was 0.175 mg/dL, LDH 252 IU/L, WBC 5600/mm3AK5.ImEq/L, GRE 0,S8mg/dL, BUN13mg/dL, Na 141 
mEq/L, lib was 14.3g/dL and platelet count was 36.4x10E4/mm2. Onall.11111 he went to restroom in the mid 
night and when he went to the restroom again, he sat down and could not move from in front of the restroom, He 
was unc n on arrival of ambulance. According to the rescue worker, the patient had cardiopulmonary arrest. 
On   (at around 1 am), about months after start of pemetrexed, he developed cardiac arrest 
(reported as fife-threatening) and was urgently transported to another hospital. He was diagnosed with pneumonia 
(serious for fatal). No bone marrow suppression was noted. Inflammation findings showed almost negative. Head 
CT revealed no intracranial lesion. Chest CT confirmed infiltrative shadow mainly in the right lower lobe. Infiltrative 
was cons a  a to be caused by pneumonia. Tracheal intubation was performed and he was put under the 
artificial re , Spontaneous circulation resumed. Dopamine was administered to maintain the blood pressure. 
On ISOMMIPICRP was 0.84 rng/dILLDH was 592 tU/L, neutrophil was 65%, WBC was 5900/mm3, K 4.8mEq/L,

cardiopulmonary resuscitation and administration of medication at the time of emergency.) on: CRP 
was 15.64 mg/dl, LDH was 1316 IU/L, WBC was 11800/mm3, K5.ImEq/L, GRE 6.BSmg/d1, BUN was 214.4mg/d1,

Cause of death was acute pneumonia and cardiac arrest. The autopsy was not performed. It was reported that the 
patient did not a a bone marrow suppression and the patient was able to act without any problems on daily 
living while receiving chemotherapy as an outpatient, but emphysematous alternation appeared strongly in his lung. 
Because of that, he considered that the event was developed from cardiopulmonary arrest caused by acute

exacerbation of pulmonary emphysema due to complication of pneumonia which had developed during the course 
of treatment. The causality for protocol procedure was not provided. 
The reporter assessed the fatal event of cardiac arrest as related to concurrent disease of COPD and did not 
provide the causal relationship with bevacizumab, pemetrexed disodium and Carboplatin. 
The reporter assessed the fatal event of pneumonia as related to bevacizumab, pemetrexed disodium and 
Carboplatin.
