INITIAL INFORMATION FOR THIS CLINICAL CASE WAS RECEIVED ON 09 AUGUST 2011, FROM A 
PHYSICIAN AND CONCERNS A 84 YEARS OLD MALE PATIENT (PATIENT NUMBER:1MM WHO 
EXPERIENCED DYSPNEA WHILE ENROLLED IN LUN196: RANDOMIZED PHASE II TRIAL OF PEMETREXED 
VS. PEMETREXED/BEVACIZUMAB VS. PEMETREXED/CARBOPLATIN/BEVACIZUMAB IN PATIENTS WITH 
STAGE 111B/IV NON-SMALL-CELL LUNG CANCER AND ECOG PERFORMANCE STATUS 2. NO 
CONCURRENT CONDITIONS WERE REPORTED. A RELEVANT MEDICAL HISTORY INCLUDED 
HYPERTENSION, HYPOTHYROIDISM, ANXIETY AND CARDIAC ARRHYTHMIA. CONCOMITANT 
MEDICATIONS INCLUDED AMLODIPINE, DORZOLAMIDE/TIMOLOL, FUROSEMIDE AND LEVOTHYROXINE. 
NO PAST DRUGS WERE REPORTED. ON 01 DECEMBER 2010, THE PATIENT WAS DIAGNOSED WITH 
LUNG CANCER (MIDS TO BONE). ON 07 DECEMBER 2011, THE PATIENT STARTED WITH INTRAVENOUS 
BEVACIZUMAB 1071 MG EVERY THREE WEEKS AND INTRAVENOUS PEMETREXED 895 MG EVERY THREE 
WEEKS. ON 25 JULY 2011, THE THERAPY WITH BEVACIZUMAB AND PEMETREXED WAS STOPPED. ON 
05 AUGUST 2011, THE PATIENT REPORTED INCREASED SHORTNESS OF BREATH ALONG WITH 
BILATERAL LOWER EXTREMITY EDEMA WHICH WAS STABLE IN SIZE BUT HAD SOME BLISTERS AND HE 
PRESENTED WITH DYSPNEA GRADE 3.0N AN UNSPECIFIED DATE, THE PATIENT WAS HOSPITAISED. ON 
05 AUGUST 2011, LAB TEST WERE PERFORMED WHICH INCLUDED WHITE BLOOD CELL COUNT (RESULT 
1.6, NORMAL 4.2-10.8 UNIT), HEMOGLOBIN (9.8 UNIT, NORMAL VALUE 14-18 UNIT), PLATELET COUNT 
(RESULT 24 UNIT, NORMAL VALUE 130-450 UNIT), ABSOLUTE NEUTROPHIL COUNT (RESULT 1.12 UNIT, 
NORMAL VALUE 1.78-5.38), CREATININE (RESULT 1.6 UNIT, NORMAL VALUE 0.6-1.3 UNIT ) AND PRO BNP 
(RESULT 704 UNIT, NORMAL VALUE 0.450 UNIT). ON THE SAME DAY, THE PATIENT WAS MADE OFF THE 
STUDY DUE TO PROGRESSIVE ANEMIA AND RECEIVED PACKED RED BLOOD CELLS BUT THE PATIENT 
DID NOT FELT BETTER. ON THE SAME DAY, CHEST X-RAY REVEALED SMALL RIGHT PLEURAL EFFUSION 
AND QUESTIONABLE RIGHT BASTIAN INFILTRATE (RESULT NORMAL). ON 06 AUGUST 2011, CT OF 
CHEST AND ABDOMEN REVEALED DUODENITIS OR BILATERAL PLEURAL EFFUSION PERSTIALASIS 
(RESULT NORMAL), VENOUS DOPPLER (RESULT NEGATIVE) AND CTPEP PROTOCOL REVEALED NO 
PULMONARY EMBOLUS, LARGE INCREASED PERICARDIAL EFFUSION 1-8 CM (RESULT NORMAL). 
'CARDIOLOGIST WAS CONSULTED AND IT WAS REPORTED AS NO INTERVENTION INDICATED AT THAT 
TIME DUE TO THROMBOCYTOPENIA THEY DID NOT UNDERWENT WITH THE PLEURAL EFFUSIONS 
EITHER WOUND CARE AND DERMATOLOGY CONSULTED'. THE OUTCOME OF THE EVENT DYSPNEA 
WAS UNKNOWN. THERE WAS INSUFFICIENT INFORMATION REGARDING THE THERAPY STATUS WITH 
BEVACIZUMAB AND PEMETREXED. THE INVESTIGATOR ASSESSED THE EVENT DYSPNEA AS RELATED 
TO STUDY TREATMENT- BEVACIZUMAB AND PEMETREXED. NO FURTHER INFORMATION WAS 
PROVIDED. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION WAS RECEIVED ON 24 AUGUST 2011 PATIENT WEIGHT WAS 
UPDATED. CONCOMITANT MEDICATIONS INCLUDED FUROSEMIDE, LEVOTHYROXINE, TERAZOSIN, 
RAMIPRIL AND TIMOLOL. ON 05 AUGUST 2011, THE PATIENT DEVELOPED THE EVENT OF PLEURAL 
EFFUSIONS BILATERAL (GRADE 3). ON THE SAME DAY, THE PATIENT COMPLAINED INCREASED

SHORTNESS OF BREATH (DYSPNEA) AS WELL AS BILATERAL LOWER EXTREMITY EDEMA. ON THE 
SAME DAY, COMPUTER TOMOGRAPHY AND CHEST X-RAY SHOWED BILATERAL PLEURAL EFFUSION, 
PERICARDIAL EFFUSION AND CONGESTION. IT WAS REPORTED THAT LASIX DOSE WAS INCREASED, 
EJECTION FRACTION WAS NOT AFFECTED AND NO FURTHER CARDIAC INTERVENTION WAS 
REQUIRED. ON 08 AUGUST 2011, HIS WHITE BLOOD CELL COUNT WAS 4.7(NORMAL RANGE: 1.6, UNITS: 
NOT SPECIFIED), HEMOGLOBIN WAS 8.7 (NORMAL RANGE: 9.8, UNITS: NOT PROVIDED), PLATELET 
COUNT WAS 35 (NORMAL VALUE: 130-450, UNITS: NOT PROVIDED), CREATININE WAS 1.4 (NORMAL 
VALUE: 0.6-1.3, UNITS: NOT PROVIDED), PRO-BNP WAS 1591 (NORMAL RANGE: 0.450, UNITS NOT 
PROVIDED) AND CHEST X -RAY REVELED (RESULT: LESS CONGESTION PERSISTENT PLEURAL 
EFFUSION, BASELINE RESULT: NORMAL) . ON THE SAME DAY, HE WAS TAKEN OFF FROM THE STUDY 
DUE TO DECREASE IN HEMOGLOBIN. ON 15 AUGUST 2011, THE PATIENT WAS ACCOMPANIED BY HIS 
DOCTOR AS HE WAS ON OXYGEN IN HIS HOME DUE TO PERS ISTENT SHORTNESS OF BREATH. IT WAS 
REPORTED THAT, DYSPNEA WAS RELATED TO PLEURAL EFFUSION AND PERICARDIAL EFFUSION AND 
NOT TO HEART FAILURE. IT WAS ALSO REPORTED THAT, PATIENT ALSO DEVELOPED 
HYPOALBUMINEMIA WHICH WAS CONTRIBUTED TO THE FLUID RETENTION. ON AN UNSPECIFIED DATE, 
THE THERAPY WITH BEVACIZUMAB AND PEMETREXED WAS DISCOUNTINUED. ON AN UNSPECIFIED 
DATE, PLEURAL EFFUSIONS BILATERAL (GRADE 3) WAS RESOLVED WITH SEQUELAE. IT WAS 
REPORTED THAT SERIOUS BILATERAL PLEURAL EFFUSSION AND PERICARDIAL EFFUSION 
ASSOCIATED WITH DYSPNEA,BILATERAL LOWER EXTREMITY EDEMA COULD BE ASSOCIATED.THE 
THERAPY WITH BEVACIZUMAB WAS DISCOUNTINUED. IT WAS REPORTED THAT THE CAUSE OF 
DYSPNEA WAS PLEURAL EFFUSION AND ANEMIA THE PATIENT DOCTOR ATTRIBUTED SHORTNESS OF 
BREATH TO CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE AND POSSIBLY TO PEMETREXED AND 
BEVACIZUMAB. NO FURTHER INFORMATION WAS PROVIDED. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION WAS 
RECEIVED ON 02 SEPTEMBER 2011. PATIENTS CONCOMITANT MEDICATIONS INCLUDED FOLIC ACID 
AND HOMATROPINE METHYLBROMIDE/HYDROCODONE. THE EVENT OF BILATERAL PLEURAL EFFUSION 
WAS AMENDED FROM PLEURAL EFFUSION BILATERAL. ON 29 AUGUST 2011, PATIENT HEMOGLOBIN 
WAS 9 G/DL AND PLATELET COUNT WAS 106 X10"3/L (211 X10"3/L.). ON AN UNSPECIFIED DATE, THE 
PATIENTS EXPERIENCED PITTING EDEMA BILATERALLY IN UPPER AS WELL AS LOWER EXTREMITIES, 
PATIENTS OXYGEN LEVEL WAS INCREASED, SO THE PATIENT WAS CONTINUED WHEELCHAIR AND 
TREATMENT WITH FUROSEMIDE INCREASED. THE INVESTIGATOR ASSESSED THE EVENT OF 
BILATERAL PLEURAL EFFUSION (PREVIOUSLY REPORTED AS PLEURAL EFFUSIONS BILATERAL) AS 
RELATED CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE AND POSSIBLY TO PEMETREXED AND 
BEVACIZUMAB. NO FURTHER INFORMATION WAS AVAILABLE. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION WAS 
RECEIVED ON 22 SEPTEMBER 2011. THE HEIGHT OF THE PATIENT WAS UPDATED AS 65 INCHES, AND 
WEIGHT WAS UPDATED AS 170 LBS. THE RESULT BASELINE CT SCAN (CHEST) WAS NO PLEURAL 
EFFUSION, BASELINE PLATELET COUNT WAS 211 10E3/MICRO LITER, WHITE BLOOD CELL COUNT WA S
