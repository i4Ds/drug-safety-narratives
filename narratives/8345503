on 18JAN2012. Initial information for this literature summary study case, AER number 1030452, was received on 
09 January 2012 from other healthcare professional and concerns some patients (age range, 48-83) who 
dev one or more of the to ng events: Neutropenia, Leucopenia, Anemia, Pulmonary toxicity and Infection 
while being enrolled In a phase II study which was conducted to evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of Pemetrexed 
corn with Ertotinib or Gefininib after the relapse to Erlotinib or Gefitinib in patients with advanced NSCLC 
having an active epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation. Between February 2010 and April 2011, 27 
patients were enrolled: male/female 20/7, stage 111B/IV, 0/27; adeno/squamous carcinoma, 26/1. The median 
number of prior chemotherapy regimen was 2 (range, 0-6). Primary endpoint was disease control rate (DCR), and 
secondary endpoint was toxicities, response rate (RR), progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS). 
Patients received, Pemetrexed at a dose of 500 mg/m2 (Route, form, frequency: unknown) was administered on 
dayl, and Erlotinib or Gefininib (Route, dose, form, frequency: unknown) was sequentially administered on days 2-
16. This combination treatment was repeated every 3 weeks until disease progression. Grade 3/4 toxicities were 
Neutropenia, Leucopenia. and Anemia in 4 (18%), 3 (14%), 2 (9%) patients, respectively. Grade 3 Pulmonary 
toxicity and Infection were noted in 1 (5%) patient each. There was no treatment-related death. There was 
insufficient information regarding outcome of Neutropenia, Leucopenia, Anemia, Pulmonary toxicity and Infection as 
well as therapy  0 a'ng status of Erlotinib, Gefitinib and Pemetrexed. The authors reported that, Neutropenia, 
Leu Anemia, Pulmonary toxicity and Infection as toxicities of Erlotinib, Gefitinib and Pemetrexed. The 
Astellas m = a reviewer assessed grade 3/4 Neutropenia, Leucopenia, Anemia and garde 3 Pulmonary toxicity 
and Infection as o,.  By significant. Erlotinib given on days 2-16 every 3 weeks was considered inappropriate 
schedule of drug administration. Additional information has been requested. Okishio, K. Yoshimura, N. Kimura, T.
