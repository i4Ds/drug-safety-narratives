Medically Significant
A laboratory worker from (b) (6)  reported he received an unidentified CSF sample for JCV testing on 23 Jun 2014. 
Update 26 Jun 2014:During an outbound call for clarification, a neurologist reported via a Medical Science Liaison 
(MSL)  that a  patient on TYSABRI (300 mg, IV, QM) for an unknown indication from 21 Jan 2010  experienced 
suspect PML (onset unknown) based on an MRI result (results unknown) done on 26 Jun 2014.  The outcome for 
the event suspect PML is unknown. The causality for the event of suspect PML is unknown.  TYSABRI treatment is 
ongoing. The patient tested JCV positive on 23 Mar 2011 and JCV test on 15 Mar 2013 reported an index value 
was 3.18.

Update 02 Jul 2014: The MSL reported the (b) (6)  CSF sample result was negative.
Update 03 Jul 2014: The MSL reported on behalf of the neurologist that the (b) (6)  CSF assay was  repeated and 
although the second assay was negative the results were borderline. It was recommended the patient undergo 
another lumbar puncture and  a repeat MRI. A blood sample has also been requested. A suspicion of PML 
continues.
Update 10 Jul 2014:The MSL reported  the patient did in fact have two Lumbar puncture and both CSF samples 
were sent to (b) (6)  for testing.  Sample from the first LP performed on 23 Jul 2014 returned negative/ or 
inconclusive which prompted a second run of the assay, which again was inconclusive. A second LP performed on 
07 Jul 2014 was performed per (b) (6)  request; results were again inconclusive. Additionally a serum sample for JCV 
PCR returned positive at 83 copies/ ml from (b) (6) . The patient is described as asymptomatic and is to be treated
with PLEX and possibly Maraviroc.
Update 15 Jul 2014: Upon internal review of MRI scans 02 Jun 2014 (MRI: Findings consistent with Unilobar PML- 
left frontal lobe) and 09 Jul 2014( MRI: Impression: unilobar PML, left frontal lobe, no GD enhancement),  Biogen 
Idec considers this case to be high suspect for  PML. 
Update 16 Jul 2014:Per the MSL the patient is receiving the second plasmapheresis treatment today.
Update 17 Jul 2014:The MSL provided clarification. The initial sample of CSF collected and sent 23 June to (b) (6)
and analyzed 30 Jun was said to be negative but (b) (6)  had sufficient doubt to necessitate a re-analysis of the 
same sample on 01 Jul 2014. The results were said to be inconclusive .The (b) (6)  recommended that the patient 
have a second LP on 07 Jul 2014 due to a suspicion that the patient had PML but that the number of copies of virus
in the CSF was below their limit of detection. The second CSF sample also was not positive, yielding similar results 
to the first 2 assays. The analysis of the blood sample however showed 83 copies of virus/ml. A repeat MRI was 
ordered last week and upon seeing the results documenting a further evolution of the suspicious lesion, The 
physician decided to manage the patient as a  confirmed  case of PML and scheduled the PLEX to begin (3 
cycles) on Monday of this week(14 July). It was  requested that before the PLEX was initiated that another 60 ml of 
blood be drawn from the patient and sent to (b) (6)  The patient was seen by a physician yesterday. She is doing 
well, continues to be asymptomatic, and is tolerating the PLEX without any problems.
Update 08 Aug 2014: A study investigator confirmed that the 45 year old female patient was enrolled in the 
(b) (6)  and reported that the patient experienced PML (onset 02 Jun 
2014). The event was considered life-threatning and of mild intensity. Testing included an MRI on 02 Jun 2014 and 
lumbar puncture (LP) on 23 Jun 2014 (reported previously); no results provided. The patient received unspecified

treatment on 14 Jul 2014, 18 Jul 2014 and 08 Aug 2014 (presumed PLEX). The patient had not yet recovered from 
the event of suspect PML. Causality was assessed as related to TYSABRI. The most recent TYSABRI infusion 
prior to event was administered on 06 Jun 2014.
Update 26 Aug 2014: It was reported that the (b) (6)  CSF JCV result is pending (report requested). The patient is 
being referred to a neurosurgeon for a brain biopsy.
Update 04 Sep 2014: The  neurologist reported via the MSL that he had last heard the patient continues to do well. 
She believes the latest MRI (date unk) showed a further enlargement of her suspicious lesions, hence the 
recommendation for her to see a neurosurgeon for a brain biospy.
Update 05 Sep 2014:The nurse of the neurologist reported via the MSL that the patient was seen by another 
neurologist and he felt based on her most recent MRI that the patient does not have PML nor did he feel she had a 
tumor. The lesion has apparently  enlarged. He did not feel that a biopsy was indicated. The patient will be seen 
again by the primary neurologist.
Update 07 Oct 2014:  Additional information was provided by the Medical Science Liaison (MSL).  The patient is 
expected to have a biopsy next week. No further case information provided.
Update 15 Oct 2014:  Additional information was provided by the Medical Science Liaison (MSL).  The MRI's 
(unknown date) continue to show enlarging, suspicious lesion, however the patient remains asymptomatic. Per the 
MSL, the neurosurgeon said that based on the MRI he did not think it was a tumour but also doubted that it was 
PML.  The MSL also stated that at the time of the initial LP, the nurse of the neurologist did feel that the MRI was 
suspicious of PML.  The patient never developed clinically apparent IRIS.  The patient did undergo PLEX therapy, 
and at the time of this report the patient was not under any treatment.  The patient was referred for a brain biopsy 
"scheduled for this week".
Update 22 Oct 2014:  Additional information was received from the neurologist via the Medical Science Liaison 
(MSL).  The neurologist reported that the patient continued to be asymptomatic.  Presence of JCV in plasma 
samples was confirmed.  Results from the biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of PML and indicated some evidence of 
IRIS.  Causality for the IRIS was not assessed.  No further information provided.
Update 24 Oct 2014:  Additional information was received from the neurologist via the Medical Science Liaison 
(MSL).  The neurologist re-reported that the brain biopsy showed PML with IRIS.  The patient has been off 
TYSABRI since the end of Jun 2014.  Despite CSF samples yielding inconclusive/negative results (previously 
reported), the patient underwent 3 cycles of PLEX therapy.  The left frontal lesion continues to grow, and there is

evidence of another new lesion on the right side.  The patient remains asymptomatic aside from increased fatigue 
(presume symptom).  The neurologist was encouraged by another physician to start the patient on miraviroc 
(unknown if initiated), and for the patient to have frequent MRI's and pathology confirmed.  No further information 
provided.
Update 28 Oct 2014:  Pathology results from the brain biopsy were provided via the MSL.  Per the pathology report 
from 15 Oct 2014, marked changes at the level of the white matter are seen with presence of macrophages, large 
reactive astrocytes well demonstated with GFAP, oligodendrocytes containing nuclear inclusions which are positive 
for Polyoma, dense perivascular lymphocytic infiltrates and infiltrative inflammatory cells continuing numerous 
plasma cells.  The final diagnosis is IRIS associated with PML.
Update 30 Oct 2014:  Upon internal review, this is a confirmed case of PML based on radiologic findings and biopsy
results.
Update 09 Mar 2015: Additional information was received from the neurologist summarizing the clinical course. In 
Jun 2014, routine surveillance MRI noted a suspicious subcortical left frontal FLAIR lesion. The patient was 
asymptomatic. Repeat MRI showed progression in size. MRI on 02 Jun 2014 showed enlarging subcortical left 
frontal and later left temporal FLAIR nonenhancing lesions. CSF PCR for JCV was negative twice, testing 
completed two weeks apart. The patient continued to remain asymptomatic despite enlarging lesion on follow-up 
MRI.  Plasmapheresis was done three times followed by monthly SoluMedrol (methylprednisolone; IV). The lesion 
continued to grow without any enhancing component. Brain biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of PML with IRIS. The 
patient received IVIG (intravenous immune globulin). Follow-up MRI showed gradual reduction in the size of the 
now multiofocal lesion. The patient has remained asymptomatic throughout.
Update 09 Mar 2015: Additional information was received from a neurologist via a MS Standardized PML Data 
Collection Tool. Estimated Karnofsky scores were reported as follows: on an unspecified date prior to starting 
TYSABRI was 70 (cares for self; unable to carry on normal activity or to do active work); May 2014 while on 
TYSABRI prior to PML was 70; on 11 Jul 2014 at time of PML diagnosis was 70. Estimated EDSS scores were 
reported as follows: 4.0 on 16 Nov 2011; 3.5 on 09 May 2014; and 3.5 on 11 Jul 2014. The patient had a negative 
HIV result on 10 Nov 2009. The following relevant labs from 06 Jan 2010 (prior to starting TYSABRI) were reported:
leukocyte count 7.6 x10(9)/L (normal range 4-10 x10(9)/L); lymphocyte count 0.276; absolute lymphocyte count 2.1 
x10(9)/L (normal range 1-4 x10(9)/L); CD4 0.676 (normal range 0.350-0.580); CD8 0.154 (normal range 0.150-
0.330); CD4/CD8 ratio 4.38 (normal range 1.10-3.80). The patient was negative for anti-natalizumab antibodies on 
02 Jul 2010. The patient tested positive for anti-JCV antibodies on 15 Mar 2013. The following relevant labs from 17
Jan 2014 (on TYSABRI prior to PML) were reported: leukocyte count 9.5 x10(9)/L; lymphocyte count 0.351 percent;
absolute lymphocyte count 3.3 x10(9)/L. The following relevant labs from 14 Jul 2014 (pre-PLEX) were reported:

leukocyte count 10.5 x10(9)/L; lymphocyte count 0.399 percent; absolute lymphocyte count 4.2 x10(9)/L; 
monocytes 1.4 x10(9)/L (normal range 0.2-1.0 x10(9)/L). The patient has not been diagnosed with IRIS. No 
additional lumbar punctures have been performed. Currently, the patient is alive and residing at home. The 
outcome of the event of PML and causality to TYSABRI were not provided.
Update 15 May 2015: Additional information was received from the neurologist via a MS Standardized PML Data 
Collection Tool. The following relevant labs from 20 Jan 2015 were reported: leukocyte count 5.8 x10(9)/L; 
lymphocyte count % IN 0.263 ratio; absolute lymphocyte count 1.5 x10(9)/L.  The patient has not been diagnosed 
with IRIS (discrepant from previous report). The most recent brain MRI was done on 13 Mar 2015, MRI was stable 
with no lesions and no Gd+ lesions. On 15 May 2015, the estimated Karnofsky and EDSS scores were 70 (cares 
for self; unable to carry on normal activity or to do active work) and 3.0.  Currently, the patient is alive, residing at 
home, and is not currently on another therapy for MS. As of 15 May 2015, the event of PML is resolved. Causality 
for PML was assessed as related to TYSABRI.
Update 09 Nov 2015: Additional information was received from the neurologist via a MS Standardized PML Data 
Collection Tool. Currently, the patient is alive, residing at home, and is not on another therapy for MS. The patient s
estimated Karnofsky and EDSS scores on 18 Sep 2015, 12 months following PML diagnosis were reported to be 70
(cares for self; unable to carry on normal activity or to do active work), and 3.0. The most recent brain MRI was 
performed on 03 Sep 2015 which showed, in comparison to 13 Mar 2015, radiological stability as to the size, 
number and signal intensity of the multiple supra and infratentorial white matter lesions, with their distribution 
remaining compatible with the known MS diagnosis and severe lesion load. The left frontal PML area previously 
biopsied also remains comparable to previous examination findings. No new suspected PML site is found. It was 
reported that as of 07 Nov 2015 the patient has recovered from the PML, and causality for the PML was assessed 
as related to TYSABRI. The outcome of IRIS was not provided.
