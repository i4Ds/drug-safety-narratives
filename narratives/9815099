A study investigator reported that a 50 year old female subject receiving TYSABRl (300mg, IV, QM) from 13 Sep 
2007 to 18 Nov 2013 and enrolled in the (b) (6)
 came under suspicion for progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) on 18 Dec 2013.
Indication for TYSABRl is unknown.  The most recent infusion of TYSABRl prior to the event was administered on 
18 Nov 2013.  The patient had received an unknown number of infusions to date.  Past medical history included 
anxiety, spasticity, and pain.  Concomitant medications included Xanax (alprazolam), Symmetrel (amantadine), 
Neurontin (gabapentin), and Zantac (ranitidine).  Previous use of immunosuppressant/ immunomodulatory agents 
was not reported.
On 18 Dec 2013 the patient presented with paresis of the right arm, paresis of the right facial nerve, and 
paraparesis of hypoglossal nerve.  On 02 Jan 2014 the patient presented with paralysis of the right arm and 
expressive aphasia.  A brain MRI from 24 Dec 2013 showed a lesion in the left parietal lobe on T2.  A "CRF" 
sample was drawn on 02 Jan 2014 and sent for JCV DNA testing; results were pending at the time of this report.

FOIA Case Report Information
Treatment included 5 days of IV SoluMEDROL (methylprednisolone) starting on 18 Dec 2013, and oral Medrol 
(methylprednisolone) since 23 Dec 2013.
The investigator considered the event of "probable PML" related to TYSABRl.  TYSABRl therapy was temporarily 
discontinued.  At the time of this report the event was ongoing.
Update 08 Jan 2014:  The study investigator provided the following additional information.  The patient's 
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF, previously reported as "CRF") returned positive for JCV DNA at 298 copies/ mL 
(quantitative detection) from a local lab.
Update 13 Jan 2014:  The study investigator provided the following additional information.  The patient tested 
positive for anti-JCV antibodies on 29 Dec 2013 with an index value of 2.818, on 05 Jul 2013 with an index value of 
3.861, and on 18 Dec 2013 with an index value of 3.693.  The patient had no history of immunosuppressant use.  In
addition to the IV methylprednisolone the patient received in Dec 2013, she was on oral methylprednisolone at 
48mg per day for 3 days, tapered to 16 mg per day.
Update 10 Apr 2014:  Multiple follow up attempts were made for additional follow up information but to date, the 
neurologist had not provided any updates. Based on the available information that was previously provided, Biogen 
Idec considers this case confirmed for PML on 10 Apr 2014 based on clinical symptoms, positive CSF, and MRI 
description.
Update 17 Jul 2014: Additional information was received from the investigator via a MS Standardized PML Data 
Collection Tool. The following laboratory results were obtained on 12 Jun 2007 prior to starting TYSABRI: leukocyte
count 9800 K/microliter (normal range 4000 - 10000); lymphocyte count 24% (normal range 10 - 50%); absolute 
lymphocyte count 1000 K/microliter (normal range 1000-4000); CD4 923 K/microliter (normal range 722 - 1334); 
CD8 379 K/microliter (normal range 296 - 682); CD4/ CD8 ratio 2.43 (normal range 1.29 - 2.55).  The following 
laboratory results were obtained on an unspecified date while on TYSABRI and prior to PML: leukocyte count 
11600 K/microliter; lymphocyte count 36%; absolute lymphocyte count 4210 K/microliter.  An MRI was performed 
prior to PML diagnosis on 16 Sep 2010, and at the time of PML diagnosis on 23 Dec 2013 (results not reported).
The patient had a positive anti-JCV antibody result on the following dates: 25 Oct 2011, 21 Nov 2012 (index 2.818), 
26 Jun 2013 (index 3.861), and on 18 Dec 2013 (index 3.693).  The investigator assessed the patient?s estimated 
Karnofsky and EDSS scores as follows: 70 (cares for self; unable to carry on normal activity or to do active work) 
and 6 on 13 Sep 2007; 60 (requires occasional assistance, but is able to care for most of her personal needs) and 
6.5 on 13 Oct 2013; and 30 (severely disabled; hospital admission is indicated although death not imminent) and 
7.5 on 18 Dec 2013.  Currently, the patient is alive, residing at home, and has recovered from PML. Causality for 
the event was assessed as related to TYSABRI.

FOIA Case Report Information
Update 01 Oct 2014: Additional information was received from a physician including MRI reports. A brain MRI on 20
Sep 2010 indicated multiple foci of varying sizes in the periventricular and subcortical white matter in both cerebral
hemispheres, which are attributed to the known demyelinating disease; enlargement of the external subarachnoid 
space, mainly in the frontal and high in the parietal area; the rest of the examination of the brain did not reveal any 
abnormalities. A brain MRI on 23 Dec 2013 indicated the following: In the white matter, the hemispheres, around 
the lateral ventricles, multiple regions were identified, some of which were sizeable with very high signal intensity in 
the T2 sequences, while most of which were not shown in the T1 sequences; many of the regions were identified 
distally, as well as in the corpus callosum; it was speculated the existence of small regions in the pons, at the 
boundaries with the cerebral peduncles, both to the right and left of the midline; suspected a small region in the 
right cerebellar peduncle. In the left parietal area, immediately below the posterior central gyrus and extending to 
the superficial white matter, a region was identified with increased signal intensity in the T2 and low signal intensity 
in the T1 sequences, in which we cannot exclude the coexistence of a vascular lesion corresponding to the above 
point. No foci of abnormal signal enhancement noted in the levels of the described lesions after intravenous 
administration of the paramagnetic substance. We note associated signs of relative atrophy of the brain 
parenchyma with a relative expansion of the subarachnoid space and the ventricular system, which is symmetrical.
A lumbar spine MRI on 23 Dec 2013 indicated the following: within the spinal cord, in the posterior surface, behind 
the level of C3/C4, a corresponding lesion was identified, such as those described in the cerebral parenchyma, 
mainly in the left of the midline, with elongated morphology. A similar region seemed to be identified respectively to 
the level behind the upper edge of the midline and vertebra T3. No foci of abnormal signal enhancement noted in 
the above regions after intravenous administration of the paramagnetic substance.
Update 03 Dec 2014: A healthcare professional spontaneously reported that the patient was at home bedridden, 
not communicating with the environment. No other information was provided.
Update 04 Dec 2014: Additional information was received from a physician via a Standardized PML Data Collection
Tool. The patient is alive, residing at home, and is not currently on any MS therapy. The patient's estimated 
Karnofsky and EDSS scores on 17 Nov 2014 were 40 (disabled; requires special care and assistance) and 9.5, 
respectively. The patient has not been diagnosed with IRIS. At the time of the report, the patient had not recovered 
from PML. Causality for the event was assessed as related to TYSABRI.
Update 21 Apr 2015: Additional information was received from a physician via a Standardized MS PML Data 
Collection Tool. The patient is alive, residing at home, and is not currently on another therapy for MS. On 21 Apr 
2015, the physician assessed the patient's estimated Karnofsky and EDSS scores to be 40 (disabled; requires 
special care and assistance) and 9.5, respectively. The patient is not currently on another therapy for Multiple 
Sclerosis. At the time of this report, the patient has not recovered from PML. Causality for the event was assessed 
as related to TYSABRI.
