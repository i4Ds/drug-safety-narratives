A neurologist spontaneously reported that an adult male patient on TYSABRI (unknown dose, IV, unknown 
frequency) for Multiple Sclerosis from unknown date to unknown date was hospitalized from an unknown date to an
unknown date for PML suspicion (onset unknown). The patient was currently hospitalized at the time of this report. 
A CSF sample was sent for JCV DNA testing and the result is pending. The event of PML suspicion is ongoing. The
causality for the event of PML suspicion is unknown.  It is unknown if TYSABRI treatment is ongoing.
Update 27 Sep 2014: Additional information was provided by the neurologist. The patient experienced his first 
episode of optic neuritis retrobulbar in 2001 and his second one in 2009. Devic's disease had been excluded and 
he was treated with TYSABRI (300 mg, IV, QM) from Mar 2009 to May 2012. In May 2012, his EDSS was 6. He 
experienced prescribed underdose described as TYSABRI therapy was scheduled for every 45 days from May 
2012 to Jul 2014. TYSABRI was discontinued in Jul 2014 and the patient was treated with cortisone monthly. On an
unknown date, the patient was referred to hospital due to unstability, dizziness and impaired cognitive function 
(presumed as symptoms of PML suspicion). The patient was transferred to another hospital and received 
plasmapheresis due to PML suspicion following MRI done on an unknown date. On 25 Sep 2014, upon his clinical 
examination, the patient presented somnolence, disorientation in space and time, inability to execute complex 
orders, mild impairment of the muscular strength at the lower limbs. He was standing upright with difficulties and 
needed assistance for walking. Additional symptoms included hypoesthesia of the right limb and presents 
increased tendon reflexes at the lower limbs, especially right sided diffused. No further information was provided.
Update 01 Oct 2014: The result of CSF JCV DNA testing was received. The test performed on 01 Oct 2014 had 
ambiguous results (not specified). No further information was provided.
Update 03 Oct 2014: A healthcare provider reported via a PML data collection tool that the patient is currently 
hospitalized.  The patient was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis on 27 Jun 2009.  Previous immunomodulatory 
therapy included AVONEX for one dose.  On 04 Jul 2012 a MRI was preferred prior to the PML diagnosis with 
results not reported.   On 25 Sep 2014 a MRI was performed at the time of the suspected PML diagnosis with 
results not reported.  The patient tested positive for anti-JCV antibodies on 08 Mar 2012 and positive on 26 Jun 
2014 with an index value of 3,304.  No brain biopsy has been performed. MS symptoms prior to suspect PML 
included motor changes in the form of walking disturbances requiring the need of support to walk with an EDSS of 
6.  The patient also experienced visual changes in the form of visual acuity, more specifically the patient was blind 
in the right eye and "finger counting" in the left eye in 2008. The patient was evaluated for PML based on signs and 
symptoms that resulted in an MRI which revealed suspicious findings. The signs and symptoms included cognitive

and behavior changes in the form of cognitive decline on 05 Sep 2014.  Motor changes presented as worsening of 
walking and standing on 01 Sep 2014.  A lumbar puncture was performed on (b) (6)  and CSF samples 
tested on 01 Oct 2014 with inconclusive results.  At the time of PML suspicion and pre-PLEX the patient tested on 
(b) (6)  with a leukocyte count 6.00 10x3/mcL (reference range: 4 - 10 10x3/mcL) and Absolute Lymphocyte 
Count 25 Sep 2014 0.70 x 10x3mcL (reference range: 1.2 - 3.4 x 10x3/mcL).  A CSF analysis was abnormal on (b)(6)  
(b) (6)  with total protein of 55mg/dL (reference range: 15 - 45 mg/dL).  Treatment included PLEX on (b) (6)  
(b) (6)  2900mL, (b) (6)  2900mL, and (b) (6)  2900mL, with 3 sessions completed and 6 total.  The patient
was treated with mefloquine 500mg p.os. 1x1/week from 26 Sep 2014, Mirtazapine 30mg p. os.  1x1 from 26 Sep 
2014, corticosteroids 1000mg IV 1x1 25 Sep 2014 to 05 Oct 2014, and ranitidine 150mg IV 1x1 from 26 Sep 2014.
The patient started on TYSABRI in Jul 2009 to 02 Aug 2014 (dates discrepant from previous report).  It was noted 
that the patient took 300mg IV every 4 weeks from Jul 2009 to 28 May [illegible] and 300mg IV every 45 days from 
May 2012 to 02 Aug (illegible, presumed 2014). The patient has not experienced an interruption of the suspect 
product for greater than 3 months.  PML is still under investigation. 
Update 09 Oct 2014: The neurologist reported that the patient has been experiencing the following symptoms: 
instability, dizziness, impaired cognitive function, somnolence, disorientation in space and time, inability to execute 
complex orders, mild impairment of the muscular strength at the lower limbs, hypoaesthesia of the right lower limb, 
and increased tendon reflexes at the lower limbs.  Medical history included the patient experienced the first episode
of optic neurits retrobulbar in 2001, the second episode of optic neuritis retrobulbar in 2009 and Devic's disease 
was excluded. On 01 Oct 2014 the patient's JCV DNA testing was ambiguous (previously reported).  On 04 Jul 
2012 a brain MRI showed no significant change in the findings compared with the previous examination, of 05 Oct 
2011. On(b) (6)  a brain MRI showed T1W, T2W, PDW, FLAIR, FFE sequences performed in the transverse,
sagittal and coronary planes, before and after the IV administration of a contrast agent. The results showed multiple
confluent foci with signal abnormalities and diffusely pathological display of the deep and subcortical white matter of
the cerebral hemispheres, mainly in the frontoparietal area bilaterally but more extensively in the right cerebral 
hemisphere. Foci of a lesion are also noted in the genu and the splenium of the corpus callosum, the stem, the 
medulla oblongata and in the left middle cerebellar peduncle. After the IV administration of a contrast medium, we 
note multiple punctuate foci of uptake thereof, and in some areas larger foci of uptake, mainly in the right cerebral 
hemisphere. A punctuate uptake is also noted in the foci in the corpus callosum, the stem, the medulla oblongata 
and in the left middle cerebellar peduncle. Despite the non-typical haemodynamic behavior of the lesions, this 
appearance could be attributed to progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML).  A brain MRI on (b) (6)
showed The control conducted before and after the intravenous administration of a paramagnetic contrast agent, 
and in comparison with the previous MRI of 25 Sep 2014, revealed the following: the patient's extensive lesions 
were checked due to a demyelinating disease, which extend throughout the right cerebral hemisphere, more 
confluent and covering a greater area than in the previous examination, while we also rechecked the lesion in the

white matter of the left lobe, more delineated than in the previous examination, where we observed a confluent 
form. The demyelinating lesions were rechecked in the medulla oblongata on the right, in the central and right area 
of the pons, while the foci in the left lower cerebellar peduncle and the right cerebellum, in the subcortical pars, are 
imaged fainter today.  It was noted that a demyelinating focus in the white matter of the left cerebellum, lesions in 
the genu and the splenium of the corpus callosum, as well as smaller ones in the periventricular and 
supraventricular areas.  After the intravenous administration of the paramagnetic agent, the punctuate 
enhancement was not noted that was noted in the prior examination, while one focus that exhibited annular uptake 
of the contrast agent is not imaged punctuate today.  A further clinical assessment is recommended because of the
imaging findings of PML. TYSABRI has been discontinued.
Update 10 Oct 2014: The results for second the JCV DNA detection test were received. The test was performed on
10 Oct 2014 and patient was found marginally positive, <50 copies. The patient, following 5 PLEX cycles, was 
discharged (b) (6)  from the hospital. He is ambulatory and his overall status is considered good.  No 
additional information was reported.
Update 23 Oct 2014:  Upon internal review this case was confirmed for PML based on positive CSF, positive MRI, 
and clinical symptoms.
Update 05 Nov 2014: A doctor from the local lab reported that the patient's first CSF sample from 26 Sept 2014 had
one run that was negative and the other run gave low positivity. A second CSF sample was collected on (b) (6)  
(b) (6)  (previously reported as 10 Oct 2014) and tested positive but fell outside the standard curve; therefore, the 
result was given as "marginally positive".
Update 22 Jan 2015: The investigator reported that the patient's imaging status has improved.  No further 
information was reported.
Update 05 Feb 2015: Additional information was received from a physician via a MS Standardized PML Data 
Collection Tool and diagnostic report. The patient was negative for HIV (date of test not reported). The patient was 
positive for serum anti-JCV antibodies on 08 Mar 2012 and on 26 Jun 2014 (index 3.304). A brain MRI was 
performed on 04 Jul 2014 (results not provided). Estimated Karnofsky and EDSS scores were reported as follows: 
EDSS of 6 on 28 May 2012; unspecified date Karnofsky score of 80 (normal activity with effort; some signs or 
symptoms of disease); 10 Sep 2014 score of 60 (requires occasional assistance, but is able to care for most of his 
personal needs); (b) (6)  score of 50 (requires considerable assistance and frequent medical care). A brain 
MRI was performed on(b) (6)  (previously reported). On this same date, the patient's leukocyte count was 6 x
10(3)/microliter (normal range 4 - 10 x10(3)/microliter) and absolute lymphocyte count was 0.70 x 10(3)/microliter 
(normal range 1.2 - 3.4 x10(3)/microliter). A brain MRI was performed on 14 Jan 2015 with results reported as

follows: Multiple foci of abnormal magnetic signal diffused in the deep white matter, in the subcortical area of the 
frontal, parietal and temporal helices, pons, mid cerebellar part on the left, genu and splenium of the corpus 
callosum are imaged. Some of the lesions were of confluent character in terms of the deep white matter of the right
cerebral hemisphere where a diffused magnetic signal of abnormal intensity is observed. Abnormal intake of 
contrast of mainly micro-nodular morphology is imaged following the intravenous administration of contrast, while 
one of the lesions, located in the subcortex of the mid frontal helix on the right, shows annular contrast intake. The 
above imaging findings could be attributed, on the one hand to the presence of demyelinating foci and, on the 
other, to inflammatory elements - PML - correlation to the rest of the clinical-laboratory investigation. Compared to 
the previous MRI of 12 Nov 2014, a differentiation of the imaging findings is observed given that in this test: a) the 
micro-nodular contrast intakes are fewer in number; b) are characterized by milder contrast intake; c) at some 
places leptomeningeal intake is marked at Sylvius fissures; d) no differentiation is observed in terms of the extent of
the abnormal magnetic signal in the deep white matter of the right cerebral hemisphere extending to the paracentral
lobule. Normal dimensions and morphology are imaged in the ventricular brain system. Normal imaging of the optic 
chiasm of the supersellar cistern and cavernous sinuses. No additional lumbar punctures have been performed. 
Currently, the patient is alive and is residing at home. The patient has not recovered from PML as of 04 Feb 2015. 
Causality for the event of PML was assessed as related to TYSABRI.
