This Clinical Trial 4111111111111111case, reported by a Study Investigator, concerns a 63 Years old Black Male 
patient. Medical History: Non-small cell lung cancer metastatic , Hypertension , Dyslipidaemia , Benign prostatic 
hyperplasia. Concomitant Medication(s): folic acid for prophylaxis , cyanocobalamin for prophylaxis , tamsulosin 
hydrochloride , prochlorperazine for severe nausea and vomiting , promethazine hydrochloride for nausea and 
vomiting , lorazepam , sertraline hydrochloride , megestrol acetate , ondansetron hydrochloride for nausea , 
atenolol , lisinopril , hydrochlorothiazide , nutrients nos , tadalafil for erectile dysfunction , vitamins nos , vardenafil 
hydrochloride , potassium chloride The patient was started on pemetrexed 500 mg/m2 intravenous (IV) every 21 
days on 21-DEC-2010 and carboplatin 6 AUC IV every 21 days on 21-DEC-2010. The last dose of carboplatin prior 
to the event 21-FEB-2011 and this was also the last dose of carboplantin which successfully completed the 4th 
cycle, and the patient was put on the maintenance dose of caroplantin. The patient began the maintenance therapy 
with pemetrexed 500 mg/m2 IV on 14-MAR-2011and the last dose of emetrexed prior to the event was 28-APR- 
2011. The patient was just discharged from the hospital on due to an episode of bradycardia. The 
patient had been hospitalized for less than 24 hours. Upon discharge the patient's atenolol (was reduced from 100 
mg to 50 mg) and lisinopril doses were cut in half, since the cause of the bradycardia was thought to be due to his 
current medication doses. On the patient was at home with complaints of chest pain and dizziness 
after eating dinner. The patient stated the episode felt like indigestion, and the chest pain did go away after an 
episode of vomiting. The wife took the patient to the rescue station close to their house where his heart rate was 
found to be in the 150s. Emergency medical services (EMS) transported the patient to the emergency room (ER), 
upon examination the patient's heart rate was in the 120s via telemetry showing sinus tachycardia. His blood 
pressure was 80/61. IV fluids (2 liters) were administered with a good response with his heart rate and blood 
pressure. The first set of cardiac troponins were negative. An electrocardiogram (EKG) showed sinus tachycardia 
and no signs of infarction and the patient had no known cardiac history. There was no recurrence of chest pain 
upon admission through the ER. Chest x-ray showed possible enlargement of hilar mass. The patient was admitted 
to general medicine for continuation of IV fluids and two more CK, CK-MB and troponin level checks. The SAEs 
were as follows: dehydration grade 3, dizziness grade 2, chest pain grade 1, hypotension grade 2. 0n
no el. his laboratory tests were as follows: calcium 7,1 mg/dL, total CK 40 u/L, CK-MB 1.8 ng/mL, potassium 2.9 
mmol/L, hematocrit 27.0%, an EKG showed abnormal T, consider ischemia (changes consistant with lateral 
ischemia) and a chest computed tomography test showed left lower lob (LLL) mass and nodules. On MEM 
the patient underwent a myocardial perfusion study (cardiac stress test) which was normal with an ejection fraction 
(EF) of 51% (normal >45%) and no ischemia. According to the admitting note, due to his response to the IV fluids, 
this suggested a strong component of dehydration and hypotension. The patient could possibly discharged within 
24 hours if CK total, CKMB, and troponin levels remain negative and there was no recurrent chest pain. The patient 
was ruled out for an acute coronary syndrome with a total of 6 sets of cardiac enzymes which were performed and 
all were normal and it was considered that the most likely cause of chest pain was being attributed to a known left 
NSCLA and that the dizziness and hypotension were considered as symptoms of dehydration. The patient was 
followed on telemetry through the hospital stay and no further cardiac events were noted. It was reported that on

FOIA Case Report Information 
4111111111111, the patient had recovered from the events of dehydration-CTC grade 3, dizziness-CTC grade 2, 
chest pain-CTC grade 1, and hypotension-CTC grade 2. On 011.1.111111, the patient was discharged from the 
hospital. The study investigator considered dehydration grade 3 was related to pemetrexed because dehydration 
is a noted side effect of pemetrexed. The investigator felt that dizziness grade 2 was related to pemetrexed and it 
was possibly a result of the patient's dehydration brought on by pemetrexed. The investigator felt that chest pain 
grade 1 was possibly related to the patient's dehydration state which was possibly caused by pemetrexed. The 
investigator felt that hypotension grade 2 was possibly a symptom of the patient's dehydration state brought on by 
the pemetrexed. The investigator considered the events to not be related to carboplatin and not related to protocol 
procedure. This case is connected to cases US201105000078 and US201101001334. Update 05-MAY-2011: 
Additional information received 04-MAY-2011 from the investigator: updated the event outcomes for all events, 
concomitant medication information was updated, diagnostic tests were added, hospital discharge date was added,
