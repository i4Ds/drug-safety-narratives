progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy.  American Journal of Neuroradiology; 27 Aug 2015.  doi: 
10.3174/ajnr.A4436.  This case is in reference to patient number 5, a 49 year old female patient.  The patient was 
on TYSABRI from an unknown date to an unknown date for relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis for a total of 60 
months of exposure.  On an unknown date the patient's cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) tested positive for JCV DNA.  The
patient had 4 brain MRIs available (dates and results not reported) from the "pre-symptomatic to chronic stage".
The patient did not have susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI).  The patient did have T2 weighted imaging.  The 
PML lesions were located in the left temporal, lesions were not adjacent to basal ganglia.  There was low signal 
intensity within the U-fibers.  There was not low signal in the deep gray matter.  At the time of detection of the 
susceptibility-weighted signal abnormality the patient's stage was reported as "chronic".  The authors assessed
