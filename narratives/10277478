Medically Significant
A neurologist spontaneously reported that a female patient (age unknown) on TYSABRI (300 mg, IV, QM) for an 
unknown indication since unknown date experienced PML suspicion (onset 09 May 2014).  The patient is JCV 
antibody positive with prior IS [immunosuppressant] use who developed a suspected MRI lesion. LP will be 
performed and samples will be sent to (b) (6)  for testing. No treatment was reported for the event. The outcome for 
the event PML suspicion is unknown. The causality for the event of PML suspicion is unknown.  TYSABRI therapy 
continues.
Update 19 and 20 May 2014:   A physician spontaneously reported via a Biogen Idec Employee (Medical Liaison 
Manager) that the patient was 44 years old when PML was suspected.  Previous MS therapies included the 
following: Avonex was started in 2000 and continued for 17 months and then stopped due to poor tolerability, 
Copaxone (glatiramer) was started in 2002 and continued for 7 months, and azathioprine for several months.  The 
patient did not receive MS treatment between 2003 and beginning of 2009. TYSABRI was started in Jan 2009 and 
stopped in Jun 2011 due to the patient trying to get pregnant. The patient started betaferon from Jun 2011 to Aug 
2011 when it was stopped due to poor tolerability. In Sep 2011, the patient experienced a relapse (presume MS) 
and TYSABRI was re-started in Oct 2011.  First and last doses of TYSABRI were noted as Jan 2009 to May 2011 
and 11 Oct 2011 to 29 Apr 2014.   The patient has no clinical symptoms.  The patient tested positive for JCV 
antibody on an unknown date and had an EDSS of 5 on TYSABRI.  A MRI on 07 May 2014 showed a new left 
frontal lesion, which was also confirmed by a safety reading by ((b) (6)  Medical 
Center (b) (6)   A lumbar puncture was performed on 12 May 2014 and the result of the CSF for JCV 
DNA was negative from (b) (6)  testing.  Another 2 CSF samples were sent to (b) (6)  for testing on 20 May 2014; 
results pending. No further information was provided.
Update 21 May 2014:  Follow-up was received from the physician via a Biogen Idec Employee (Medical Liaison 
Manager). The physician clarified that the 2 samples sent to (b) (6)  were from the same lumbar puncture performed 
on 12 May 2014. If the result from (b) (6)  is negative also, the physician will do a new lumbar puncture.
Update 26 May 2014: Follow-up was received from the physician via a Biogen Idec Employee (Medical Science 
Manager).  The physician reported that the (b) (6)  result was negative also.  A MRI is planned and a new PL 
(presume lumbar puncture) will be performed the same day.  The CSF will be sent to (b) (6)  and also to the 
(b) (6)  lab for testing.
Update 04 Jun 2014: Follow-up was received from the physician via a Biogen Idec Employee (Medical Science 
Manager).  It was clarified that a second lumbar puncture was performed on 28 May 2014.  The samples were sent 
to (b) (6)  and to (b) (6)  results were negative from both labs.  The first lumbar puncture was done on 12 May 
2014; the CSF samples were negative from (b) (6)  and (b) (6)  A MRI done last week was sent to the (b) (6)  The

physician again confirmed the suspect lesion. Based on the results of the next MRI scheduled on 20 Jun 2014 and 
if clinical symptoms will appear, the physician will be advised to perform a third lumbar puncture.  According to the 
physician, the patient is still asymptomatic at the time of this report.
Update 20 Jun 2014: Follow-up was received from the physician via a Biogen Idec Employee (Medical Science 
Manager).  The physician reported that an MRI performed on 20 Jun 2014 showed little enhancement of the lesion. 
Clinical examination was normal and the patient is doing well.  A new PL (presume lumbar puncture) will be 
performed the next week as well as testing for anti-natalizumab antibodies.
Update 04 Jul 2014: The neurologist spontaneously reported via a Biogen Idec Employee (Medical Science Liaison)
that CSF JCV PCR results from (b) (6)  was positive at 35 copies/ml (consistent with variant most commonly 
associated with PML). The collection date of this CSF sample was confirmed to be 23 Jun 2014.  Next MRI is 
planned on 14 Jul 2014.
Update 10 Jul 2014: Upon internal review, this case is confirmed for PML based on positive CSF and radiologic 
evidence for PML.
Update 16 Sep 2014: Follow-up was received from the treating physician via a Biogen Idec Employee (Medical 
Science Liaison).  The treating physician reported that the patient is doing well. The last MRI done in Aug 2014 
showed a PML lesion with a small Gd enhancement and stable MS lesions.   The next MRI will be performed on 22 
Sep 2014.
