Medically Significant
A neurologist spontaneously reported that a female patient on TYSABRI (unknown dose, IV, unknown frequency) 
for Multiple Sclerosis from unknown date to 20 Dec 2014 was hospitalized from (b) (6)  to an unknown date 
for PML suspicion (onset unknown). The patient has been on TYSABRI for 5 years and is JCV antibody positive.
The last infusion of TYSABRI was on 20 Dec 2014, after which the patient began to present dysarthria, identified on
13 Jan 2015, when the patient returned to the hospital for a new infusion. TYSBARI was suspended.  On 13 Jan 
2015, the patient underwent MRI which showed new lesion which characterisitcs compatible with PML without 
contrast enhancement (previous MRI was done in April).  Lumbar puncture on 13 Jan 2015, analysis performed in 
the hospital laboratory, was negative.  Since the MRI result was compatible with PML, the reliability of the CSF 
analysis result was not guaranteed, and the patient had been presenting this clinical profile for 4 weeks, the 
physician decided to hospitalize the patient on (b) (6)  to perform plasmapheresis. CSF sample is scheduled

to be forwarded to (b) (6)  to confirm the result.  The event of PML suspicion is ongoing. The causality for the event
of PML suspicion is unknown.  TYSABRI therapy was discontinued.
Update 21 Jan 2015: Follow-up information was received from the treating physician.  Index (JCV antibody) was 
3.3-3.4 (MD unable to provide previse value).  The patient underwent the first session of PLEX (plasma exchange) 
yesterday and is well.  No further information was available.
Update 28 Jan 2015: Follow-up information was received from the treating neurologist.  CSF JCV DNA testing by 
(b) (6)  was positive with 33 copies/ml.  The patient has undergone three sessions of PLEX and is stable.
Update 29 Jan 2015: Follow-up information received indicated the patient has already done 3 PLEX sessions and 
serum was collected after the sessions.  The physician would like to do natalizumab dosing and/or alpha-4-integrins
dosing (NOS; presume antibody testing).
Update 02 Feb 2015:  Follow-up information was received from the neurologist via a Biogen Idec Employee. The 
patient had not started corticosteroids yet, but was stable.  A new MRI was planned later this week.  MRI images 
will be provided on 06 Feb 2015.  Additionally, the neurologist provided the following information via a MS PML 
Data Collection Form: Suspect.  Patient's date of birth was provided.  The 33 year old patient started TYSABRI 
(300mg, IV, QM) on 30 Sep 2009 and discontinued on 13 Jan 2015 (therapy was not interrupted for greater than 3 
months); the patient's last dose was administered on 16 Dec 2014 (date discrepant).  The patient is currently at 
home. The patient was diagnosed with MS on 06 Feb 2001. MS disease symptoms prior to suspected PML 
included bilateral Babinski sign (motor, focal) and right sided numbness (sensory, focal) (onsets prior to Aug 2013). 
The patient has not received any prior immunosuppressant therapy; however, immunomodulatory therapy included 
Rebif (interferon beta-1a) 44ug SC three times a week for MS from 06 Feb 2001 to 14 Aug 2009. Signs and 
symptoms which led to the evaluation for possible PML included blurred speech/word finding difficulty (speech) 
(onset 25 Dec 2014).  A MRI at the time of suspected PML diagnosis was performed on 13 Jan 2015 (results 
previously provided) and a MRI prior to suspected PML diagnosis was performed on 09 Apr 2014 with results 
suggestive of demyelinating disease, being entirely overlapping to the changes observed in a MRI performed on 05 
Aug 2013 with no suggestive images of PML.  A lumbar puncture was performed on 13 Jan 2015.  CSF sample 
tested on 13 Jan 2015 at a local lab showed negative CSF JCV DNA result; CSF sample tested on (b) (6)
was positive (33 copies/ml) at (b) (6) .  CSF analysis performed on 13 Jan 2015 was normal.  No brain biopsy had 
been performed.  The patient tested positive for serum anti-JCV antibody at (b) (6)  on 12 Jul 2011 (index value not
provided), 10 Apr 2013 (index value = 3.155), 18 Oct 2013 (index value = 3.675), and 02 Jul 2014 (index value = 
3.3).  Prior to starting TYSABRI on 17 Jul 2009, leukocyte count was 10.4 x 10^3/l (normal range 4-11 x 10^3/l), 
lymphocyte count was 12.8%, absolute lymphocyte count was 1.3 x 10^3/ l (normal range 1.2-3.4 x 10^3/l), CD4 
was 48.9%, CD8 was 22.1%, Total CD4 was 650.37/l, CD19 was 24.2%, CD56 was 1.1%, and CD3 was 71.0%.

Prior to PML suspicion on 15 Dec 2014, leukocyte count was 6.1 x 10^3/ l, lymphocyte count was 37.8%, and 
absolute lymphocyte count was 2.3 x 10^3/ l.  At the time of PML suspicion on 13 Jan 2015, leukocyte count was 
6.4 x 10^3/ l, lymphocyte count was 44.1%, and absolute lymphocyte count was 2.8 x 10^3/ l.  Treatment for PML 
included 3 sessions of PLEX on (b) (6)  (volume =3.5 L), (b) (6)  (volume = 3.5 L), and (b) (6)
(volume 3.5 L), mefloquine 250mg po weekly since (b) (6)  mirtazapine 15mg po QD since (b) (6)
levetiracetam 500 po BID from (b) (6)  to (b) (6)  and levetiracetam 500mg po QD since (b) (6)
At the time of this report, PML has not been ruled out.
Update 19 Feb 2015: Biogen Idec considers this case confirmed for PML based on postive CSF, clinical 
presentation and radiologic evidence.
Update 19 Feb 2015: Follow-up information was received from the neurologist, via a Biogen Idec sponsored 
program of Monitored Therapy. The patient received TYSABRI from 30 Sep 2009 to 13 Jan 2015 (previously 
reported as 20 Dec 2014). The patient is still stable. New MRI (date not provided) did not show any meaningful 
alterations.
Update 21 May 2015: Follow-up information was received from the neurologist. The patient's health status 
worsened and she had seizures. It was unknown how many but the patient is better now and received antiepileptic 
treatment for seizures. A new MRI (date not provided) revealed lesions capturing contrast dye that were compatible
with IRIS (immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome). The patient underwent treatment with Lepicortinolo 
(methylprednisolone). Additional symptoms included paresis of the right side, apparent loss of strength in the right 
hand, and maintained dysarthria. The patient is scheduled to undergo a new MRI. 
Update 26 May 2015: Additional information was received from neurologist via a MS Standardized PML Data 
Collection Tool. The patient is alive and currently at home. Prior to starting TYSABRI, the patient's estimated 
Karnofsky and EDSS scores on 13 Nov 2009 were 80 (normal activity with effort; some signs or symptoms of 
disease) and 3.0. On TYSABRI prior to PML, the patient's estimated Karnofsky and EDSS scores on 21 Jul 2014 
were 80 and 2.0. At the time of PML diagnosis, the patient's estimated Karnofsky and EDSS scores on 13 Jan 2015
were 70 (cares for self; unable to carry on normal activity or to do active work) and 3.0. The patient has been tested
for serum anti-JCV antibodies (previously reported).  No lumbar puncture has been performed since last request for
information. The patient was diagnosed with IRIS which was determined by MRI findings and the following clinical 
symptoms: seizure-focal right sided partial seizures (onset 13 Mar 2015) and motor-focal right sided hemiparesis 
(onset 16 Mar 2015). The patient did not receive corticosteroids pre-IRIS and has received corticosteroids post-
IRIS. Treatment included levetiracetam (1000 mg, PO, TID) ongoing since 13 Mar 2015, methylprednisolone (1000 
mg, IV, QD) from 16 Mar 2015 to 20 Mar 2015, and methylprednisolone (1000 mg, IV, QD) from 13 Apr 2015 to 17 
Apr 2015. The patient was assessed on 25 May 2015 as recovered from PML and not recovered from IRIS. The

events of PML and IRIS were assessed as related to TYSABRI.
Update 28 May 2015: Follow-up information received included MRI images for the following dates: 09 Feb 2015 
and 13 Mar 2015.
Update 29 Jul 2015: Additional information was received from the neurologist via a MS Standardized PML Data 
Collection Tool and medical records. The patient is alive, currently at home, and on Copaxone (glatiramer acetate) 
since 17 May 2015 for radiological evidence of return of MS. Test results post-PML on 13 Mar 2015 included: 
leukocyte count of 11.4 x10(3)/uL (normal range 4.0-11.0), lymphocyte count of 56%, and absolute lymphocyte 
count of 6.4 x10(3)/uL (normal range 1.2-3.4). The most recent brain MRI was performed on 27 May 2015 with the 
following results: compared to the previous exam there has been an increase in the size of the lesion and marked 
increase in contrast enhancement. In this context it translated in PML-IRIS in progression in a patient with multiple 
sclerosis; right nodular subcortical uptake translating active demyelinating lesion. There remained framework of 
multiple lesions with hypersignal on DP, T2 and FLAIR in the white matter of both cerebral hemispheres, either 
periventricular, either in the deep and subcortical white matter; the corpus callosum is also injured, with thin 
thickness. A small lesional focus is adjacent to the floor of the 4th ventricle/left dentate nucleus. Most lesions 
present hypo-signal on T1, due to greater axonal loss, but lesions with restriction to water diffusion or with contrast 
agent uptake that suggest activity are not registered. These lesions were interpreted as being of demyelinating 
nature. There was a slight reduction in brain volume, translated by moderate enlargement of the sulci of the 
cerebral convexity and of the ventricular system. The cisterns of the base are noticeable. The patient was 
diagnosed with IRIS which was determined by MRI findings and the following clinical symptoms (previously 
reported): seizure-focal right partial seizure (right hemimotor seizure) (onset 13 Mar 2015) and motor-focal right 
hemiparesis (onset 16 Mar 2015). The patient did not receive corticosteroids pre-IRIS and has received 
corticosteroids post-IRIS (previously reported). Treatment included levetiracetam (1000 mg, PO, BID) ongoing 
since 13 Mar 2015; first cycle- methylprednisone 1000 mg/day for five days from 16 Mar 2015 to 20 Mar 2015; 
second cycle- methylprednisone 1000 mg/day from 13 Apr 2015 to 17 Apr 2015; third cycle: methylprednisone 1000
mg/day from 11 May 2015 to 15 May 2015; fourth cycle- methylprednisone 1000 mg/day from 03 Jun 2015 to 05 
Jun 2015 and 08 Jun 2015 to 09 Jun 2015; fifth cycle - methylprednisone 1000 mg/day on 02 July 2015, 03 Jul 
2015 and 06 Jul 2015. The patient was assessed on 14 Jul 2015 as recovered from PML and not recovered from 
IRIS. Estimated Karnofsky Score and EDSS Score on 14 Jul 2015 were assessed as 80 (normal activity with effort; 
some signs or symptoms of disease) and 2, respectively. The events of PML and IRIS were assessed as related to 
TYSABRI.
Update 03 Aug 2015: Follow-up information received included MRI images for the following dates: 27 May 2015.
