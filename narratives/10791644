A registered nurse from the neurologist's office at infusion site reported that an adult male patient on TYSABRI (300
mg, IV, QM) for Multiple Sclerosis from an unknown date to an unknown date and since 25 Jun 2010 and enrolled 
in a Biogen Idec sponsored marketing program of Monitored Therapy was dragging his right foot for a month and it 
had gotten worse (onset unknown).Treatment included Solumedrol for dragging right foot. The outcome for the 
event is unknown. The causality is unknown.  TYSABRI therapy continues.
Update 22 Dec 2014: The adult male patient on TYSABRI from 25 Jun 2010 reported through a Monitored therapy 
program experiencing MS relapse characterized by restless legs syndrome and continued to occur and lasted for 
hours (onset 12 Dec 2014). The patient thinks that MD stopped TYSABRI treatment due to the reported event. The 
patient went to the ER and MD ordered MRI brain scan which did not show white spots but lines so MD thought he 
had PML and spinal tap was ordered and came back negative. Treatment was not reported. The event is resolved 
and recurrent. Causality was not assessed. TYSABRI therapy was discontinued due to the MS relapse 
characterized by restless legs.
Update 07 Jan 2015: A neurologist reported via a Biogen Idec Area Business Manager (ABM) and a program of 
Monitored Therapy that the 56 year old male patient on TYSABRI was hospitalized (dates of hospitalization 
unknown) for suspect PML characterized by getting worse (NOS) (onset (b) (6) ). Internal databases indicated
that the patient's first MS symptoms were in Feb 2004. Prior MS therapy included Rebif (interferon beta 1a) from 
Jun 2004 to Apr 2010. The patient was JCV Antibody positive (date unknown). At the time of this report, the 
TOUCH database indicated that the patient had received a total of 54 infusions of TYSABRI from 25 Jun 2010 to 25
Oct 2014. The neurologist saw the patient in late Oct 2014 regarding a MS relapse (onset 31 Oct 2014; discrepant 
information; previously reported as MS Relapse characterized by restless legs). The patient was treated with 
steroids (NOS) (presumed reference to previously reported Solumedrol). An MRI on 13 Dec 2014 showed "results 
suggestive of PML" (presumed to refer to previously reported MRI brain scan in Dec 2014). A spinal tap was 
performed (date not specified; presumed to refer to previously reported spinal tap in Dec 2014) and CSF JCV DNA 
((b) (6) ) was negative (presumed to refer to previously reported negative results of spinal tap performed in Dec 
2014). A follow-up MRI on 22 Dec 2014 showed the same results as the 13 Dec 2014 MRI. On (b) (6)
another follow-up MRI was performed which showed that lesions had gotten larger, suggestive of PML. The patient 
was re-tapped on (b) (6)  and the sample was sent for CSF JCV DNA ((b) (6) ) testing. The neurologist is 
starting the patient on PLEX while awaiting the results. The outcome of the event MS Relapse is unknown. The 
event of suspect PML characterized by getting worse (NOS) is ongoing. Causality for the event of MS Relapse is 
unknown. Causality for the event of suspect PML characterized by getting worse (NOS) was assessed as possible. 
TYSABRI therapy was discontinued.
Update 08 Jan 2015: Upon telephone follow-up with the neurologist's office, a registered nurse reported that the 
male patient was hospitalized on (b) (6)  to undergo a lumbar puncture on (b) (6)  (results pending). The

patient remains hospitalized and plasmapheresis (PLEX) was started while they wait for CSF JCV PCR results to 
come back. The patient did not have any history of immunosuppressant therapy and was JCV antibody positive. 
Causality for the event was not assessed. No further information was provided.
Update 08 Jan 2015: The neurologist re-reported via a TOUCH Discontinuation Questionnaire that the male patient
was under investigation for progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML). The neurologist indicated that since 
28 Dec 2014 the patient had not been tested for the presence of anti-JCV antibodies, but also noted that the patient
was positive (presumed reference to previous positive JCV antibody results). Causality for the event was not 
assessed.
Update 09 Jan 2015: A health professional provided JCV Antibody results from the (b) (6)  Study (b) (6)
 which were as follows: 04 Apr 2011, detected (0.656 nOD); 19 Sep 2013, positive (index 2.09); 19 Mar 2014, 
positive (index 2.42); 18 Sep 2014, positive (index 2.63).
Update 02 Feb 2015: Upon telephone follow-up with a registered nurse at the neurologist's office, the registered 
nurse reported that the patient had been diagnosed with PML and was still in the hospital at the time of this report. 
The nurse was unsure of the CSF JCV DNA results from the repeat lumbar puncture on (b) (6)  and stated 
that the only thing she knew was that the patient had been diagnosed with PML. The nurse believed that the patient
had received PLEX therapy; however she was unsure if further treatment had been given. No further information 
was provided.
Update 04 Feb 2015: Upon written follow-up from the neurologist, the neurologist provided medical records that 
included MRI reports, CSF report results, and the most recent hospital note. The symptoms that prompted PML 
evaluation included right leg paresis and paroxysmal dystonia (onset (b) (6) ). The patient was hospitalized on
(b) (6)  and remains in the hospital at the time of this report. The patient was JCV Antibody positive (index 
3.56) on an unknown date. A head MRI on (b) (6)  w/o contrast showed, compared to MRI 10 Jul 2014 
(clinical indication: right leg numbness and pain, r/o CVA): 1. Findings consistent with MS; many of these findings 
are likely unchanged, particularly in the deeper cerebral WM (specificity decrease d/t motion and lack of gad 
contrast). 2. Significant new area of patchy/cloudlike confluent areas of abnormal T2/FLAIR signal in subcortical 
and immediately subjacent portions of the high/paracentral left cerebrum, along the central sulcus, more involving 
the precentral aspect. There is some facilitated diffusion. On a few images, these appear to involve the subcortical 
fibers; suspicious for PML, pattern less typical for underlying MS. 3. Incidental 4 mm structure overlying the 
posterior left convexity, not significantly changed and probably reflecting an unrelated etiology such as tiny 
meningioma or cavernoma. The patient was CSF JCV DNA ((b) (6) ) negative on (b) (6)  (< 50 copies/ml). 
A head MRI 22 Dec 2014 with and w/o contrast showed: Motion degraded study; overall similar to (b) (6)

Again seen are WM changes compatible w/ MS. However, multiple new lesions compared to the older study of 15 
Jul 2013, some more periventricular and subcortical, and show mild enhancement. However, there are more 
confluent areas that likely involve the subcortical U fibers near the left frontal vertex. Some newer lesions show faint
enhancement. Actively demyelinating MS plaques and PML remain the differential. Given short interval time period 
between studies, the lack of progression is nonspecific. C-Spine MRI (b) (6)  with and w/o contrast showed: 
exam limited by motion artifact. No obvious enhancement of the cord to suggest active demyelination; degenerative
changes to cervical spine appear relatively similar to 27 Jun 2012. On (b) (6)  a head MRI with and w/o 
contrast, compared to brain MRI (b) (6)  showed: Over 15 regions of increased T2/FLAIR signal in 
periventricular and subcortical WM. The largest region of abnormal signal is noted within the superior L frontal 
subcortical WM with a juxtacortical location. Lesion measures 3.2 x 1.9 cm and is worsened compared to (b) (6)  
(b) (6)  study and new since 01 Feb 2013 exam. A few small adjacent foci of abnormal signal also extend into the left 
frontal subcortical gyrus, also worsened since the (b) (6)  study and new since the 01 Feb 2013 exam. 
Lesions demonstrate peripheral borderline restricted diffusion but no enhancement; suspicious for worsening of 
possible PML. A new lesion is also suggested within the left posterior parietal cortex. No obvious infratentorial 
lesions are identified. Prominent T1 black holes are identified particularly at the left superior confluent lesion and at 
the left centrum semiovale involving the new anterior lesion on the left, also demonstrating borderline restrictive 
diffusion suggestive of a new focus of possible PML vs demyelination. On (b) (6)  a second lumbar puncture 
was positive for CSF JCV DNA ((b) (6) ) at 502 copies/ml.
A brain MRI on 15 Jan 2015 with and w/o contrast showed: No significant interval change when compared to (b)(6)  
(b) (6)  Re-demonstration of multiple WM lesions compatible with MS as well as large confluent high left 
frontoparietal lesion extending into the lateral left frontal lobe with peripheral restricted diffusion compatible with 
documented history of PML. Stable left posterior parietal region of FLAIR hyperintense signal with internal 
susceptibility artifact suggestive of cavernoma. A head CT on 26 Jan 2015 with and w/o contrast showed: When 
allowing for differences between this CT scan and prior MRI examinations, no interval change in the area of low-
attenuation in the posterior left frontal lobe in comparison to prior MRI scans of 21 Jan 2015 (results not provided), 
15 Jan 2015, and (b) (6)  Findings are consistent with PML. No other evidence of abnormality or white matter.
A brain MRI on 30 Jan 2015 with and w/o contrast showed: Abnormal high T2 signal involving the posterior left 
frontal and anterior left parietal lobes compatible with PML which has enlarged in comparison to the previous MRI 
of 21 Jan 2015. Multifocal T2 hyperintense lesions within the bilateral cerebral WM compatible with demyelination 
plaques given patient's history of MS, also unchanged.
The physician's progress notes for 03 Feb 2015 reported that the patient was awake, sitting up in bed, smiles at 
physician, appeared comfortable. Patient denied spasms by using thumbs up/thumbs down. Physical examination 
indicated that the patient was alert, interactive, NAD (presume no apparent distress). Significant dysarthria, but 
sings "Happy Birthday" fairly well. Right hemiplegia. Uses left side well. Communicates well with gestures, facial

expression, and 1-2 word phrases despite dysarthria. "Current facility-administered medications" at the time of this 
report included furosemide, ceftriaxone, propofol, 0.9% NaCl solution, adult analgesic-sedation-delirium guideline 
indicator (NOS), adult electrolyte protocol (NOS), alteplase, bacitracin, dopamine, fentanyl, hydrocortisone 
succinate, norepinephrine, adult ICU electrolyte protocol (NOS), insulin regular human, oxcarbazepine, baclofen, 
gabapentin, diazepam, acetaminophen, Aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid), atorvastatin, cholecalciferol, docusate sodium,
flumazenil, meclizine, oxycodone, polyethylene glycol, sennosides, simethicone, zolpidem, zonisamide, morphine, 
diphenhydramine, bisacodyl, ondansetron, calcium gluconate, and enoxaparin. On 15 Jan 2015 INR = 1.02. Lab 
tests on 21 Jan 2015 included: SGOT = 17; Bilirubin Total = 0.4; albumin = 3.4. On 29 Jan 2015 SGPT = 27. WBC 
were 18.20 on 01 Feb 2015, 11.91 on 02 Feb 2015, and 14.67 on 03 Feb 2015. Other lab tests on 03 Feb 2015 
included: RBC = 3.05; Hgb = 9.2; Hct = 26.9; PLT = 315; Na = 145; K = 3.2; Cl = 107; CO2 = 26; BUN = 12; CREA 
= 0.57; glucose = 151.  The physician stated that the patient was found to have PML and was status post TPE 
(presume therapeutic plasma exchange). It was noted that the course was complicated by paroxysmal dystonia 
refractory to multiple medications. The patient had progressively declined in neurological function with right 
hemiparesis, aphasia, dysarthria and eventually apnea, likely consistent with IRIS (onset unknown), but this 
improved significantly last week on IVMP (presume IV methylprednisolone). The patient became septic on Friday 
(presume 30 Jan 2015) and required intubation. The patient is now extubated. The plan was to proceed with 
physical and occupational therapy and try to manage spasms when they occurred. The physician noted that 
prednisone would be tapered. The outcome of the events is unknown. Causality was not assessed. 
Update 05 Feb 2015: On 05 Feb 2015 Biogen Idec considers this case to be confirmed for PML based on positive 
CSF, consistent radiological findings, and clinical symptoms.
Update 23 Mar 2015: The neurologist reported via a Biogen representative that the male patient had passed away. 
The date of death was unknown at the time of this report, and the cause of death was presumed to be PML. No 
additional information was provided.
Update 19 Aug 2015: Additional information was received from the neurologist via a MS Standardized PML Data 
Collection Tool.  The patient is deceased. The date of death was 05 Mar 2015 and the cause of death was 
assessed by neurologist to be related to TYSABRI and PML. The neurologist assessed on 18 Sep 2014 (six 
months from time of diagnosis) the patient's estimated EDSS score was 2.5.  The date of the most recent brain 
MRI was on 01 Mar 2015. The patient was not diagnosed with IRIS (therefore, the event of IRIS has been removed 
from the case). No additional information was provided.
