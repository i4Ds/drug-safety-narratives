AER 1433145 is a spontaneous case, received on 10/Jul/2014 from a physician via the Medicines and Healthcare 
Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA; United Kingdom; reference number: EYC00112707), and concerns a 77 year 
old male patient (hospital number: 1035617) who experienced the life-threatening events of progressive multifocal 
leucoencephalopathy (PML), expressive dysphasia, dysarthria and a John Cunningham (JC) virus infection while 
being treated with rituximab.
No medical history, concurrent illness, concomitant medications or past drugs were reported. 
On 06/Feb/2014, he started therapy with rituximab (dose: 700; units, route, form and frequency not reported) for 
lymphoma (non-Hodgkin's). On 04/Jun/2014, therapy with rituximab was stopped. On 18/Jun/2014, there was a 
rapid onset of expressive dysphasia and dysarthria. A nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) also showed he 
had developed progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) and a cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) polymerase 
chain reaction test detected the presence of John Cunningham (JC) virus. All the events were reported to be life-
threatening, but the PML was considered to likely be progressive and fatal.
At the time of the report, the PML was ongoing and the outcome of the events of expressive dysphasia, dysarthria 
and the JC virus infection was unknown.
The physician did not provide a causality assessment for the events of PML, expressive dysphasia, dysarthria and 
the JC virus infection.
No further information was available.
This confirmed case of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) is being expedited per 
Roche/Genentech Enhanced Pharmacovigilance Plan for PML
