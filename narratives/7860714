until death. 
In the investigator's opinion, the event of neutropenic sepsis was causally related to pemetrexed and cisplatin, but 
not to radiotherapy, as the low neutrophil count was a result of chemotherapy. The event of pneumonia was 
unrelated to pemetrexed, cisplatin or radiotherapy. Neutropenic sepsis resulted in pneumonia. Both events were
