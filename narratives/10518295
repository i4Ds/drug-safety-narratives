patients receiving treatment with natalizumab, and these events are mentioned within the WARNINGS and 
PRECAUTION section of the Tysabri U.S. Product Information. The likely cause for JC virus positivity is the 
patient's prior therapy with natalizumab, and not the use of Copaxone. Causality: JC Virus Positive - Not Related to 
Copaxone; Possibly related to prior natalizumab therapy.
Because this is a spontaneous case, regulatory distribution will be handled as though it is a related case.
