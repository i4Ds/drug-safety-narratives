A neurologist spontaneously reported that a young male patient (age unspecified) receiving TYSABRI (300 mg, IV, 
QM) from February 2012 to February 2014 experienced a suspicion of PML. Indication for Tysabri was multiple 
sclerosis (MS), diagnosed on an unreported date. No medical history or concomitant medications were reported. 
The neurologist reported that the patient discontinued treatment with Tysabri in late February 2014. The patient had
been treated with Tysabri for two years and had received 24 doses. The patient tested positive for anti JCV 
antibodies (STRATIFY test) on an unspecified date. The patient had no prior immunosuppression use. On an 
unspecified date, four lesions were observed in the last MRI performed before the patient interrupted treatment with
Tysabri. The MRI performed after the suspicion of PML was "catastrophic"; according to the radiologist. The MRI 
was reported to "show a clear PML". The MRI shows that, with the exception of the cortex, the whole white matter

is demyelinated. The patient was admitted since (b) (6)  in the hospital, with symptoms and triplegia. A 
lumbar puncture was performed on (b) (6)  The CSF sample will be sent to a local lab to detect the 
presence of JCV by PCR. The patient has been treated with Acyclovir.
The neurologist assessed the suspicion of PML to be related to Tysabri. At the time of this report, the outcome of 
the suspicion of PML was not yet recovered. Tysabri was discontinued at the end of February 2014.
Update 30 Apr 2014: New information was provided by the neurologist. The PCR result was positive in (b) (6)
250 copies of JCV were detected by PCR. The patient had stopped treatment with corticosteroids and on (b) (6)  
(b) (6)  the patient was worse;  he had stopped talking. However, corticosteroid therapy was resumed and on (b) (6)  
(b) (6)   the patient was better.
Update 12 May 2014: MRI images from (b)(6)  
(b)
(6) , and 
(b) (6)  scans were uploaded in (b) (6)
Update 15 May 2014:Upon internal review, Biogen Idec considers this case to be confirmed for PML based on 
clinical symptoms, positive CSF, and MRI findings.
Update 22 May 2014: A report from the Regulatory Authority of Spain (ES-AGEMED-415808338) reported a  43 
years old male patient received treatment with Tysabri 300 mg once per month, for multiple sclerosis, from 02 Feb
2012 until  11 Feb 2012. On (b) (6)  the patient was diagnosed with progressive multifocal 
leukoencephalopathy. The outcome of the event is unknown. The patient was also being treated with Lioresal 20 
mg daily.
Update 02 Jun 2014: New information provided by the neurologist. The patient developed multiple sclerosis in June
2003. Previous therapies included interferon beta 1b and corticosteroids to treat MS relapses. The first STARTIFY 
positive test result for the detection of anti-JC virus antibodies was obtained in December 2011. The symptom that 
prompted PML evaluation was seizure. Besides, the patient's mother had noticed that the patient experienced 
urinary incontinence for two days, and pounding away at the interview, the neurologist reached the conclusion that 
the patient may had been more irritable for a month. Currently the patient's status is, left hemiplegia, paresis of the 
right leg with a severe frontal cognitive impairment with apathy and important language disorder. The neurologist 
wants to include the patient in a center for brain injury to improve the overall rehabilitation.
Update 19 Jun 2014: New information provided by the neurologist. The patient was transferred to another hospital 
to continue the rehabilitation. On(b) (6)  the patient will be transferred to a brain injury center.
Update 11 Sep 2014: Additional information was provided by the neurologist. The neurologist did not know if IRIS

took place or if all the clinical symptoms were due to PML. The neurologist also reported that plasmapheresis was 
not performed because clinical symptoms occurred two and a half months after TYSABRI discontinuation.
Update 12 Sep 2014: Additional information was received from a neurologist via a MS Standardized PML Data 
Collection Tool. The patient is alive and is currently in a rehab facility. Estimated Karnofsky and EDSS scores were 
assessed as follows: 80 (normal activity with effort; some signs or symptoms of disease) and 5 on 30 Jan 2012; 80 
on 23 Sep 2013, EDSS 5 on 18 Dec 2013, and 20 (very sick; hospital admission necessary; active supportive 
treatment necessary) and 9 on (b) (6)  An HIV test performed on 15 Dec 2011 was negative. The patient 
tested positive for serum anti-JCV antibody status on 22 Dec 2011 and on 18 Dec 2013 (index value 3.439).  Prior 
to starting TYSABRI on 02 Feb 2012, the patient had a leukocyte count of 4.77 x 1000/ul (normal range 3.9-10.5 x 
1000/ul), lymphocyte count of 46.1% (normal range 15-60%), and absolute lymphocyte count of 2198 (units and 
normal range not provided).  On 11 Feb 2014 (when the patient was on TYSABRI therapy prior to PML), leukocyte 
count was 8.13 x 1000/ul, lymphocyte count was 50.6%, and absolute lymphocyte count was 4113.  At the time of 
PML (pre-PLEX) on (b) (6)  leukocyte count was 13.89 x 1000/ul, lymphocyte count was 21.7%, and absolute 
lymphocyte count was 3014.  On (b) (6)  beta 2 microglobulin was 3.9 mcg/ml (normal range 1.1-2.4 mcg/ml).
 An MRI was performed prior to PML diagnosis on 12 Jul 2013 (results not reported). An MRI was performed at 
time of PML diagnosis on (b) (6)  (results not reported). A lumbar puncture was performed on (b) (6)
the CSF sample was tested on (b) (6)  and was positive for JCV DNA at 240 copies per mL. The patient was 
diagnosed with IRIS, which was determined by clinical symptoms. IRIS symptoms included frontal syndrome 
(cognitive/ behavioral), mixed aphasia (speech), secondary generalized partial seizure (focal seizure) and fever, all 
with an onset date of (b) (6)  and multifocal motor (NOS) symptoms (onset unknown). The patient received 
methylprednisolone 1 gram IV daily for three consecutive days prior to onset of IRIS. Post-IRIS onset, he received 
methylprednisolone 1 gram IV daily from (b) (6)  to (b) (6)  As of (b) (6)  the patient had not 
recovered from PML and the outcome of the event of IRIS was unknown. Causality for the event of PML was 
assessed as related to TYSABRI; causality of the event of IRIS to TYSABRI was unknown.
Update 28 Dec 2014: Additional information was received from a physician via a MS Standardized PML Data 
Collection Tool. The patient is alive, residing at home, and is not currently on any MS therapy. The physician 
assessed the patient?s estimated Karnofsky and EDSS scores on 17 Sep 2014 to be 50 (requires considerable 
assistance and frequent medical care) and 8 to 8.5. A brain MRI was performed on 30 Jun 2014 (results not 
provided). The following labs were obtained on (b) (6)  leukocyte count 6.48 x10(3)/ microliter (normal range 
3.9 to 10.5 x10(3)/ microliter); lymphocyte count 39 percent (normal range 15 to 60 percent); absolute lymphocyte 
count 2527. As of 26 Dec 2014, the patient had not recovered from PML. Causality for the event of PML was 
assessed as related to TYSABRI. The outcome of the event of IRIS and causality to TYSABRI were not provided.

Collection Tool and a separate email. The patient is alive, currently at home, and not receiving any other therapy for
his MS. The neurologist assessed the patient?s estimated Karnofsky and EDSS scores on 04 Mar 2015 to be 50 
(requires considerable assistance and frequent medical care) and 8. The most recent brain MRI was performed on 
30 Jun 2014 (results not provided).  PML status was assessed on 04 Mar 2015 as not recovered.  The causal 
relationship between TYSABRI and PML was assessed as related. The outcome of the event of IRIS and causality 
to TYSABRI were not provided.
