A neurologist reported that a 48 year old female patient on TYSABRI (300 mg, IV, QM) for Multiple Sclerosis from 
10 Nov 2009 to 13 Sep 2012 experienced suspected PML (onset Sep 2012).  The neurologist confirmed that the 
patient received a total of 35 infusions of TYSABRI.  The patient was previously treated with azathioprine 25 mg 
between 14 Jan 2005 and Oct 2008, cyclophosphamide once on 28 Dec 2006, AVONEX (Interferon beta-1a) from 
22 Sep 2006 to 04 Oct 2008, and IVIG 15 gram once a month from Feb 2009 to Oct 2009.  On an unknown date, 
the patient tested positive for anti-JCV antibodies.  In May 2012, the patient experienced an MS attack that was 
characterized by vertigo, and was treated with Solu-medrol (methylprednisolone) 3 grams.  On 20 Sep 2012, an 
MRI was obtained.  In comparison with the previous MRI performed on the 01 June 2012, there were new

differential diagnosis PML was necessary to consider as complication of treatment; and other bearings of 
demyelination (bilateral periventricular and in pons paramedialy right) were stationary.  The patient's current status 
included vertigo - "sin" hemiparesis.  The patient was treated with Solu-medrol 3 mg.  The outcome for the event 
suspected PML is unknown. The causality for the event of suspected PML is unknown.  TYSABRI therapy was 
discontinued. Further information is expected.
Update 24 Sep 2012: On follow-up, it was determined that the patient is enrolled in (b) (6)
 A study investigator reported that the female patient receiving TYSABRI (300 mg, IV, QM) 
from 11 Oct 2009 experienced sin hemiparesis and vertigo on 15 Sep 2012, which was noted to have become 
serious on 20 Sep 2012. Indication for TYSABRI was relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis diagnosed on an 
unknown date. The most recent TYSABRI infusion was administered on 13 Sep 2012. The patient had received a 
total of 35 infusions to date. No relevant medical history, concomitant medication or previous medication was 
reported.
It was reported that the patient experienced sin hemiparesis and vertigo on 15 Sep 2012. The subject was treated 
with Solu-Medrol (methylprednisolone) 3 gr from 18 Sep 2012 to 20 Sep 2012. On (b) (6)  the patient was 
admitted to the hospital, but discharged on the same day. Testing on 20 Sep 2012 included JCV cerebral spinal 
fluid (CSF); results were pending. The patient underwent plasmapheresis x 2 on 20 Sep 2012 and 21 Sep 2012.
The investigator considered the sin hemiparesis and vertigo related to TYSABRI. At the time of this report, the 
outcome of the events was not recovered. Action taken with TYSABRI was reported as "Serious Adverse Event 
(SAE) occurred post therapy"; current TYSABRI disposition was not provided. Further information is expected.
Update 27 Sep 2012: Follow up information was received from the neurologist that initially reported case, who 
stated that JCV DNA CSF testing performed at a local lab in Vienna was positive; specific quantitative/qualitative 
test results were not provided. No additional information was provided. Further information is expected. 
Company comment: Contribution of TYSABRI to the reported events of suspected PML and MS relapse cannot be 
excluded.

and MRI consistent with PML.
Update 17 Oct 2012: Additional information was received from the neurologist via a MS Standardized PML Data 
Collection Tool. On 10 Nov 2009 (prior to TYSABRI therapy), the neurologist assessed the patient's estimated 
Karnofsky and EDSS scores to be 100 (normal, no complaints; no evidence of disease) and 1.5, respectively. On 
06 Mar 2012 the patient had a blood JCV DNA test with results reported as positive and a serum anti-JCV antibody 
test with results reported as positive; testing performed at (b) (6) , Denmark. On 01 Jun 2012, the patient had an 
MRI done (results not provided). On 13 Sep 2012 (patient on TYSABRI prior to PML), the neurologist assessed the 
patient's estimated Karnofsky and EDSS scores to be 100 and 1.5, respectively. On(b) (6)  the patient 
underwent a lumbar puncture with subsequent testing for CSF JCV DNA on 24 Sep 2012 which revealed positive 
results at 2.7 E + 01 (which equals 27) copies/mL; testing performed at (b) (6)
 Austria. No additional lumbar punctures have been performed. On (b) (6)  (at the time of PML
diagnosis), the neurologist assessed the patient's estimated Karnofsky and EDSS scores to be 70 (cares for self; 
unable to carry on normal activity or to do active work) and 3.0, respectively. As of 17 Oct 2012, the patient was in 
the hospital and had not recovered from PML. Causality for the event of PML was assessed as related to TYSABRI.
Update 18 Oct 2012: Additional information received by the neurologist reported that the patient was diagnosed 
with the relapsing remitting form of Multiple Sclerosis. The patient had benefited throughout the treatment period 
[presumed in reference to TYSABRI] and only in May 2012 did she temporarily suffer from an attack of vertigo 
(previously reported as MS relapse). She was treated with Solu-Medrol (methylprednisolone) with good effect. 
Serum JCV antibodies tested on 06 Mar 2012 was assessed to be positive. On 13 Sep 2012, the patient received 
her last dose of TYSABRI. On 18 Sep 2012, the patient went to the physician because of weakness of the left hand 
which had lasted for about 3-4 days. She was treated with Solu-Medrol without improvement and her neurologic 
findings were more significant c/b left-sided hemiparesis, more expressed at left upper limb. On (b) (6)  the 
patient was admitted to the hospital. An MRI of the brain and cervical spine was performed on the same day and 
the MRI confirmed PML. Additionally, an LP was performed on (b) (6)  and sent to a local lab on 24 Sep 2012.
The results were reported by phone on 26 Sep 2012 which found the sample to be 2 times weakly positive. The 
patient was started on plasmaphersis on(b) (6)  and has now received a total of 5 treatments at the time of 
this report. Subsequently, infusions of Solu-Medrol was administered with a plan to administer a cumulative dose of
5g ( at the time of this report, the patient had received a total of 4g with a dose of 250 mg daily). The patient's 
clinical status at the time of this report as follows: paresis of left upper limb with acral maximum persists, mobility of 
left lower extremity is improved, walking and milk lightheadedness. On 17 Oct 2012, an MRI of the brain and 
cervical spine was performed. The MRI did not demonstrate new bearing of PML, the current area right F-P only 
slightly signal highlighted. New pathology was not present. Causality was assessed as related to TYSABRI therapy 
(with respect to the results of tests, course of disease, and clinical finding).
