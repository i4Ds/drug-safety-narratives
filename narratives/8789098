subsequently enrolled in (b) (6)   At the time of the event on 04 September 2012, the subject had received a total 
of 57 TYSABRI doses, with her last dose on 02 July 2012.
On 04 September 2012 a neurologist spontaneously reported via a Biogen Idec Medical Science Liaison,  that the 
subject  experienced PML infection (onset 04 Sep 2012).  At the time of this report, the TOUCH database indicated 
the patient received 57 doses of TYSABRI from 11 Jul 2007 to 02 Jul 2012. Prior MS therapies includde Copaxone 
from 2005 to May 2007.  The results of CSF testing for JCV antibodies from (b) (6)  Lab on an unknown date was 
positive  at >2000 copies/ml.  Treatment has not been reported and the outcome is unknown.  Causality  was not 
reported.   It is unknown if TYSABRI therapy will continue. 
On 10 September 2010, a pharmacist spontaneously reported  that the subject had progressive multifocal 
leukoencephalopathy (PML).  A lumbar puncture showed elevated JC virus (JCV). The reporter advised that the 
symptoms that led to the subject being tested for PML were left lower extremity weakness, decreased balance and 
ataxia when walking that was not helped by steroids. The reporter further mentioned that the subject had been 
hospitalized.
On 10 September 2012, receipt of medical records  revealed:   On 21 Mar 2012, MRI of brain with and without 
contrast reported impression: Findings again compatible with changes of demyelinating disease. There are a few 
small new foci of demyelinating disease within the left frontal white matter. No abnormal enhancement identifier to 
suggest active demyelination however.   A Proton MR spectroscopy findings are within normal limits;  On 12 Jul 
2012 MRI of brain with and without contrast impression results show no change in brain MRI since study in 21 Mar 
2012. There remains of multiple foci of white matter signal change in the deep and periventricular white matte of 
both cerebral hemispheres consistent with MS. No new or enlarging plaque is identified. No plaque enhancement is
present to indicate active demyelination. No MRI features are present to suggest PML;  04 Sep 2012 MRI brain 
impression results:  No MRI features to suggest PML;  New left brachium pontis lesion. Findings are concerning for 
progression of demyelinating disease ; Otherwise, stable supratentorial, and infratentorial white matter lesions 
without enhancement consistent with known MS;   On 05 Sep 2012, MRI  spectroscopy findings are within normal 
limits and a spectroscopy  addendum  is consistent with progression of white matter neuronal volume loss when 
compared to 12 Jul 2012 exam.
The results of the lumbar puncture CSF testing  for  JCV by PCR on 27 August 2012 was positive with 3782 copies/
mL;  CSF differential lymphocytes  100% , 3 cells counted;  WBC 4 /ul (0-6) and RBC 2 /ul (high)(0-1).

Update 12 Sep 2012: Biogen Idec considers this a confirmed PML case based on the positive CSF, MRI findings, 
and clinical symptoms
Update 10 oct 2012: The neuroloigst reported that the female patient enrolled in a program of monitored therapy,
was doing better, and still has some [unspecified] symptoms and issues post PML.
Update 29 November 2012: In response to a request for additional information, a health professional from the 
investigator site reported via email that the subject is alive and as of the last visit on 21 November 2012 she has not
been diagnosed with IRIS. The subject is going for an MRI on 29 November 2012.
Update 05 Dec 2012: Additional information was received from the office of the treating neurologist. The neurologist
reported that the patient is alive and living at home. At present the patient is not on any MS therapy, and as of 21 
Nov 2012 she had not been diagnosed with IRIS. The patient's most recent cerebral MRI was performed on 30 Nov
2012 and revealed (in comparison with MRI's performed on 26 Sep 2012 and on 18 Oct 2012) that there is a 
continued worsening of the abnormal increased T2 signal involving the left brachium pontis and pons. There is now 
progressive signal in the right brachium pontis. The involvement of the pons is much more pronounced than in 
comparison to the previous examination. There is no definite abnormal enhancement in these areas of abnormal 
signal. As seen previously there are scattered foci of increased T2 signal in the deep white matter of the cerebral 
hemispheres. This is not significantly changed. I do not see any abnormal enhancement in the supratentorial brain 
parenchyma. The coronal T2 sequence shows the hippocampi formations to be symmetric and normal. Paranasal 
sinuses are clear. Proton MR Spectroscopy (supratentorial): Interval worsening of the confluent increased T2 signal
in the left brachium pontis and pons. This is particularly more pronounced in the pons and there is new involvement 
of the right brachium pontis. Given the rapid progression of this posterior fossa disease, particularly since 26 Sep 
2012, and relative stability of the supratentorial disease, I highly doubt this is a rapidly progressive MS. Most likely 
this is changes of PML. Another possibility which I believe is extremely unlikely is central pontine myelolysis/osmotic
demyelination syndrome. The patient is an outpatient so I believe this diagnosis is extremely unlikely; I mention this 
differential diagnosis only to be complete.
Update 28 March 2013: Upon request for additional follow up information, an email response was received from a 
healthcare professional at the neurologist's office. The healthcare professional indicated that the patient is alive, 
residing at home and is not currently on any therapy for MS. On 07 March 2013 the patient had an MRI with results 
reported as stabilized clinically. The patient has not been diagnosed with IRIS.
Update 03 September 2013: In response to a request for follow up information, a response was received from a 
healthcare professional at the neurologist?s office. The healthcare professional reported that the patient is alive, 
residing at home and is in the process of transitioning toTECFIDERA for MS therapy. The most recent MRI was

done on 07 Mar 2013 with results reported as stable supratent, some progression in infratent. IRIS treatment 
included IV Solumedrol. It was reported that currently there are no clinical or radiologic signs of IRIS.
Update 16 Jan 2014:  A report was received from literature.  Schwab N, Schneider-Hohendorf T, Posevitz V, Breuer
J, G?bel K, Windhagen S, Et. Al.  L-Selectin is a possible biomarker for individual PML risk in Natalizumab-treated 
MS patients.  American Academy of Neurology.  Published online 07 Aug 2013; DOI 
10.1212/WNL.0b013e3182a351fb.  The female patient tested positive for anti-JCV antibodies on an unknown date. 
The patient had a total of 57 infusions of TYSABRl.  The patient's average %CD62L of CD4+ T-cells was 26.1.
Update 14 Aug 2013:  Upon internal review it was determined that the contact date for the update initially reported 
for 16 Jan 2014 regarding the report from literature (Schwab N, Schneider-Hohendorf T, Posevitz V, Breuer J,

Update 11 Mar 2014:  A report was received from literature.  Schneider-Hohendorf T, Schwab N, and Wiendl H.
Dynamic biomarkers for clinical efficacy and individual PML prevention under Natalizumab therapy.  Multiple 
Sclerosis Journal.  2013; 19 (S1):  559-573.  The authors assessed 381 long-term Natalizumab-treated (18 to 80 
months) MS patients, including 16 patients having developed PML.  No major changes in peripheral T-cell 
compartments were noted, but the T cells in the CSF of natalizumab-treated patients showed "an almost exclusive 
effector-memory signature".  The pattern was not seen in MS patients treated with other drugs, but was seen in 
non-inflammatory neurological diseases.  CD49d expression on peripheral T cells was immediately down regulated 
upon treatment initiation, but recovered to the value of healthy controls during long term therapy.  CD49d 
expression on CSF T cells was completely absent.  In contrast to the down regulation of CD49d, PSGL-1 was 
strongly up regulated in the periphery.  The L-selectin (CD62L) showed a strong correlation with PML development. 
Eight patients had given blood prior to PML diagnosis and the percentage of CD62L expressing CD4+ T cells was 
significantly lower in all of these patients (4.6%) when compared to non-PML natalizumab treated patients (40.2%).
Update 18 March 2014: In response to a request for additional information, a healthcare professional at the 
neurologist?s office reported that the subject is alive, residing at home, and is currently on Tecfidera for MS 
therapy. The subject is stabilized and current estimated EDSS score is approximately 6.5 (date unspecified). A 
brain MRI was performed on 07 October 2013 with results reported as follows: PML patient with severe and 
extensive involvement of the pons and brachium pontis, there is significant progression of associated volume loss, 
with disease progression most notable in the right cerebellar hemisphere. The outcome of the events of PML and 
IRIS and causality to TYSABRI were not provided, however it was noted that the patient is "stabilized".

Update 03 Sep 2014: Additional information was received from the neurologist via a MS Standardized PML Data 
Collection Tool and MRI diagnostic report. The subject is alive, residing at home, and is currently on Tecfidera for 
MS therapy since approximately 08 May 2013. The neurologist assessed the subject's estimated Karnofsky score 
on 02 Aug 2014 to be 60 (requires occasional assistance, but is able to care for most of her personal needs). The 
last brain MRI was performed on 07 October 2013 with results reported as follows: 1. PML patient with severe and 
extensive involvement of the pons and brachium pontis, there is significant progression of associated volume loss, 
with disease progression most notable in the right cerebellar hemisphere, as above. Very subtle right pontine 
enhancement since prior exam is also slightly progressed. Spectrum from large single voxel posterior fossa 
spectroscopic evaluation remains markedly abnormal, not significantly changed. 2. Stable supratentorial MS 
involvement, with continued slight improvement in supratentorial white matter spectroscopic evaluation, with dated 
now within 2 standard deviations of the norm. 3. There remains no significant lateral ventriculomegaly or corpus 
callosal atrophy. 4. Stable minor chronic paranasal sinus disease. The patient has recovered from PML and has 
recovered from IRIS. Causality for the events was assessed as related to TYSABRI.
