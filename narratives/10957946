FOIA Case Report Information
Concomitant medications were not reported. 
On an unspecified date in (b) (6)  the patient experienced symptoms specific to progressive multifocal 
leukoencephalopathy and was hospitalized. On an unspecified date, although the hospitalization had been planned 
to be temporary, the patient was still in the hospital because of persistent paralysis. 
Action taken with bortezomib was not applicable. At the time of this report, the patient had not recovered from 
progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy. 
The reporter recognized that, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy could also be induced by non-drug 
factors and hence, the possibility of a causal relationship between the event and bortezomib was considered to be 
minimal. The reporter assessed the causality between progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy and bortezomib 
as possible. 
This report was serious (hospitalization).
