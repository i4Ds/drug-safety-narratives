Serious: Leukoencephalopathy and JC virus test positive are listed events of azathioprine, as per RSI. Causality is 
assessed as possible due to known safety profile of the drug. Leukoencephalopathy and JC virus test positive are 
unlisted events of prednisolone, as per RSI. Causality is unassessable due to lack of information.
