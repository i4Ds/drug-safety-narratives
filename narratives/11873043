Sender's Comments: Additional information (26Jan2016) does not change the assessment of the case; it remains 
serious and not related to Gammagard S/D therapy.
05Feb2016
The available details in the report do not provide a reasonable alternative explanation for the reported cough, 
dysphonia and there are facts (temporal relationship) to suggest an association with Gammagard SD; therefore 
assessed as possibly related.
