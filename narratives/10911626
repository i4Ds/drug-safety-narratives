Medically significant
A neurologist spontaneously reported that a 48 year old male patient on TYSABRI (300 mg, IV, QM) (lot number 
unknown) for Multiple Sclerosis for 7 years from 2008 to 2015 was hospitalized from (b) (6)  to an unknown date 
for PML characterized by problems recalling words, confusion, psycho syndrome last week (onset (b) (6) ).   
According to the reporter, PML management measures were done. The patient's JCV serostatus was positive and 
JCV index was 3.5 (dates unknown; high index had been stable for a long period of time).  PML risk in this patient 
had been on borderline high for a long time; however, TYSABRI treatment was continued in the past.  Currently, the
clinical status of the patient is stable and the patient is doing well. The event of PML characterized by problems 
recalling words, confusion, psycho syndrome is ongoing. The causality for the event of PML characterized by 
problems recalling words, confusion, psycho syndrome is unknown.  TYSABRI therapy was discontinued.

FOIA Case Report Information
Update 02 Mar 2015:   Follow-up information was received from a different neurologist. The hospitalization for PML 
did not occur last week as indicated in the initial report, but occurred "some time" ago (NOS).  Plasmapheresis was 
done.  The patient will be discharged from the hospital in the course of this week (week 10).  The patient also 
experienced IRIS symptoms (onset unknown) and was treated with corticosteroids (NOS).   After discontinuation of 
corticosteroids (NOS) and subsequent worsening of symptoms, corticosteroids (NOS) were restarted again at 
higher dosing.  The outcome of the event IRIS symptoms is unknown and the causality of the event IRIS symptoms
was not assessed. No further information was provided.
Update 04 Mar 2015:  Additional information was received from another neurologist.  The patient had been JCV 
serostatus positive for several years. No further information was provided.
Update 05 Mar 2015:  Follow up information was received from the initial reporting neurologist. The male patient 
was 48 years old at the time of PML diagnosis.  No immunosuppressive therapies before starting TYSABRI 
treatment were reported.  According to the neurologist, at the time of PML diagnosis, the patient had been treated 
with TYSABRI for 8 years (correction to previously reported 7 years).  The patient was previously hospitalized on (b)(6)
(b) (6)  when the patient had difficulties recalling words.  Results of CSF JCV DNA of sample from (b) (6)
detected 25 copies of JCV DNA; no additional CSF sampling or testing performed. At the time of hospital admission
(presume (b) (6) ), a MRI performed was without any findings; later on (date unknown; after performing 
plasmapheresis), IRIS typical MRI findings were noted.
Update 19 Mar 2015: Follow up information received from the initial reporting neurologist indicated that the patient's
next appointment at the clinic will be in Apr 2015. At the time of this report, the MRI images had not been 
processed but will be provided.
Update 08 Apr 2015:  Additional information was received from a neurologist via a MS PML Data Collection Form: 
Suspect.  The patient's initials and age were provided.  The patient on TYSABRI from 20 Feb 2007 to 22 Oct 2014 
(dates discrepant; therapy was not interrupted for greater than 3 months) was being evaluated for PML due to 
clinical signs and symptoms, duration of TYSABRI therapy, and JCV-ab positive with high index. The patient was 
currently at home.  The patient was diagnosed with MS on 26 Jan 2007.  MS disease symptoms prior to suspected 
PML included spastic hypertonia on the left, positive Babinski (motor) (onset unknown), st. p. RBN (retrobulbar 
neuritis) both sides (visual) (onsets Jul 2006 and Jan 2007), and hemihypoesthesia, trigeminal neuralgia V2,3 left 
(sensory) (onset Dec 2006). The patient has never received prior immunosuppressant therapy or 
immunomodulatory therapy.  Signs and symptoms which led to the evaluation for possible PML included 
language/word-finding problems (cognitive/behavioral) (onset 10 Nov 2014).  MRI at the time of suspected PML 
diagnosis was performed on (b) (6)  and a MRI prior to suspected PML diagnosis was performed on 12 Sep 
2014 (results not provided).  The following lumbar punctures were performed:  on (b) (6)  (date discrepant) -

CSF sample was tested at a local lab on (b) (6)  and CSF JCV DNA result was positive (25 copies/ml; 
previously reported) and on 28 Jan 2015 - CSF sample was tested on 28 Jan 2015 at a local lab and CSF JCV 
DNA result was positive (50 copies/mL).  The patient tested positive (index value = 3.333) for serum anti-JCV 
antibody on 02 Sep 2014 at(b) (6)   A brain biopsy has not been performed.  Test results prior to starting 
TYSABRI on 08 Oct 2014 included the following:  leukocyte count of 7.6 G/l (normal range 4.0-10.0), lymphocyte 
count of 44% (normal range 20-40%), and an absolute lymphocyte count of 3.3 G/l (normal range 0.8-4.0).  Test 
results at the time of PML suspicion on (b) (6)  included the following: leukocyte count of 9.3 G/l (normal 
range 4.0-9.0), lymphocyte count of 43.3%, and absolute lymphocyte count of 4.02 G/l (normal range 1.20-3.50).  A
CSF analysis was performed on (b) (6)  results were abnormal with protein 88.1mg/dl, albumin 71.9 mg/dl, 
IgG 5.06 mg/dl, albumin quotient 14.95, and OCB (oligoclonal bands) positive.  Treatment for PML included 3 
sessions of PLEX (total volume: 9000 ml) on the following dates: on (b) (6)  (volume 3000 ml), (b) (6)
(volume 3000 ml), and (b) (6)  (volume 3000 ml).  The patient also received PML treatment with mirtazapine 
and corticosteroids (NOS).  The patient has never been and is not currently enrolled in a Biogen Idec Clinical Trial 
or non-Biogen Idec Clinical Trial.  At the time of this report, PML had not been ruled out.
Update 13 Apr 2015:  Additional information was provided by the initial reporting neurologist.  Laboratory reports 
were provided.  CSF test results from (b) (6)  showed total albumin of 88.1 mg/dl (previously reported as 
protein; reference range 20-40), albumin of 71.9 mg/dl (reference range 11-35), and IgG of 5.06 mg/dl (reference 
range 1-3) (these CSF results were previously reported without reference ranges provided).  Testing of the serum 
on (b) (6)  showed glucose of 183 mg/dl (reference range 74-109), total albumin of 62.6 g/l (reference range 
64-83), IgG of 593 mg/dl (reference range 700-1600), and IgM of 33 mg/dl (reference range 40-230).  Albumin 
quotient (CSF/Serum) on (b) (6)  was 14.95 (reference range 0-7.20; previously reported without reference 
range).   Lab report from(b) (6)  indicated that the patient tested positive for JCV antibodies on 02 Sep 2014 
(previously reported).   Additional lab report of blood testing showed no abnormal relevant test result.
Update 13 Apr 2015:  Additional information was provided by the initial reporting neurologist.  MRI reports from 12 
Sep 2014, (b) (6)  11 Dec 2014, and 19 Dec 2014 were provided.  Brain MRI on 12 Sep 2014 (results 
previously not provided) compared with MRI from 25 Jul 2006 showed multiple new plaques of demyelination in the 
supra- and infratentorial white matter, in the area of the thalami, the midbrain and the pons.  No clear CA-
enhancement (a sign of a recent lesion) could be distinguished. Normal width of the inner and outer CF 
interspaces, no shift of the midline, and no signs of intracranial pressure were noted.  Brain MRI on (b) (6)
(results previously not provided) compared to MRI on 09 Sep 2014 showed previously existing plaques unchanged 
with regards to extension and size. A pathologic CA-enhancement was not detectable. No signs of newly developed
white matter changes. It was substantially unchanged to previous investigation.   Brain MRI on 11 Dec 2014 
compared to previous MRI on (b) (6)  showed no relevant changes; the previously described lesion was 
unchanged with regards to extension and size and there were no signs for a pathologic CA-enhancement.

Additionally, there was no sign for a periventricular confluent structure formation, no clear sign for PML.  Brain MRI 
on 19 Dec 2014 compared to MRI on 11 Dec 2014 showed no changes. The lesions appeared unchanged with 
regards to form, number, size and CA behavior, respectively.  T2-hyperintense disorders in the area of the basal 
ganglia and the brain stem bilaterally, as well as cerebellar right more than left were also unchanged (however, 
compatible also with the differential diagnosis of PML). After CA-administration, no pathologic enhancement was 
observed. Width of the inner and outer CF interspaces enhanced inadequately with regards to age. The 
supratentorial ventricular system appeared widely symmetric and median.
Update 16 Apr 2015:  Upon internal review, this case has been confirmed for PML based on positive CSF, clinical 
symptoms, and consistent MRI findings.
Update 04 May 2015: Additional information was received from the neurologist via a Standardized MS PML Data 
Collection Tool. At the time of PML diagnosis, the patient's height was 177 cm and weight was 84 kg.  The patient 
tested negative for anti-natalizumab antibodies on 19 May 2014. The patient's estimated Karnofsky and EDSS 
scores on 10 Oct 2014 were 80 (normal activity with effort; some signs or symptoms of disease) and 3.5, 
respectively. The patient's estimated Karnofsky and EDSS scores on (b) (6)  were 40 (disabled; requires 
special care and assistance) and 4.5. The patient had a negative HIV test result on (b) (6)  Estimated 
Karnofsky and EDSS scores on 20 Nov 2014 were 40 and 4.5.  No lumbar puncture had been performed since last 
update. At the time of this report, the patient is alive, residing at home, and has not been diagnosed with IRIS 
(discrepant from previous report). As of 01 Apr 2015, the outcome of the event PML was assessed as both 
recovered and not recovered (to be clarified; previously reported as not recovered). Causality for the event of PML 
was assessed as related to TYSABRI.
Update 18 May 2015: Additional information was received from the neurologist for clarification of PML outcome.
Clinically, the patient is in remission and can be considered accordingly as recovered. However, in the last CSF 
sample (date not provided), JCV copies were still detectable (detailed results not provided) and thus he is not 
cured. A further CSF sampling is planned.
Update 28 May 2015:  Additional information was received from the neurologist. During the patient's upcoming visit 
on 02 Jun 2015, both a MRI and LP (lumbar puncture) shall be performed.
Update 24 Jun 2015: Additional information was received from the neurologist via a Standardized MS PML Data 
Collection Tool. The patient is alive, residing at home, and his current preventative MS therapy has included IVIG 
since 07 Apr 2015. On 02 Jun 2015, the neurologist assessed the patient s estimated Karnofsky and EDSS scores
to be 80 (normal activity with effort; some signs or symptoms of disease) and 5.5. The latest brain MRI was 
performed on 03 Jun 2015: in comparison to the previous preliminary examination dated 23 Feb 2015, the signal

intensity decreased significantly in extent and signal in the basal ganglia area both sides. The signal intensity right 
cerebellar impress on signal intensity and extent decreasing. Decreasing also the changes in the left cerebellar 
peduncle. The pre-existing, partially radially arranged plaques both sides supratentorial unchanged. Almost 
constant signal intensity in the pons. No evidence of recent diffusion restriction. No evidence of pathological CM 
enhancements. Recent testing performed on 02 Jun 2015 included a total leukocyte count of 6.3 G/I (reference 
range 4-9), lymphocyte count of 43.8 % (reference range 50-70), an absolute lymphocyte count of 2.74 G/I 
(reference range 1.2-3.5), a neutrophil granulocytes relative of 46.3% (reference range 50.0-70.0), a basophil 
granulocytes relative of 1.4 % (reference range 0.0--1.0), and a PDW-SD of 18.5 fl (reference range 9.0-17.0). 
Virology labs on 05 Jun 2015 showed no evidence of a viral infection. CS JC virus ultrasensitive test was negative 
at <50. The patient has not been diagnosed with IRIS, however he was given oral prednisolone, 75 mg beginning 
on 11 Dec 2014 as a preventative against IRIS (previously reported information indicated the patient had IRIS 
symptoms). As of 17 Jun 2015, the outcome of the event IRIS was assessed as clinically recovered, however not 
recovered per MRI. Causality for IRIS was not assessed.
