Case number# PHHY2015NL027866, is a combined initial spontaneous report received from a nurse via company 
employee, physician via a sales representative on 03 Mar 2015, from a nurse via company employee on 04 Mar 
2015, from a nurse via Biogen Idec (MCN: 201581028477) on 11 Mar 2015 and from physician on 13 Mar 2015:
This report refers to a 37 year old male patient. The patient was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis at the age of 15 
years (presumed 2000). Past medications included Rebif (interferon beta 1a) in study context, until 2005, received 
placebo during participation in a study (unspecified) with interleukin, until 10 Oct 2006. Current condition included 
epilepsy diagnosed in Mar 2005, with status epilepticus. The patient had not used prior immunosuppressant 
therapy. Concomitant medications included Vitamin D supplement, Lamectal (lamotrigine), Pantoprazol 
(pantoprazole sodium sesquihydrate) and tamsulosine.
The patient was on Tysabri (natalizumab) (300 mg, IV, QM) for multiple sclerosis from 01 Oct 2007 to 13 Oct 2014. 
Reason of switch to Gilenya (fingolimod) was increased titer after longterm use of natalizumab. John Cunningham 
virus (JCV) test in liquor was negative, serology natalizumab antibodies in plasm was however elevated. JCV status
on 24 Sep 2014 was positive, with an index of 3.72. An MRI on 04 Aug 2014 and in Nov 2014 were normal. There 
was no lymphopenia (definitely not <0.2). The patient then received Gilenya capsule for the treatment of relapsing 
remitting multiple sclerosis from 18 Nov 2014 at an unknown dose. No MRI was performed during the washout 
period of Tysabri prior to starting Gilenya therapy (reason unknown). 
On 10 Feb 2015, nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed new vague lesion dorsal in right frontal lobe, 
suspicious of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML). It was recommended to repeat the MRI two 
weeks later. MRI of 26 Feb 2015 showed one big lesion of 3-4cm, on the MRI of two weeks before this lesion was 
1cm big. Continuously were in contact with other physician, and other city (both for second opinion). An MRI on 27 
Feb 2015 showed clear progression of lesion dorsal in right frontal lobe. No T1 low signal and MRIs were checked 
by VU Medical Centre, Amsterdam, and confirmed for PML. Lumbar puncture (LP) samples (date unknown) were 
to be shipped locally for testing (NOS). At the time of this report, the patient had no clinical symptoms. Treatment 
for the event was not provided. The physician suspected PML based on MRI scan made on 27 Feb 2015. The 
patient very likely received the diagnosis of PML and immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) on 03 
Mar 2015. The physician contacted a different physician for second opinion. The patient did not have clinical 
symptoms. Treatment with Gilenya was discontinued on 03 Mar 2015.  The next MRI was scheduled on 05 Mar 
2015, JC virus test was executed, liquor and plasma sent for examination (results would be expected within 5 
days). Differential diagnosis was still PML-IRIS (other physician and other city thought PML). 
Patient still did not had clinical symptoms and now seemed to be stable on the MRI (based on the weekly MRI 
scan). Patient was at the moment not treated for PML-IRIS, prednisone would possibly be deployed in case clinical 
symptoms come. In the meantime the patient was at home. The final diagnosis was still not set. Every Thursday an

MRI scan, next week Thursday again on 19 Mar 2015. Upon staying away of clinical symptoms and no increase of 
lesion on scan the making of the MRI scan would possibly be expanded to every other way.
The event of suspect PML was ongoing. The physician reported that the event was more probably related to 
Tysabri than Gilenya. Seriousness assessment of events PML-IRIS was upgraded based on NVS-IME list.
