Medically Significant
A neurologist spontaneously reported that a 51 year old female patient on TYSABRI (300 mg, IV, QM) for Multiple 
Sclerosis from 2009 to Feb 2014 was hospitalized from an unknown date to an unknown date for suspected 
progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) (onset unknown).  Prior MS therapies included Rebif (interferon 
beta-1a) and Copaxone (glatiramer acetate).  It was reported that the patient is "fully working" with an EDSS of 2 
(date of evaluation unknown).  The patient has been experiencing dizziness and fatigue (onset of symptoms 
unknown, reported as "lately").  An MRI from 21 Jan 2014 showed new small lesions in pons and cerebellum, 
described as "MS like".  A cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) sample was taken on 20 Feb 2014 and was positive for JCV 
DNA at 1100 copies/mL from an unknown lab.  TYSABRl was discontinued in Feb 2014 and plasma exchange 
(PLEX) was initiated (dates and number of sessions unknown).  The patient tested positive for anti-JCV antibodies

on an unknown date.  An MRI was done on 10 Mar 2014, and, at the time of this report, results were pending.  The 
outcome for the event suspected PML is unknown. The causality for the event of suspected PML was assessed as 
related.  TYSABRI therapy was discontinued.
Update 14 Mar 2014:  The neurologist provided the following additional information.  The CSF JCV PCR was 
performed in a local lab. JCV antibody index was never done. The patient received one round of PLEX on 14 Mar 
2014; a total of 5 rounds were planned.  At the time of this report, it was noted that the patient has improved and 
now has less double vision, more steady gait, and less dizziness. A follow up MRI was scheduled. Additional 
information is expected.
Update 21Apr 2014: A study investigator provided additional information. This 50 year-old female patient is enrolled
in the (b) (6)  study and received TYSABRI (300 mg, IV, QM) from 23 Nov
2009 to 19 Feb 2014. The patient was hospitalized on (b) (6)  for PML (onset (b) (6) ) and IRIS (onset 
Apr 2014). Indication for TYSABRI was relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis diagnosed in 2004.  The last TYSABRI
infusion prior to the event was administered on 30 Dec 2013. No other medical history was reported. No 
concomitant medications were reported.  The patient was JCV AB+ (date unk). The patient received TYSABRI 
treatment for over 4 years without incident or complications. Two months prior to PML diagnosis the patient 
reported worsening with increased fatigue, rotational vertigo and increased urinary incontinence. PML was verified 
following new MRI lesions in the pons and cerebellar peduncles right side, in addition to increased CSF-JCV DNA 
titer. The patient underwent a series of MRI's: 21 Jan 2014 MRI: new R pontine lesion w/out enhancement; (b) (6)  
(b) (6)  MRI: new inferior lesion w/out enhancement in R cerebellar peduncle; (b) (6)  MRI: No changes from 
prior study; (b) (6)  MRI: Increase in size of lesion in crus cerebelli (cerebellar peduncle); (b) (6)  MRI: 
contrast enhancement in crus cerebelli lesion (cerebellar peduncle); 07 Apr 2014 MRI: slight decrease in lesion size
and contrast enhancement otherwise relatively unchanged; 14 Apr 2014 MRI: Crus cerebelli dex. (Cerebellar 
peduncle) lesion slightly increased in size with lower level of contrast enhancement.
On 20 Feb 2014, the  CSFJCV DNA tested positive at 1173 copies/ml. PLEX treatment was commenced on (b) (6)
(b) (6) ,followed by 3 rounds of IV Solu-Medrol (methylprednisolone sodium succinate) for PML/ IRIS on (b) (6)
 The patient experienced worsening in clinical status with increased right sided 
paresis, ataxia, diplopia, nystagmus, rotational vertigo and unsteady gait. The patient developed IRIS (onset (b)(6)  
) approximately 4 weeks thereafter. Since have had three rounds with IV corticosteriod treatment, the patient's 
clinical status is primarly stable and unchanged. The patient is currently hospitalized. The investigator considered 
the PML related to TYSABRI. The causality of the IRIS to TYSABRI is unknown.  The outcome of the events was 
not yet recovered. TYSABRI was permanently discontinued on 19 Feb 2014.
Update 01 May 2014:  Biogen Idec considers this case to be confirmed for PML.

Update 30 Jun 2014: Additional information was received from a physician via a MS Standardized PML Data 
Collection Tool and medical records. The patient had a positive anti-JCV antibody status result on 03 Oct 2012. The
most recent lumbar puncture was performed on 20 Feb 2014 (previously reported). She underwent a total of five 
PLEX sessions from (b) (6)  to (b) (6) . Reportedly, the patient experienced an allergic reaction on day one of 
PLEX and received Polamarin 2 mg x 4. She received high dose steroids 1000 mg IV from 28 Mar to 01 Apr 2014 
and from 08 Apr to 12 Apr 2014. On 04 Apr 2014, she started continuous prednisolon 60 mg PO, which was 
reduced to 55 mg on 06 Jun 2014. Additional medications included Calsigran forte for osteoporosis prevention, 
Zantac 150 mg PO for ulcer prevention, Afipran for vertigo with nausea, Magnesium-C vitamin, Propolis, vitamins B
and C, and ginger. She received Zovirax 5% cream (started 15 Apr 2014) for approximately one to two weeks for 
genital herpes. A series of MRIs were performed on the following dates (awaiting translation of reports): (b) (6)  
(b) (6)  29 Apr, 06 May, 14 May, 20 May, 28 May, and 05 Jun 2014. The patient remained in the hospital as of (b) (6)
(b) (6)  Causality for the event of PML was assessed as related to TYSABRI.
Update 14 Jul 2014: Translation of head MRI reports was received:
21 Jan 2014: T1 diffusion weighted hemosiderin sequence. The supratentorial region was unchanged. In the T2-
weighted series cranial and left in the pons, and to the right in the pedunculus cerebelli there were small spotted 
areas of high intensity signal changes, which were not there on the last scan, indicating small MS changes. 
Changes in in the right pedunculus cerebelli were seen on the 'de' diffusion series, but finding was uncertain.
11 Mar 2014: Increased signal changes in right pedunculus cerebelli and also more clear signal changes in pons, 
strong suspicion of viral activation in the area. Small new high intensity signal changes in pons.
07 Apr 2014: The known lesion in right crus cerebelli further increased in size; measured 2.7 cm compared to 2.4 
cm at the last investigation. There was contrast loading in the lesion, but less than previously which may indicate 
less inflammation in the region. Other than the mentioned changes the investigation reveals no other changes.
14 Apr 2014: Known lesion in right crus cerebelli increased in size compared to previous investigation. Contrast 
loading is possibly a bit less. No further changes.
22 Apr 2014: A little less contrast loading in the lesion in the right crus cerebelli, otherwise unchanged.
29 Apr 2014: Further regression of contrast loading in the lesion in cerebellum, otherwise unchanged.
06 May 2014: New contrast loading of small lesion in pons, otherwise unchanged.
14 May 2014: Unchanged number and size of lesions. No certain contrast loading in the large lesion in the right 
cerebellum and crus cerebelli today. Regression of spotted contrast loading in pons.
20 May 2014: Unchanged when compared with previous investigation. No new lesions. Known lesions have not 
changed in size. After administration of contrast spotted contrast loading in crus cerebri on the left side are 
observed. Also some speckled lesions in left crus cerebelli. There is no contrast loading in the lesion in the right 
crus cerebelli. No other certain contrast loading.
28 May 2014: Unchanged from last investigation, no contrast loading in the large lesion in crus cerebelli on the right
side. No new changes.

05 Jun 2014: No changes in the number of T2 high intensity signal lesions with respect to size or number. Less 
contrast loading in several lesions, but two seems to be unchanged.
Additionally, volumes for each PLEX session performed 13 - 17 Mar 2014 were provided: PLEX 1: 4160 mL; PLEX 
2: 2200 mL; PLEX 3: 2300 mL; PLEX 4: 4500 mL; PLEX 5: 4500 mL.
Update 09 Oct 2014: Additional information was received from a physician via a MS Standardized PML Data 
Collection Tool. The patient is alive, residing at home, and is not currently on any MS therapy. The neurologist 
assessed the patient?s estimated Karnofsky and EDSS scores on 18 Aug 2014 to be 90 (able to carry on normal 
activity: minor signs or symptoms of disease) and 2.0.  Test results post-PML included a leukocyte count of 13.2 
x10^9/L (reference range 3.5-11.0) on 10 Jun 2014. The most recent brain MRI was on 18 Aug 2014, regression of 
changes in right crus cerebelli, otherwise unchanged.  The patient has been diagnosed with immune reconstitution 
inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) determined by clinical symptoms and MRI findings.  Clinical symptoms of IRIS 
include motor multifocal right hemiparesis (onset 20 Mar 2014); visual symptoms characterized by reduced acuity 
and diplopia (onset 20 Mar 2014); cerebellar symptoms characterized by horizontal nystagmus, broad based/ ataxic
gait, and vertigo (onset 20 Mar 2014); and sensory multifocal symptoms characterized by left hemisensory deficit 
with numbness (onset 20 Mar 2014).  The patient did not receive corticosteroids pre-IRIS onset.  The patient 
received the following corticosteroids post-IRIS onset: Solu-Medrol one gr, IV, once per day from 28 Mar 2014 to 01
Apr 2014; prednisolone 60 mg PO, once per day from 02 Apr 2014 to 03 Jun 2014; and prednisolone (gradual 
tapering down with 5 mg/ week until dosage of 20 mg) 20 mg, PO, once per day, since 04 Jun 2014.  The patient 
has not recovered (noted as "recovering") from PML and has recovered from IRIS as of 18 Aug 2014. Causality for 
the events was assessed as related to TYSABRI.
Update 20 Nov 2014:  At a visit on 21 Oct 2014 the patient was found to be "doing great" and was considering 
returning to work.  The patient had only sparse sensory symptoms characterized by vision disturbances.  The 
patient's EDSS was assessed at 2 and Karnofsky score at 90.  The patient's leukocyte count was 11.8x10^9/L 
(reference range 3.5 to 11), however it was noted that the patient had levels of "up to 14x10^9/L" during TYSABRl 
treatment.  The patient's steroid (NOS) treatment ended on 14 Sep [2014].  An MRI from 21 Oct 2014 showed GD 
enhancing lesion on T2 that had increased in size since the last MRI, assessed as an MS lesion and not PML 
related.
Update 19 Mar 2015: Additional information was received from a neurologist via a MS Standardized PML Data 
Collection Tool. To avoid MS disease activity coming back after PML and IRIS were resolved, the subject received 
a gradual tapering of steroids with prednisolone 20 mg daily being given for a longer period from 04 Jun 2014. 
When the prednisolone was stopped, the MS disease activity came back. MRI performed 21 Oct 2014 showed 
increase in size of existing T2 lesion with partial upload.  The subject presented to the hospital on (b) (6)
reporting symptoms of unsteadiness, difficulties concentrating and fatigue. New MR images taken (b) (6)

showed two new contrast enhancing lesions, one in the pons and one in the frontal left side. These new lesions 
corresponded to the symptoms the subject was experiencing. The subject was admitted from (b) (6)  to(b)(6)  
(b) (6)  receiving SoluMedrol treatment course for the attack. Due to the increased MS disease activity, the 
subject was started on fingolimod (Gilenya) on 22 Dec 2014 for clinical relapse and radiological evidence of return 
of MS. On (b) (6)  the subject was admitted again receiving a new SoluMedrol treatment course.  New MR 
images taken the day of admittance, (b) (6)  showed four (4) new contrast enhancing lesions. On (b) (6)  
(b) (6)  the neurologist assessed the subject?s estimated Karnofsky and EDSS scores to be 90 (able to carry on 
normal activity; minor signs or symptoms of disease) and 2.5, respectively. Laboratory analysis performed (b) (6)  
(b) (6)  showed low lymphocyte count (0.1 x 10(9)/L) and fingolimod was temporarily stopped on 11 Mar 2015 
according to SPC for fingolimod. New laboratory analysis taken at general practitioner (GP) on 12 Mar 2015 
showed lymphocyte count of 0.8 x 10(9)/L. The lymphocyte count is to be followed weekly at the GP?s office. The 
images from (b) (6)  were reviewed with a second opinion on 16 Mar 2015 and the results were the same 
there in that there were four new contrast-enhancing lesions. Currently, the subject is alive and is residing at home. 
As of 18 Aug 2014, the subject has recovered from PML and has recovered from IRIS. Causality of the events was 
assessed as related to TYSABRI.
Update 11 May 2015: Additional information was received from a neurologist via a MS Standardized PML Data 
Collection Tool. The patient is alive, residing at home and currently taking Gilenya (fingolimod) due to clinical 
relapse and radiological evidence of return of Multiple Sclerosis. The patient has been referred for further 
evaluation on whether other experimental treatment would be suitable for this patient. The patient has since the 12 
month DCT was reported (19 Mar 2015) travelled to Thailand on own initiative to receive stem-cell injections in 
blood and spinal tract without initial chemo-treatment. The treating neurologist had not been involved in this 
decision and did currently not have more information. Patient was scheduled for a new visit at site on 01 Jun 2015. 
As of 18 Aug 2014, the subject has recovered from PML and IRIS. Causality of events was assessed as related to 
TYSABRI.
Update 26 May 2015:  A neurologist provided the following additonial information via a slide presentation.  Previous 
medical history included hysterectomy, kidney stone, and recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs).  MS specific 
history included unsteadiness and numbness in both legs in Apr 2004, double vision, unable to notice urge to pee, 
and reduced sensibility in the pelvic area in Jun 2004, and reduced gait, and significant parestesis in the right foot 
with increased reflexes, unsteady walking on a line in Oct 2004. A spinal tap (date unknown) and CSF analysis 
(date unknown) showed 9 cells, total protein of 0.21 g/L, and oligoclonal band <10.  An MRI in Apr (year not 
reported) showed less than 30 typical MS lesions, most contrast enhancing, 3 in cervical medulla (2 contrast 
enhancing).  An MRI in Jun (year not reported) showed regress of lesions, none that were new contrast enhancing. 
The patient was subsequently diagnosed with MS in 2004.  Following the diagnosis of MS the patient had 3 hospital
admissions in 2004, and between 2007 and 2009 one to two annual admissions.  Prior MS therapy included Rebif
