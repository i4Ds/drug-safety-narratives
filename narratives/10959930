A neurologist spontaneously reported that a  female patient on TYSABRI (300 mg, IV, QM) for Multiple Sclerosis 
from 09 Oct 2009 to 07 Apr 2011 and from 30 Jan 2012 to 14 Jan 2015 was hospitalized on (b) (6)  for 
confirmed PML (Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy, onset (b) (6) ). Patient first started TYSABRI in 
Oct 2009 and was off TYSABRI for about a year because she was pregnant in 2011. TYSABRI was resumed 
postpartum in Mar 2012. The patient had missed a couple of doses due to her illness. Her first symptoms 
presented in(b) (6)  She was having psychiatric issues and went to the Psychiatry emergency room and was 
admitted to a facility near her home after. She worsened clinically and an urgent MRI scan on (b) (6)
showed suspicious new activity. On(b) (6)  she was tested positive for JCV DNA and was admitted to the 
hospital. Last dose of TYSABRI was in Jan 2015 and there were no plans to resume the therapy. The patient 
received PLEX and was under care for PML management.  An infusion nurse spontaneously reported via phone 
that the neurologist had confirmed PML via MRI and lumbar puncture performed at his local laboratory. The event 
is ongoing and the causality was not reported. TYSABRI therapy is discontinued.
Update 13 Mar 2015: Upon receipt of follow-up clinic notes from 17 Feb 2015 from the reporting neurologist, it was 
reported that the patient was being treated with monthly TYSABRI infusions for Relapsing-Remitting Multiple 
Sclerosis since 2011 and she was last seen at the clinic in Aug 2014. She first presented in 2009 with nausea, 
vomiting, dizziness, and imbalance. MRIs at that time showed multiple demyelinating lesions throughout her brain 
and spinal cord, several of which were enhancing.  She was treated with Solu-Medrol (Methylprednisolone sodium 
succinate; from 2009 to unknown date) and Avonex (30 UG, IM, QW from Apr 2009 to Aug 2009). After several 
months, however, her symptoms continued to worsen and had progression on her MRI. Thus, she was started on 
TYSABRI (300 mg, IV, QM) in Oct 2009.  She was off TYSABRI for about a year from Apr 2011 to Jan 2012 
because she was pregnant. During that time she was clinically and radiographically stable.  The patient was then 
tested positive for JC virus antibody on 24 May 2011, but she elected to continue TYSABRI therapy because of its 
effectiveness. At her last visit in Aug 2014, she was clinically stable. A discussion was held regarding the possibility 
of transitioning to an oral agent for Multiple Sclerosis, but the patient pushed to continue with TYSABRI and repeat 
MRI's were recommended to occur prior to the end of year 2014 for surveillance.  In fall 2014, the patient 
experienced worsening depression and amotivation, followed by thoughts of self-harm, and ultimately culminated in
her being taken to Psychiatry Emergency Department on (b) (6)  The patient was then hospitalized and 
discharged on (b) (6)  The patient felt improved, but her family was concerned about her ongoing depressive 
symptoms. Except psychiatric issues, the patient did not have new symptoms except generalized fatigue. There 
were no new bladder or bowel issues, no concerns for seizures or headache. The patient received her last 
TYSABRI infusion on 14 Jan 2015.  Concomitant medications included Xanax (alprazolam), Zoloft (sertraline), 
Remeron (mirtazapine), and Ambien (zolpidem). The patient had clinical deterioration, and a brain MRI was 
performed on 24 Feb 2015 that showed new areas of signal abnormality noted involving the right thalamus, right 
basal ganglia and the right frontal lobe without definite post-contrast enhancement and also within the left, dominant
left medial thalamus. Other multiple areas of signal abnormality involving the posterior fossa structures and also

within bilateral cerebral hemispheric white matter noted as before consistent with known demyelinating process (in 
comparison to brain MRI on 20 Dec 2013).  The neurologist felt that the MRI findings were consistent with PML and
the changes were significant in comparison to her older MRI's. The patient was hospitalized on (b) (6)  for 
PML suspicion and a lumbar puncture was performed, processed by the local labs and CSF had 800 copies/ml of 
JCV DNA. 
Update 13 Mar 2015: Upon receipt of the standardized MS Data Collection Tool from the neurologist, it was 
reported that the patient was being evaluated for PML based on the clinical signs and symptoms and MRI findings 
suspicious of PML.  The Multiple Sclerosis symptoms prior to suspected PML included left sided tingling in 2006; 
and vertigo, nausea, and gait imbalance in Nov 2008.  Patient's past immunomodulatory therapy for Multiple 
Sclerosis included Solu-Medrol (Methylprednisolone sodium succinate; from 2009 to unknown date) and Avonex 
(30 UG, IM, QW from Apr 2009 to Aug 2009). The patient did not receive any immunosuppressant therapy in the 
past. In Jan 2015, the patient presented cognitive signs and symptoms including worsening depression, anhedonia,
and confusion that led to the evaluation for possible PML.  On 01 Jan 2009, laboratory testing included leukocyte 
count 4.0 K/mm3 (reference range= 4.0-10.0 K/mm3) prior to starting TYSABRI therapy, on 24 May 2011, the 
patient was tested positive for anti-JCV antibody, on 20 Dec 2013 a brain MRI was performed (results not 
provided), on 02 Feb 2015, test results included leukocyte count 10.6 K/mm3 (reference range= 4.0-10.0 K/mm3), 
lymphocyte count 31.5% (reference range= 20.0-50.0%), absolute lymphocyte count 3.3 K/mm3 (reference range= 
1.5-7.2 K/mm3); on 03 Mar 2015, test results included leukocyte count 8.5 K/mm3 (reference range= 4.0-10.0 
K/mm3), lymphocyte count 37.7% (reference range= 20.0-50.0%), absolute lymphocyte count 3.2 K/mm3 
(reference range= 1.5-7.2 K/mm3); on (b) (6)  a lumbar puncture was performed at the local lab and the CSF
had 800 copies/ml of JCV DNA; on (b) (6)  CSF analysis findings were: White blood cells= 1/mm3, Red 
blood cells= 6/mm3, Protein= 52 mg/dL, Glucose= 53 mg/dL (reference ranges not provided) . Treatment for PML 
included 3 PLEX (Plasma Exchange) sessions on(b) (6) (b) (6)  and, (b) (6) . PML treatment 
medications also included Mirtazapine and Corticosteroids (NOS). At the time of this report, the patient was 
hospitalized, being monitored for IRIS (Immune Reconstitution Inflammatory Syndrome) and the neurologist stated 
she was stable. The event of confirmed PML is ongoing. The causality was assessed as related to TYSABRI by the
reporting neurologist. At the time of this report, the TOUCH database indicated that the patient had received 52 
infusions of TYSABRl from 09 Oct 2009 to 14 Jan 2015. TYSABRI therapy was discontinued.
Update 19 Mar 2015: Upon internal review, Biogen considers this case to be confirmed for PML based on positive 
CSF, consistent radiological findings, and clinical symptoms.
Update 28 Apr 2015: The neurologist reported via MS TOUCH Prescribing Program Discontinuation Questionnaire 
that the patient died (date of death not provided). The cause of death is unknown. The causality for the event of 
death was not assessed. TYSABRI therapy was discontinued.

Update 06 May 2015: Upon a return correspondence from the neurologist, it was reported that the patient died on 
(b) (6)  and was under home hospice case at the time of her death. The patient had been hospitalized from (b)(6)
 to (b) (6)  when her condition first took a major turn for the worse. The neurologist did not hear about
patient's death until several days later. They were unaware about who actually signed the death certificate or what 
was listed as the official cause of death. Cause of death is unknown. Causality was not assessed. Patient's family 
elected not to have an autopsy done.
