MEDICALLY SIGNIFICANT
On 23 Dec 2013
A neurologist spontaneously reported that a 39 year old male patient on TYSABRI (IV, 300 mg, QM) for multiple 
sclerosis since 01 Aug 2007 presented with PML suspicion base on brain MRI results. 
The patient had no history of immunosuppressive agent use. Most recent brain MRI revealed a large space-
occupying lesion very suggestive of PML whereas the patient was asymptomatic. No further information was 
provided.

Number (b) (6) . It involved a 39 year old male subject (ID (b) (6) / Initials:(b)(6) ).
The subject showed first signs of Multiple sclerosis in Feb 2001 and was diagnosed with MS in Oct 2001. The 
subject's prior therapies included Rebif (interferon beta-1a) and Copaxone (glatiramer acetate). The subject's past 
medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. 
The subject received his first dose of commercially available TYSABRI (300mg, IV monthly) on 01 Aug 2007 and 
subsequently enrolled in (b) (6)   At the time of the event in Dec 2013, the subject had received a total of 81 
TYSABRI doses, with his last dose on 23 Nov 2013.
A brain MRI, performed on 18 Dec 2013 showed an extension of a T2 lesion to the anterior temporal and insular 
regions (both on the right side), without Gadolinium enhancement. A previous MRI, performed on 24 Sep 2013, had
shown a Gadolinium-negative hyper T2 lesion in the right internal parieto-occipital region (it was only identified a 
posteriori). These lesions were considered suggestive of PML. On an unspecified date, the subject tested positive 
for JCV antibodies (STRATIFY). A lumbar puncture was performed on 19 Dec 2013 and was positive for JCV DNA 
containing 57,380 copies/ml.  The CSF sample further contained 1 cell/mm3, protein 0.18 g/L, chloride 129 mmol/L 
and glucose (CSF) 1.42 g/L. Blood glucose at the same time was 0.87 g/L. On 01 Aug 2007 the EDSS was 3.0; on 
06 Sep 2013: EDSS 2.5; on 18 Dec 2013: EDSS 2.5. The Karnofsky score was 80 on 01 Aug 2007, on 06 Sep 
2013 and on 18 Dec 2013. Plasma exchange was performed on 20 Dec 2013 and on 26 Dec 2013. At the time of 
this report, the subject was asymptomatic. On 27 Dec 2013 he was at home with no need of support. The 
investigator considered the event to be confirmed for PML.
At the time of this report the event was ongoing.
As a result of this serious adverse event, TYSABRI was stopped (to be confirmed).
The investigator considered the event related to TYSABRI
Additional information was expected.
Update 02 Jan 2013: Biogen Idec considers this case to be confirmed for PML based on the MRI details and 
positive CSF.
Update 16 Apr 2014: Additional information received from the investigator who provided MRI images showed an 
asymptomatic lesion in Dec 2013, which was already visible on an MRI from Sep 2013.

Update 24 July 2014: Additional information was received from a neurologist via a MS Standardized PML Data 
Collection Tool. The subject is alive, residing at home, and is not currently on any MS therapy. On 09 July 2014, the
neurologist assessed the subject s estimated Karnofsky and EDSS scores to be 60 (requires occasional 
assistance, but is able to care for most of his personal needs) and 5.0. On 09 July 2014, a brain MRI was 
performed (images provided). The subject was diagnosed with IRIS, which was determined by clinical symptoms 
and MRI findings. On 09 January 2014, the subject initiated treatment with Cortancyl (prednisone) 60 mg PO daily 
with dose tapering (30 mg in Apr 2014, 10 mg in June 2014). He was also treated with Solumedrol 
(methylprednisolone) 1 GM IV daily from 23 January to 25 January 2014. Onset date of IRIS symptoms was 25 
January 2014 and included the following: cognitive/ behavioral (dysfunction of mental processing), focal motor (left 
hemiparesia), visual (left lateral hemianopsia), and focal sensory (left heminegligence). As of April 2014, the subject
has recovered from PML and IRIS. Causality for the events was assessed as related to TYSABRI.
Update 02 February 2015: Additional information was received from a physician via a MS Standardized PML Data 
Collection Tool. The subject is alive, residing at home, and is not currently on any MS therapy.The physician 
assessed the subject's estimated Karnofsky score on 30 January 2015 to be 60 (requires occasional assistance, 
but is able to care for most of his personal needs). A brain MRI was performed on 16 October 2014 with results 
reported as follows: appearance unchanged of the many punctiform tumours in DIR hypersignal, FLAIR, located 
within the cerebral trunk, in the white matter of the semi-oval centres, bilateral parietal, fronto-insular and right inner
temporal, consistent with PMLE tumours; noted slight reduction in uptake of contrast by PMLE tumours. No newly 
appeared uptake of contrast. In addition, appearance of rest of examination unchanged. Tumoral stability. A brain 
MRI was performed on 15 December 2014 with results reported as follows: distribution and appearance of tumours 
in white matter stable. No new tumours. Persistence of punctiform increases in right semi-oval centre, right peri-
ventricular and right inner parietal sub-corticals, the progression of which is difficult to judge due to the different 
techniques. As of 30 January 2015, the subject has not recovered from PML (discrepant from previous report). The 
subject has recovered from IRIS as of 16 May 2014. Causality for the events of PML and IRIS was assessed as 
related to TYSABRI.
Update 09 Sep 2015: A report was received from literature.  Hodel J, Outteryck O, Verclytte S, Deramecourt V, 
Lacour A, Pruvo J-P, Vermersch P, and Leclerc X.  Brain magnetic susceptibility changes in patients with 
natalizumab-associated progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy.  American Journal of Neuroradiology; 27 Aug 
2015.  doi: 10.3174/ajnr.A4436.  This case is in reference to patient number 8, a 39 year old male patient.  The 
patient was exposed to TYSABRI for a total of 79 months.  On an unknown date, the patient's cerebrospinal fluid 
(CSF) was positive for JCV DNA.  The patient had 10 available MRIs (dates and results not reported), covering the 
"symptomatic to chronic stage".  The patient did have susceptibility weighted imaging.  The patient also had T2 
weighted imaging.  The subject had one PML lesion located in the right temporal lobe and adjacent to basal 
ganglia.  For the lesion located in the right temporal lobe, there was no low-signal intensity within the U-fibers and

there was low-signal in the deep gray matter, specifically the right lenticular nucleus and substantia nigra.  The time 
of detection of the susceptibility-weighted signal abnormality was noted as " symptomatic and after".  The subject 
also had a PML lesion located in the right frontal lobe which was not adjacent to the basal ganglia. For the second 
lesion, there was low-signal intensity within the U-fibers and there was no low-signal in the deep gray matter. The 
time of detection of the susceptibility-weighted signal abnormality was noted as "chronic".  The FLAIR and SWI in 
patient 8 were reported at symptomatic and chronic stages. At the symptomatic stage, an extensive PML lesion 
was visible on FLAIR images involving the right frontal and temporal white matter and the brain stem. The low 
signal intensity of the right lenticular nucleus on FLAIR images was noted. At the chronic stage, the SWI sequence 
revealed decreased signal-intensity of the right substantia nigra compared with the left. SWI minimal-intensity-
projection view confirmed this pattern of asymmetric hypointensity involving the right lenticular nucleus and 
substantia nigra, adjacent to the PML lesion.
