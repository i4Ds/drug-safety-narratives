A hospital neurologist spontaneously reported via a Biogen employee (field force) that a 47 year old female patient 
on TYSABRI (300 mg, IV, QM) for relapsing remitting Multiple Sclerosis from 15 May 2008 to 13 Jan 2015 was 
hospitalized (dates not provided) for suspicion of PML (onset 10 Apr 2015). The patient received a total of 86 doses
of TYSABRI.  Previous MS therapy included interferon beta-1b which was discontinued due to severe repeated MS 
relapses and significant worsening of MS.  Medical history included arterial hypertension and COPD.  Concomitant 
medications included amlodipine and Symbicort (budesonide and formoterol).  Following benefit-risk assessment 
and taking into consideration positive anti-JCV antibody test (date unknown) as well as stable course of underlying 
disease during the TYSABRI therapy, TYSABRI therapy was discontinued.   On 18 Mar 2015, the patient 
commenced fingolimod. On 10 Apr 2015, the first routine brain MRI examination under fingolimod was performed 
and showed extended confluating and partly patchy lesions in the frontal and fronto-basal regions more pronounced

on the right side as well as in the profound white matter and periventricular regions on both sides characterized by 
significant brain-blood-barrier disruption. There were no clinical symptoms noted at that time. Fingolimod was 
temporarily discontinued and plasmapheresis was performed.  Several lumbar punctures were done and repeated 
CSF JCV DNA tests returned negative. Following careful consideration and repeated patient clarification, fingolimod
therapy was re-started on 22 Apr 2015.  On 22 May 2015, new follow up routine brain MRI revealed slight 
progression of pathological findings still in the absence of clinical symptoms.  Another lumbar puncture was 
performed (date unknown) and CSF JCV DNA test again returned negative.  However, anti-JCV antibody specify 
index (JCV-ASI) was significantly increased on (b) (6)   Fingolimod was withdrawn and the patient was 
scheduled for admission on (b) (6)   The outcome for the event suspicion of PML is unknown. The causality 
for the event of suspicion of PML was assessed as possibly related.  TYSABRI therapy was discontinued. 
Update 15 Jun 2015:  Additional information was provided by the hospital neurologist within the scope of the 
suspect DCT.  The patient was not enrolled in any TYSABRI study. The patient continued to be asymptomatic (no 
clinical signs of PML).  Medical history included MS diagnosed in Dec 2007 characterized by mild ataxia while 
"tightrope walking", mild paresis and positive pyramidal signs on the right side and somewhat increased MEP on 
the right side. The patient had never been treated with immunosuppressive therapy. Routine MRI had been 
performed every 6 months. The patient had tested positive for anti-JCV antibodies on 13 Jul 2011, index value was 
not known. There were no relevant concurrent diseases and no concomitant medication in this patient. Laboratory 
test results were reported as follows: prior to start of TYSABRI, on 22 Apr 2008, WBC was 5.9 G/l, lymphocytes 
were 1.58 G/l, and lymphocyte percentage was 26.9 pct; on TYSABRI prior to suspicion of PML, on 18 Mar 2015, 
WBC was 10.7 G/l, lymphocytes were 3.58 G/l, and lymphocyte percentage was 33.3 pct; at the time of suspicion of
PML, on 10 Apr 2015, WBC was 7.1 G/l, lymphocytes were 0.91 G/l, lymphocyte percentage was 12.9 pct (normal 
ranges not provided).  CSF anti-JCV specificity (JCV-ASI) index value was 10.3 (presume in reference to previously
reported index which significantly increased on (b) (6) ).  Brain MRI performed on 22 May 2015 (previously 
reported) revealed significant BBB disruption as well as extended confluating partly patchy or punctiform fronto-
basal lesions bilaterally more pronounced on the right side reaching up to profound white matter and periventricular 
region. Further MRI examination was performed on (b) (6)  results were still pending. As previously reported, 
repeated CSF JCV DNA tests had returned negative. These tests were performed on 10 Apr 2015, 21 Apr 2015 
and 26 May 2015, all of them by the Lab (b) (6)   The most recent lumbar puncture was done on (b)(6)
 with following findings: 7 cells, protein 538 mg/l, oligoclonal bands type B identified. The sample was sent 
for JCV DNA testing to (b) (6)  on (b) (6)  results were still pending.  Treatment of the event included five 
cycles of plasmapheresis performed from 10 Apr 2015 to 20 Apr 2015 and again five cycles of plasmapheresis 
starting on (b) (6)  and still ongoing as well as mirtazapine 30 mg QD from (b) (6)  to (b) (6)  which 
was increased to daily dose to 60 mg started on (b) (6)  The patient still remained hospitalized at the time of 
reporting.

Update 25 Jun 2015: The neurologist reported that also the fourth CSF JCV DNA PCR taken on (b) (6)  and 
sent to (b) (6)  on (b) (6)  showed negative results. The cranial MRI on (b) (6)  showed in comparison to
the previous MRI a slight improvement of the findings concerning the extended fronto-parietal edematous area on 
the right side. The contrast medium enhancements inside the lesion were slightly regressing. Otherwise no other 
new aspects resulted from the comparison with the previous MRI.
Update 14 Aug 2015:  Additional information was provided by the hospital neurologist.  The treating neurologist 
continued to suspect PML in this patient, despite CSF JCV DNA being negative both at (b) (6)  and Lab (b) (6)  
 (previously reported).  To clarify the diagnosis, a brain biopsy was performed on (b) (6)   Results 
showed IRIS (onset unknown) within the scope of most likely PML, and in which no JCV-infected cells could be 
proven in the tissue.  The infected tissue was sent for examination (results unknown).  The neurologists continued 
to assume PML in this patient.  Differential diagnostic considerations included IRIS within the scope of a severe 
rebound effect following discontinuation of natalizumab (onset not provided; presume onset of suspect PML: 10 Apr
2015).  The patient continued to be clinically stable and largely was neurologically without pathological findings.
According to the neurologist, the causal relationship to natalizumab and fingolimod, respectively, seemed to be 
probable.  A further causal differentiation could not definitively be made.  Causality for the IRIS and IRIS within the 
scope of a severe rebound effect following discontinuation of natalizumab was not provided.
Update 07 Sep 2015:  Additional information was provided by the hospital neurologist via a Biogen Medical Science
Liaison (MSL).  Result from the examination of the brain tissue performed at a local lab which was negative 
(previously reported) was sent to (b) (6)  and assessed as positive (presume for JCV DNA infected cells).  As a result, 
the neurologist confirmed the diagnosis of PML.  The patient remained in good clinical condition and did not show 
clinical abnormalities.
Update 10 Sep 2015:  Upon internal review, the case has been confirmed for PML based on positive brain biopsy 
and consistent radiological findings.
Update 30 Nov 2015: Additional information was received from a neurologist via a MS Standardized PML Data 
Collection Tool. At the time of PML diagnosis (+/- three months) the patient's height was 170 centimeters and 
weight was 82 kilograms. Karnofsky and EDSS scores were assessed in May 2008 (prior to starting suspect 
product) to be 60 (requires occasional assistance, but is able to care for most personal needs) and 5.5, and on 18 
Mar 2015 (on suspect product prior to PML) and on 10 Apr 2015 (at time of PML diagnosis) to be 90 (able to carry 
on normal activity; minor signs or symptoms of disease) and 2.5. Lumbar punctures were performed on 10 Apr 
2015, 22 Apr 2015, 22 May 2015, and (b) (6)  with negative CSF JCV DNA results. Test results post PML 
diagnosis included: 10 Apr 2015 WBC of 7.10 g/L (normal range 4.4 - 11.3), lymphocyte of 12.90 percent (normal 
range 25 - 40), absolute lymphocyte count of 0.91 g/L (normal range 1 - 4); (b) (6)  - biopsy with JC multiples q

PCR of paraffin embedded brain tissue of 1094 copies /10 ml extract (normal range < 10 copies/ 10 ml. The patient
was diagnosed with IRIS (onset 10 Apr 2015) and symptoms included worsening latent hemiparesis right side, 
contrast enhancements on MRI at time of IRIS, and mass effect or edema on MRI. The patient had not received 
corticosteroids pre-IRIS or post-IRIS. Treatment for IRIS included the following: PLEX 5 cycles every 2nd day from 
11 Apr 2015 to 21 Apr 2015 (post-IRIS) and PLEX 5 cycles every 2nd day from (b) (6)  to (b) (6)  (post-
IRIS). Karnofsky and EDSS scores were assessed on 13 Jul 2015 (three months post PML) to be 90 (able to carry 
on normal activity; minor signs or symptoms of disease) and 3.0. MRI performed on (b) (6)  indicated extended
confluent and patchy enhancing lesions in both frontal lobes with significant right-sided emphasis. The neurologist 
assessed the patient on 11 Sept 2015 to be recovered from PML and recovered with sequelae from IRIS. Causality 
of PML was assessed as related. Causality was not assessed for IRIS. At the time of this report, the patient was 
alive, residing at home, and on Copaxone (glatiramer) therapy since 26 Aug 2015.
