cardiac hypertrophy and pulmonary congestion were not observed and electrocardiogram (ECG) showed normal. 
The cause of death was reported as pneumonia. No autopsy was performed. The following differential 
examinations and corrective therapy were not performed: respiratory function test, echocardiogram, 
bronchoalvecilar lavage (BAt.), biopsy, sputum culture, drug lymphocyte stimulation test (DLST), fibrin degradation 
product (FDP), D-dieter, fibrinogen, Krebs von den kungen-6 (KL-6.), pulmonary surfactant protein (SP-D), 
administration of steroid. Attempted to obtain lot/control number,   o   alien was unknown. The investigator 
considered that the causality between the pneumonia and study drugs was unknown and the Pit decreased was 
related to study 0   t. . No further information was expected. Case closed. Audit trail:  0  .0  -up information
