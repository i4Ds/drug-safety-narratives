NON-CELGENE NONINTERVENTIONAL TRIAL (USA): A Non-Celgene Sponsored Non-Interventional Trial
Initial information was received on 23/Jun/2015 from the investigator regarding a Non-Celgene Sponsored Non-
Interventional Trial. This information is in regard to a 65 year-old female, (Site number unspecified, Subject number
(b) (6) ), who initiated study medication Abraxane, cycle 1, 150mg/m2, intravenous on days 1, 8 and 15 for 
Hodgkins lymphoma. Relevant medical history included autologous stem cell transplantation. Concomitant 
medication included Acyclovir, acetaminophen, oxycodone, prednisone, gabapentin and esomeprazole. Previous 
therapies included R-CHOP (rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisone), ICE (Ifosfamide, 
carboplatin and etoposide), BEAM ASCT (carmustine, etoposide, cytarabine and melphalan), brentuximab, GVD 
(gemcitabine, vinorelbine and doxorubicin) and everolimus.

FOIA Case Report Information
On (b) (6)  the patient developed weakness (NCI-CTC Grade unspecified) and was hospitalized. The patient 
presented to the emergency department with complaints of weakness and was subsequently admitted for 
evaluation. On (b) (6)  the white blood cell count was 39.4, hemoglobin 11.4, platelets 348 and absolute 
neutrophil count 38.4 (units and reference ranges not provided). A brain magnetic resonance imaging was 
conducted and showed a subacute infarct of the motor cortex which could possibly explain the patient's weakness. 
The patient reported that her strength was improving during her admission. 
Diagnostic and laboratory tests showed the following:
On (b) (6)  blood cultures were negative
On (b) (6)  a lumbar puncture was negative
On (b) (6)  an echocardiogram and a carotid doppler were negative.
The action taken with the Abraxane was unknown.  The outcome for the weakness was recovering. The patient 
was discharged on (b) (6)
The investigator assessed the causal relationship as follows:
Weakness: Abraxane; (Not related)
The company concurs with the reported. Additional information will be requested from the prescriber.
INVESTIGATOR SAE VERBATIM: POSSIBLE PROGRESSIVE MULTIFOCAL LEUKOENCEPHALOPATHY
Additional information was received on 16/Jul/2015 from the investigator. Abraxane therapy dates were amended to
15/Apr/2015 to 27/May/2015. Additional concomitant medication included Nasonex. 
After being discharged on (b) (6)  patient complained of worsening left sided weakness and was readmitted 
to the hospital on (b) (6)  Repeat brain MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) on (b) (6)  showed interval 
increase in site and number of bilateral focal and confluent cerebral FLAI hyperintense lesions and tiny enhancing 
punctuate lesions. The results strongly favored progressing lymphoma. Patient underwent a needle biopsy of the 
brain lesion on (b) (6)  Results from the brain biopsy and paraneoplastic antibodies were still pending at the 
time of this report. The findings were most consistent with progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy at the time 
of this report. The event was considered life threatening by the investigator. Final confirmation of this diagnosis was
yet to come back.
Overall, action taken with Abraxane was unknown. Outcome of the event was not provided.

FOIA Case Report Information
The investigator assessed the causal relationship as follows:
Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy: Abraxane (not provided)
Celgene assessed the relationship between the therapy and the event as possible. 
Additional information will be requested from the investigator.
Additional information was received on 10Aug2015 from the investigator. 
Dates of previous chemotherapy was provided as follows: The patient received R-CHOP from 19Feb2003 to 
Jun2003, ICE from 05Mar2014 to 31Mar2014, auto stem cell transplant from 29May2014 to 17Jun2014, 
Brentuximab Vedotin from 18Sep2014 to 09Oct2014, GVD from 30Oct2014 to 18Dec202014 and Everolimus from 
06Jan2015 to 22Mar2015.  Relevant medical history included rheumatoid arthritis in 2011 and occasional pain.
Indications for previously reported concomitant medications were reported as follows: Acyclovir for infection 
prophylaxis  (started on 30Jul2014; 400mg orally, 3 times daily), Prednisone of rheumatoid arthritis (started 
16Jan2015; 10mg daily), Acetaminophen for occasional pain (650mg, orally every 6 hours as needed), Oxycodone 
for occasional pain (5mg every 6 hours as needed), Gabapentin for peripheral neuropathy (started 10Jun2015, 
300mg 3 times daily), esomeprazole for indigestion prophylaxis (20mg orally daily) and Nasonex for allergies (2 
sprays daily).
The investigator confirmed that the weakness (previously reported with an onset date of (b) (6) ), was related to
the progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy.  The onset date of  the progressive multifocal 
leukoencephalopathy was updated to (b) (6)  and the event of weakness was subsumed under the event of 
progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy.  In regards to the source/cause of the progressive multifocal 
leukoencephalopathy, the investigator reported that the patient had multiple recurrent CHL (classical Hodgkin 
lymphoma), and has had several lines of therapy.  The progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy was related to 
prior chemotherapy, but was impossible to know which particular agent the event was related to.
On (b) (6)  the needle biopsy of the brain lesion confirmed the diagnosis of progressive multifocal 
leukoencephalopathy.  Treatment for the event included Methylprednisolone infusions over 5 days.
The investigator assessed the causal relationship as follows:
Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy: Abraxane (Possibly)
Celgene assessed the relationship between the therapy and the event as possible.
