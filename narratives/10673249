AER 1511366 is a non-interventional literature study case, received on 15/Dec/2014 and concerns a patient of 
unknown demographics who developed progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy while enrolled in

The study included (b) (6)  patients (n = FL, 71; MCL, 15; SMZ, 8; MALT, 9; PL, 6; iNHL NOS, 7); mean age 65.7 
years (median, 67.0). Patients aged >18 years, with a histological diagnosis of iNHL (FL, MCL, splenic marginal 
zone lymphoma [SMZ], mucosa-associated lymphoma [MALT], plasmacytic lymphoma [PL, including

Waldenstrom's lymphoma], and low-grade lymphoma not specified [iNHL NOS]), who had received at least two 
cycles of BR (minimum dose of 70 mg/m2) as first-line treatment were included. Previous R monotherapy and/or 
radiotherapy, and R maintenance following BR treatment, were allowed. Fifteen patients had previously received R 
monotherapy. After treatment with BR, CR was achieved in 56.9% of all patients, 57.7% of patients with FL, and 
46.7% of patients with MCL. CR in patients who had previously received R monotherapy was lower than in those 
who had not (40.0% vs. 60.0% respectively). ORR was 85.3% for all patients, 87.3% of patients with FL, and 66.7%
of patients with MCL. At the end of the study, 89% of patients were alive. Stem cells were harvested in four 
patients, all had >2x106/kg CD34 cells. R maintenance improved PFS. The incidence of adverse events was 
similar to previously reported trials with BR. Thirteen patients died but only two of the deaths were related to 
treatment. The remaining patients died due to progressive lymphoma (n=6), secondary malignancy (n=2), cardiac 
arrest (n=1), and other cause (n=2).
This case concerns of a patient who developed progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy. 
On an unspecified date, the patient was started on rituximab and bendamustine (dose, route, form and frequency 
not reported). It was reported that, later the patient died due to progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy. 
There was insufficient information regarding the therapy ongoing status of rituximab and bendamustine at the time 
of death. 
The author stated that, death of the two patients were related to rituximab and bendamustine treatment. 
No further information was provided.
