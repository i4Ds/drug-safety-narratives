Medically Significant
A neurologist reported that a  patient on TYSABRI (300 mg, IV, QM) for Multiple Sclerosis from 01 Aug 2010 to 
unknown date and enrolled in a Biogen Idec sponsored marketing program of Monitored Therapy experienced 
possible PML characterized by suspicious MRI (onset(b) (6) ).  The outcome for the event possible PML 
characterized by suspicious MRI is unknown. The causality for the event of possible PML characterized by 
suspicious MRI was assessed as possibly related. The patient tested positive for the anti-JCV antibody on an 
unknown date.   It is unknown if TYSABRI treatment is ongoing. The patient has recieved a total of 40 TYSABRI 
infusions.
Update 21 Jan 2014: The neurologist reported the 37 year old female patient has had 46 infusions of TYSABRI 
since Oct 2009. She was previously enrolled in the oral teriflunomide study and stopped in 2009 as she was having

attacks (NOS). The patient's most recent MRI showed new involvement in the posterior left temporal and occipital 
regions; the neurologist stated the confluent appearance of this and the quite extensive new involvement since 
recent study in May 2013 does raise the possibility that this represents PML rather than new areas of 
demyelination. The patient presented to the clinic on 08 Jan 2014 and her exam revealed new cognitive symptoms 
however as of 20 Jan 2014 the patient has been stable with some neuropsychological deficits and very mild arm 
ataxia. The patient has been hospitalized on an unknown date to receive a full course of plasmapheresis and she 
will also be receiving weekly MRI's. The patient CSF JCV PCR was JCV positive with over 4000 copies. The 
patients has been considered JCV DNA positive by(b) (6)  labs.
Update 23 Jan 2014: Per mini-trace review this case is considered to be confirmed PML based on positive JCV in 
CSF, MRI findings and clinical symptoms.
Update 06 Mar 2014: Additional information was received from the neurologist via a MS Standardized PML Data 
Collection Tool. The neurologist reported that the patient completed 52 infusions of TYSABRI (discrepant from 
previous report) since 21 Oct 2009. The neurologist assessed the patient s estimated Karnofsky score to be 60 
(requires occasional assistance, but is able to care for most of her personal needs) on an unspecified date. She 
tested positive for serum anti-JCV antibodies on 11 Jan 2012. A lumbar puncture was performed on an unspecified 
date, and the CSF sample was tested on 08 Jan 2014 (result not provided). Currently, the patient is residing at 
home. The outcome of the event of PML was not provided. Causality for the event was assessed as related to 
TYSABRI.
Update 10 Mar 2014: Upon follow-up it was determined that case CA-BIOGENIDEC-2014BI011495 is duplicate of 
case CA-BIOGENIDEC-2014BI003176. The following information was previously reported in case CA-
BIOGENIDEC-2014BI011495:
[(On 29 Jan 2014) A 37 year old female patient on TYSABRI (300 mg, IV, QM) for Multiple Sclerosis from 21 Oct 
2009 to 08 Jan 2014 and enrolled in a Biogen Idec sponsored marketing program of Monitored Therapy reported 
being hospitalized from(b) (6)  to (b) (6)  for "feeling stupid" (onset 01 Jan 2014). The patient underwent
unspecified testing with unknown results. No treatment was reported. The outcome for the event "feeling stupid" is 
unknown.  Consumer causality was not assessed. TYSABRI therapy was permanently discontinued.
Update 25 Feb 2014: On written follow up the prescribing neurologist confirmed the event of ''feeling stupid'' and 
provided the diagnosis as PML (progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy) (onset Dec 2013 or(b) (6) ; date 
discrepant). The patient was hospitalized from an unknown date in (b) (6)  to (b) (6) . Treatment included 
plasmapheresis. The event is ongoing; the patient is slowly recovering and is followed on a regular basis for 
neurological assessment. Causality was assessed as related to TYSABRI treatment. TYSABRI was discontinued in

Aug 2013 (discrepant) due to high JCV index value at 3.20. Additional information was expected.
Update 05 Mar 2014: It was reported that a JCV test (presumed in CSF) performed on an unknown date was 
negative.]
Update 20 Aug 2014: Additional information was received from a neurologist via a MS Standardized PML Data 
Collection Tool. The patient is alive, residing at home, and is not currently on any MS therapy. On 20 Aug 2014, the 
neurologist assessed the patient s estimated Karnofsky and EDSS scores to be 50 to 60 (requires considerable 
assistance and frequent medical care - requires occasional assistance, but is able to care for most of her personal 
needs) and 3. A brain MRI was performed on 01 Jul 2014 (results not provided). The patient was diagnosed with 
IRIS, which was determined by MRI findings and clinical symptom of aphasia (cognitive/ behavioral; speech) with 
an onset date of Dec 2013. The patient received corticosteroids post-IRIS onset. Treatment with Maraviroc 150 mg 
PO daily and Remeron 30 mg PO daily was initiated on 01 Jan 2014 and is ongoing. The patient has not recovered 
from PML and has recovered from IRIS. Causality for the events to TYSABRI was not assessed.
Update 02 Feb 2015: Additional information was received from a neurologist via a MS Standardized PML Data 
Collection Tool. The patient is alive, residing at home, and is currently on Copaxone (glatiramer acetate; started 01 
Jan 2015) for MS therapy due to clinical relapse and radiological evidence of return of MS. The neurologist 
assessed the patient s estimated Karnofsky score on 02 Jan 2015 to be 50 (requires considerable assistance and 
frequent medical care). The patient's estimated EDSS score was 3.5 on 02 Feb 2015. A brain MRI was performed 
on 01 Dec 2014 with results reported as stable appearance in comparison to the previous study (11 Oct 2014) with 
no new or enhancing white matter lesions. A brain MRI was performed on 15 Jan 2015 (results not provided). As of 
20 Jan 2015, the patient has not recovered from PML and has recovered from IRIS. Causality for the events of 
PML and IRIS was assessed as related to TYSABRI.
Update 25 May 2015: A neurologist reported the patient had developed PML on TYSABRI. The patient had been 
admitted to the hospital in (b) (6)  and was treated with Remeron (mirtazapine), maraviroc and subsequently 
steroids for IRIS. She is still on maraviroc (150mg BID), prednisone (5mg daily) and Remeron (30mg daily).The 
patient continues to have residual aphasia and brain MRI shows encephalomalacia in the area of PML.
Update 05 Aug 2015: Follow-up information received from the neurologist indicating that the patient previously 
received teriflunomide (7mg, frequency unspecified) as part of a prior clinical trial.
Update 06 Aug 2015: Follow-up information received from a registered nurse at the physician's office reported that 
the last dose of study medication teriflunomide was administered on 18 May 2009. The patient was randomized to 7
mg on 23 Nov 2001 and terminated the study on 30 Jun 2009 with her last intake of study pill (7 mg) on 18 May

Update 17 Aug 2015: Additional information was received from the patient's physician via an MSL.  The patient is 
scheduled to undergo a lumbar puncture for CSF JCV DNA on 19 Aug 2015 to be tested at (b) (6)
Update 24 Aug 2015: Additional information received from the patient's physician via an MSL indicated the lumbar 
puncture was performed to see if there is any viral load in the patient's CSF to help decide what therapy to use 
post-PML. The results of the lumbar puncture are pending.
