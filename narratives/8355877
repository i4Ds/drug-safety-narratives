This din ical Idol case 
concerns a 65 
year old Caucasian Male patient. MedIcalhIsty Includediight pneumonectomy in 2010 with recurrent and 
metastatic disease to the pleura on a recent PET scan, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, ex-tobacco user, 
pneumonectorny, chemot , non-small cell lung cancer, cough, back pain, hypertension , Lyme disease , 
prawn  , Us, and osteonecrosis. Laboratory data demonstrated absolute neutrophil count 6.48. 
Concomitant medications included folic acid, cyanocobalamin, dexamethasone, fluticasone propionate, salmeterol 
te, salbutamol, atlopurind, ibuprofen, oxycodone hydrochloride, paracetamol, prochiorperazine edisylate, 
8 , 40 state, and magnesium chloride anhydrous. On 17May11, patient initially received pemetrexed (Alimta) 500 
mg/m2, in combination with carboplatin AUC=6 intravenously on day one of a three week cycle for the treatment of 
NSCLC. Prior to the event, patient last received carboplatin on 07Sep11 and pemetrexed on 10.1an12 as 
maintenance phase. Patient presented to the emergency room with excruciating cough which was present for 
approximately five to six days. Cough had become more severe and was unable to steep. Cough had been a 
chronic issue since pneumonectomy. Initially, he had a production of yellow phlegm. Later, the cough became non-
productive. He denied hemoptysis. Patient also had a fever with rigor and chills at home. Patient reported constant 
nasal dis   - with dear mucous. On 4111.11111111110months after last administration of carboplatin and 40days 
after pemetrexed patient was admitted into the hospital with pneumonia grade three and neutropenia with fever 
grade four. Patient had an excruciating cough upon admission. Laboratory data demonstrated white b co.  cell 
(WBC) count 1.7, platelet (PLT) count 84000. absolute neutrophil count (ANC).425, hemoglobin (HGB) 11.7, 
albumin 3.8. total protein 7.5. creatinine (Cr) 1.1, e o o  urea nitrogen (BUN) 7, chloride 98, and potassium 3.4. 
Chest x-ray was negative for pneumonia and no acute abnormality was demonstrated. Urinalysis was normal.

date. Due to the neutropenia, the patient would have needed another dose reduction. Per protocol, no more than 
two dose reductions during study. Therefore, study drugs were discontinued on 24Jan12. In the opinion of the 
investigator, the events were related to pemetrexed and unrelated to carboplatin. The events were considered to be 
unrelated to trial 0  0 0 0' 0 0  oures. It was further denoted the pneumonia was related to low white blood cell 
count (1.7), which may have caused infection (chemotherapy induced neutropenia). It was further explained that

Additional ation received on 25Jan12. Added multiple lab data, CT (chest, neck and paranasal sinuses) 
results, treatment medications, new event of pneumonia and hospitalization discharge date. Updated outcomes of 
events. Updated causality statement to include the excruciating cough was a symptom of pneumonia. Relevant 
fields and narrative updated accordingly. Update 08May12: Additional information received from the site on 
01May12. Removed excruciating cough as an event. Narrative updated.
