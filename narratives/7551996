This post-marketing study non-interventional (H3E-KL-B004, EudraCT number not reported) concerns a 56 year-
old Asian male patient The patient had no relevant medical history. No previous chemotherapy regimens were 
d. It was confirmed that the patient did not have any of the following risk factors which could have lead to 
cough: ng, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, prior episodes of severe bronchitis, pneumonia, 
re , 0  tract infection or other lung disorders, infection, environmental exposure or allergy which could 
have precipitated the episode of cough. Concomitant medications included tramadol hydrochloride for pain, 
obalamin/gastric mucosa extract as a digestant, amitriptyline as an antidepressant and chlorpheniramine 
maleateldih a ire bitartrate/Guaifenesin/dimethylephedrine for coughing. The patient> received folic acid, 
vitamin B12 and dexamethasone as per protocol. On 0'9-Sep-2008, the patient first received study drug 
pemetrexed (500mg/m2 intravenously, on day one every three weeks) as fourth line treatment for non-small cell 
lung cancer. He received his most recent dose of study drug prior to the event on 01-Oct-2008. On 08-Oct-2008, 
the patient experienced coughing, dyspnoea and febrile sense. On 08-Oct-2011, chest x-ray showed increased 
extent and density of patchy consolidation in the right upper lobe, aggravation of primary lung cancer. On-

411.11111days after the most recent dose of pemetrexed, the patient was hospitalised for pneumonia. Laboratory 
values on111111Mallablood gas analysis: oxygen at 71.3 mmHg (reference range 75 -100), pH: 7.451 (7.35 -
7.45), chest x-ray showed no significant interval change, (r/o pneumonia). Blood culture results from the same day; 
gram stain showed no growth for two days, no bacteria found, aerobic and anaerobic culture showed no growth for 
five days and urogenital culture results were less than 1000CFU/ml. On MEM complete blood count were

Corrective treatment included: unknown antibiotics, cough syrup and acetaminophen. The patient was reported to 
have improved on 28-Oct-2008 and the next dose of pemetrexed was administered. The patient recovered from the 
events onamowhen he was discharged. The patient was continued in the study. The investigator 
considered the event related to pemetrexed. No assessment provided for protocol p e;0ure. Edit 24-Aug-2010: 
Upon internal review of case, expectedness for US label has been added. Update 26-Aug-2010 Additional 
information provided on 18-Aug-2010 by investigator. Added corrective treatments. Amended date of onset for 
events and time to onset. Added hospitalisation dates. Added laboratory values. Corresponding field and narrative 
updated. Update 15-Nov-2010: Additional information received on the 08-Nov-2010 from the investigator: Added 
that the patient had no medical history. Added that the patient had no risk factors related to cough and the patient 
did not have infection, allergy or environmental exposure which could have precipitated the episode of cough. 
Updated narrative accordingly. Update 07-Jan-2011: Additional information received on the 04-Jan-2011 from the 
investigator, .0 a laboratory results. Narrative and relevant fields updated. Updated 13-Jan-2011: Edit to amend 
incorrect case type. Update 25-Jan-2011: Additional information received on 17-Jan-2011. Removed the earlier 
reported symptoms of cough, febrile sense and dyspnoea and replaced with the etiological diagnosis of pneumonia.
