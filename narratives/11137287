This medically confirmed report was received from a healthcare professional (HCP) via a company representative 
on 19FEB2015.  An 8-year-old child with a history of respiratory distress from fluid overload initiated subcutaneous  
H P Acthar (CORTICOTROPIN) Injection for nephrotic syndrome beginning in FEB2015. He was seen in his 
physician's office on 20FEB2015 with respiratory distress and fluid overload.  The HCP stated that fluid overload 
and swelling are parts of the patient's condition of nephrotic syndrome.  A chest X-ray was done (result not 
provided).  Per HCP, the events were considered related to the patient's nephrotic syndrome and not to Acthar.  
The patient was sent home with Lasix (furosemide) 20 mg, two times a day and was instructed to continue therapy 
with Acthar.  He was to return to his physician's office on 23FEB2015.  The outcome of the events was reported as 
ongoing.
Medical history included: Asthma.
