A report received from the Norweigan Medicines Authority (NO-NOMAADVRE-NOMAADVRE-M-64414) indicates 
that 47 year old female patient with Multiple Sclerosis since 1999 on TYSABRI (unspecified dosing) from Aug 2009 
to Jun 2013 developed progressive mental changes including dysathria after four years of therapy. The patient was 
diagnosed with progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (onset Oct 2013) three months after discontinuation of 
TYSABRI. Six months after TYSABRI discontinuation, there was no sign of improvement. Prior MS treatments 
included glatiramer acetate, mitoxantrone, and interferon beta-1a. The patient was anti-JCV antibody positive (date 
unknown) but was negative for JCV DNA via PCR. The outcome of the event was ongoing. Causality was assessed
to be likely. TYSABRI therapy was discontinued.
Update 17 Jun 2014: Upon internal review, this case is considered final call as a suspect PML case since  the 
treating physician is not known and therefore follow up cannot be performed.
