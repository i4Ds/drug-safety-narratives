MEDICALLY SIGNIFICANT
A study investigator reported via medical science liason that a  32 year old female patient on TYSABRI (300 mg, IV,
QM) for Multiple Sclerosis from 11 Aug 2011 to 16 Jan 2015 and enrolled in the (b) (6)
(b) (6)  (ID (b)(6) ) experienced suspicion of PML (onset 30 Jan 2015).  Medical history included multiple 
sclerosis diagnosed on an unknown date.  Prior to TYSABRI the patient had received Copaxone for MS.
The patient was anti-JCV antibody positive, in Dec 2014 the titer index was 3.51. In Mar 2015 the patient tested 
JCV DNA PCR in CSF negative.  During a routine brain MRI on 30 Jan 2015 the neurologist noticed suspect 
findings which were assessed as rather untypical [atypical] lesions for PML. The control brain MRI on 27 Feb 2015 
displayed suspicious findings and the patient was transferred to an external neuroradiologist for a second opinion 
who repeated the MRI in (b) (6)  The results were pending. The patient did not show any new clinical symptoms,
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analyzed in a local laboratory was negative for JCV.

FOIA Case Report Information
The outcome for the event suspicion of PML is unknown. The causality for the event of suspicion of PML is 
unknown.  TYSABRI therapy was discontinued.
Update 13 Apr 2015: The professor of neuroradiology from an university hospital to whom the patient had been 
transferred for second opinion reported that the second JCV DNA PCR in CSF test performed at the university lab 
one month after the first one returned positive and confirmed the diagnosis of PML. The first testing for JCV DNA 
by PCR returned negative from the local lab. MRI images (not further specified) showed rather subtle signs 
consistent with PML.
Update 16 Apr 2015: Follow-up information received from the study nurse of the neurological practice clarified the 
patient's initials, date of birth, and confirmed the patient was participating in the (b) (6)  study with study ID (b)(6)
Update 16 Apr 2015: Follow-up information received clarified the patient's study ID as (b) (6)
Update 13 Aug 2015: Follow-up information was received from the neurologist who reported the 32 year old female 
patient (note: patient age is 31 based on patient date of birth and event onset date) was treated with TYSABRI in 
the prescribed dosage and mode of application without interruption from 16 Jul 2011 (onset date discrepant from 
initial report) to 16 Jan 2015 for a total of 41 infusions. MS was diagnosed on 23 Oct 2001; MS symptoms included 
weakness of the left side of the face and tingling / paresthesia of the right leg. The patient was treated with 
Copaxone from 18 Dec 2001 to 21 Jun 2011. Stratify test was first positive on 11 Sep 2013, the last titer index in 
Dec 2014 was 3.51 as previously reported. The patient had neither relevant previous or concomitant diseases nor 
did she take concomitant medication. During a routine MRI on (b) (6) , lesions suspicious of PML were found; 
the patient had not developed any clinical symptoms. The last MRI examination prior to the MRI describing 
suspicious PML lesions was performed on 27 Feb 2015. The patient was hospitalized due to suspicion of PML from
(b) (6)  to (b) (6) . Lumbar puncture was performed on (b) (6) , CSF analysis was without 
pathological findings; CSF JCV PCR analyzed at the (b) (6)  resulted in 
0 copies. The patient was treated with 3 cycles of plasmapheresis, and with Keppra 500mg BID; treatment dates 
were not reported.
Update 18 Aug 2015: Follow-up information revealed that, upon translation of the hospital discharge letter, it was 
determined that the obtained information was not up to date. The hospital discharge letter referred to examination 
results from (b) (6)  when the MRI showed signs typical (or consistent) with PML, but the CSF JCV PCR was 
negative. Therefore the discharge letter indicated  strong suspicion of PML . The email received from the 
professor of neuroradiology on 13 Apr 2015 reported findings from approximately 1 month later;  the second lumbar
puncture was taken one month after the first lumbar puncture and CSF JCV PCR returned positive. According to 
the evaluation of the professor of neuroradiology (the same whose assessment was already reported in the

discharge letter) the MRI findings showed rather subtle signs consistent with PML. In summary, based on the 
information received to date, the discharge letter together with the 2nd CSF JCV PCR were positive for PML; but 
information on the patient s clinical symptoms were not available.
Update 18 Sep 2015: Follow-up information was received from the neurologist via a Biogen Medical Science 
Liaision who visited the treating neurologist. The treating neurologist reported that the control MRI will be performed
by a professor of neuroradiology. The neurologist also reported the patient feels good. No other information was 
provided.
Update 30 Sep 2015: Follow-up information was received from the investigator via the SAE form for the patient who
is enrolled in the (b) (6)  study. The patient was hospitalized on (b) (6)  with the diagnosis of PML 
which was considered life-threatening and assessed as severe in severity. The last dose of TYSABRI prior to the 
event onset was administered on 16 Jan 2015. Medical history, concomitant medications, testing details, treatment,
and event outcome were not reported. Causality for the event of PML was assessed as related. At the time of this 
report, the patient remained hospitalized. TYSABRI therapy was permanently discontinued (last dose: 16 Jan
