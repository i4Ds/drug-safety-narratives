A neurologist spontaneously reported via Biogen Employee (MSL, Medical Science Liaison) that a  female patient 
on TYSABRI (300 mg, IV, QM) for Multiple Sclerosis from unknown date to unknown date was hospitalized 
(hospitalization dates not provided) for suspect PML (onset unknown). The patient received 28 infusions of Tysabri, 
the last infusion at the end of February/begin of March and the first dose about 28 months before. She did not 
receive any immunosuppressant in the past. On an unknown date, the patient was tested positive for presence of 
JCV antibody, index value of 3.5. At the 28th administration of TYSABRI infusion, the patient showed cognitive 
impairment (onset Feb/Mar 2015) and an MRI was performed on (b) (6)  that was suggestive of PML. Thus, 
the patient was hospitalized so that plasmapheresis can be performed in case needed. A CSF sample was 
withdrawn on (b) (6)  and sent to a local lab. In case the sample will be tested negative, the neurologist would 
ship the sample to (b) (6)  The outcome for the event suspect PML is unknown. The causality for the event of 
suspect PML is unknown. TYSABRI therapy was discontinued.

Update 03 Apr 2015: Upon follow-up, the neurologist spontaneously reported via Biogen Employee (MSL, Medical 
Science Liaison) that the CSF sample was tested negative for the presence of JCV DNA at the local lab. A CSF 
sample would be shipped by the neurologist to (b) (6)  for analysis. 
Update 06 Apr 2015: The neurologist reported additional information via a Suspect PML Data Collection Form. 
Multiple Sclerosis was diagnosed on 15 Jul 2005. MS disease symptoms prior to suspected PML included 
cerebellar symptoms of tremor of head and upper extremities (onset 2005), sensory symptoms of decreased 
vibration sensitivity at lower limbs, and facial hemiparesis (onset 2005). The patient was on TYSABRI (300 mg/28 
days, IV) for Multiple Sclerosis from 01 Oct 2012 to 10 Mar 2015. The patient did not receive any prior 
immunosuppressant therapy and patient's prior immunomodulatory therapy for Relapsing-remitting Multiple 
Sclerosis included Rebif (interferon beta-1a; 44 UG, SC, TIW) from 23 Dec 2005 to 21 Oct 2012. The patient's 
clinical signs and symptoms that led to the evaluation of PML included cognitive deficits with poor concentration, 
difficulties in reading, and slowness of thoughts (onset Mar 2015), cerebellar symptoms of clumsiness in right hand 
and ataxia (onset Mar 2015). In Oct 2014, the patient was tested positive for anti-JCV antibody at (b) (6)  with 
index value of 3.5. MRI prior to suspect PML diagnosis was performed in Jan 2014 and MRI at the time of 
suspected PML diagnosis was performed on (b) (6)  A lumbar puncture was performed on (b) (6)  at 
Virology lab and CSF JCV DNA tested on (b) (6)  resulted negative. On(b) (6)  CSF analysis was 
performed that resulted normal. On 12 Sep 2012, laboratory testing included leukocyte count: 4500 (units not 
provided; reference range: 4.800-10800) and absolute lymphocyte count: 1100 (units not provided; reference 
range: 1000-4800). On 10 Mar 2015, laboratory testing prior to PML suspicion included leukocyte count: 9100/ml 
(reference range: 4.800-10800), lymphocyte count 28% (reference range: 20-45), absolute lymphocyte count: 
2560/ml (reference range: 1000-4800). On(b) (6) , laboratory testing at the time of PML suspicion included 
leukocyte count: 7750/ml (reference range: 4.800-10800), lymphocyte count 40% (reference range: 20-45), 
absolute lymphocyte count: 3120/ml (reference range: 1000-4800). The PML diagnosis was still under investigation.
Update 07 Apr 2015: Upon follow-up, the neurologist spontaneously reported that a CSF sample would be sent to 
(b) (6)  to test the presence of JCV DNA and a test to detect anti-natalizumab antibodies would also be required.
Update 13 Apr 2015: Upon follow-up, the neurologist spontaneously reported via Biogen Employee (MSL, Medical 
Science Liaison) that the CSF sample was sent to (b) (6)  on(b) (6)  results are pending. The CSF sample 
was also tested again locally for JCV DNA detection and 2 out of 4 tests performed resulted positive. All the CSF 
samples came from the CSF withdrawal performed on (b) (6) . A total of 6 CSF samples were tested locally, 2
samples examined with a sensitivity of 1000 copies resulted negative; 4 samples analyzed with a sensitivity of 300 
copies: 2 resulted positive and 2 resulted negative. The neurologist suspects a fluctuating PML identified in early 
phase, but they are waiting for the results of JCV DNA detection performed at (b) (6)  before making a diagnosis.

FOIA Case Report Information
At the time of this report, the patient was improving and she was still hospitalized. 
Update 20 Apr 2015: Upon follow-up, the neurologist spontaneously reported via Biogen Employee (MSL, Medical 
Science Liaison) that the CSF sample sent to (b) (6)  was tested positive for JCV DNA presence and the suspect 
PML was confirmed. At the time of this report, the patient's condition was improving from clinical and radiological 
point of view and the patient was at home. On 20 Apr 2015, the case was entered in the National 
Pharmacovigilance Network of Italy (ID: 303485) by the local PhV responsible person.
Update 21 Apr 2015: This follow-up, received from the National Pharmacovigilance Network of Italy (ID: 303485). 
The onset date for the event of suspect PML was 10 Mar 2015. On 10 Mar 2015, laboratory testing included an 
EEG and MRI (results not provided). The patient received first infusion of TYSABRI on 28 Nov 2012 (discrepant 
from previous information). Subsequent to the event of PML, TYSABRI therapy was discontinued and the patient 
recovered and maintained under EEG and MRI control.
Update 11 May 2015: Follow-up information received reported the number of JCV DNA copies in the CSF sample 
was 2322 (presume sample collected (b) (6)  tested at (b) (6) ).
Update 27 Jul 2015: The Pharmacovigilance Regional Centre of Campania, presume under ID 303485 previously 
reported by the National Pharmacovigilance Network of Italy assessed the case as probably related to TYSABRI, 
according to Naranjo algorithm.
Update 29 Aug 2015: Follow-up received via email from the neurologist.  After PML diagnosis, with the presence of 
only cognitive signs, the patient did not undergo PLEXI but she was kept under constant clinical and radiological 
monitoring.  Since June 2015, three months after the last infusion of Tysabri, an intense inflammatory reaction was 
detected by MRI, compatible with PML/IRIS with marked impairment of her clinical condition, with the occurence of 
right hemiplagia, cognitive worsening with psychotic features, alteration of her gaze with nystagmus and 
dysregulation of conjugate movement, and fluent aphasia.  The patient was treated with steroid therapy (NOS) 
(bolus of 1-2 g for three days every week and followed by tapering off by oral administration), and antipsychotic 
drugs to treat symptoms, with stabilisation of her clinical picture. She experienced myoclonus to the right hand 
[subsumed under suspicion of PML/IRIS] which was treated with Depakin (valproate sodium) and Keppra 
(levetiractem hcl) with discrete control.  The patient is still hospitalised in a neurological rehabilitation centre. IRIS 
was very reduced; her cognitive clinical picture is improved with partial recovery of her force to the right hemisoma. 
The patient is kept under clinical and radiological monitoring.
