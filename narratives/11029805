Medically Significantly
A neurologist spontaneously reported that a 45 year old female patient on TYSABRI (300 mg, IV, QM) for relapsing 
remitting Multiple Sclerosis from 18 Nov 2011 to 30 Mar 2015 was hospitalized from (b) (6)  to an unknown 
date for suspicion of PML (onset Mar 2015). On the date of scheduled TYSABRI infusion ((b) (6) ), the patient
was presented with disturbance of the visual field and right-sided hemi-ataxia persisting for 3 weeks. Tysabri 
infusion was not administered on (b) (6)  At the time of this report, the patient had received a total of 40 
doses of TYSABRI infusion. Concomitant medication included pregabalin for neuropathic pain. MRI (date unknown)
showed signs typical of PML in the left occipital region. The patient was tested positive on an unknown date for anti-
JCV-antibody. Lumbar puncture was performed on(b) (6)  and CSF was sent to a local laboratory for analysis
of the virus load. Treatment included plasmapheresis, mirtazapine and mefloquine for suspicion of PML. The event 
of suspicion of PML is ongoing. The causality for the event of suspicion of PML was assessed as related.

TYSABRI therapy was discontinued.
Update 08 Apr 2015: The neurologist provided follow-up information via a Standard PML Data Collection form. The 
patient experienced the clinical symptoms of right-sided hemiataxia and disturbance of the visual field 
approximately on 10 Mar 2015 which triggered the MRI examination on(b) (6)  (results see below). The last 
brain MRI had been performed 17 Oct 2014 and did not show any PML-specific findings. The patient was 
hospitalized on (b) (6)  for suspicion of PML and still remained hospitalized at the time of reporting. Liquor 
puncture was performed on (b) (6)  CSF analysis was normal. CSF sample was sent to the local laboratory 
for CSF-JCV-PCR testing with the result pending. Medical history included MS first diagnosed in 2003; the 
symptoms were paresis of the right leg. The patient did not receive immunosuppressive therapy. Prior to TYSABRI,
the patient had been treated with Copaxone (glatiramer acetate) starting in Feb 2009. Relevant concomitant 
diseases included recurrent depressive episodes. The anti-JCV antibody status had been determined by the 
STRATIFY test and was positive on 21 Oct 2013 with a titer index of 3.26. TYSABRI had been administered in the 
prescribed dosage regimen starting on 18 Nov 2011. The last TYSABRI infusion was administered on 02 Mar 2015.
The patient received 40 infusions of TYSABRI in total. TYSABRI therapy was once interrupted for approximately 2 
months (from (b) (6)  to (b) (6) ) due to psychiatric treatment in a hospital (the reason for psychiatric treatment 
was not reported). The patient was not participating in a TYSABRI study. Cranial and cervical spine MRI dated(b)(6)  
 was performed due to increasing gait disturbance for 3 weeks. Compared with the previous external MRI 
from Oct 2014, the current MRI showed newly occurred patchy signal enhancements in the left subcortical occipital 
region, with correlate in T2 and discrete patchy contrast medium enhancement in the GM only images. Known 
periventricular lesions of the white matter at both sides were seen with minimal progression in size of single lesions,
the largest lesion located in the left semioval center currently measured 12x5mm, previously 10x5mm. Signal 
enhancement in T2 and the GM only images, respectively; contrast medium enhancement could not be 
demarcated. No newly occurred lesions were displayed. MRI of the cervical spine homogenously displayed the 
cervical as well as the thoracic myelon as far as recorded without demarcated lesions or suspect contrast medium 
enhancement. No relevant spondylo-osteochondrotic changes were seen. Known small haemangiona of the dens 
was displayed. Evaluation: The image findings looked like PML left occipital. It seemed that in the course of the MS 
disease the known MS plaques in the periventricular white matter at both sides were minimally progressive in size 
however without evidence of floridity. No evidence of lesions of the cervical myelon. On 18 Nov 2011, small blood 
count and liver enzymes were within normal values. On 02 Mar 2015, prior to occurrence of the first PML 
symptoms, differential blood count showed relative neutrophil count of 41.0 percent (reference ranges 42-77), 
relative lymphocyte count of 48.1 percent (reference ranges 20-44), absolute neutrophil count of 3.28Gpt/l 
(reference ranges 1.5-7.7), and absolute lymphocyte count of 3.85Gpt/l (reference ranges 1.5-7.7). Leukocyte 
count was within the normal ranges with 8.0Gpt/l (reference ranges 3.9-10.2), the other values of the blood count 
and the liver enzymes were within normal ranges. On (b) (6)  the day of the first suspicion of PML, differential
blood count showed normal values for relative neutrophil count of 49.5 percent (reference ranges 42-77), relative

lymphocyte count of 39.7 percent (reference ranges 20-44), absolute neutrophil count of 3.91Gpt/l (reference 
ranges 1.5-7.7), and absolute lymphocyte count of 3.14Gpt/l (reference ranges 1.5-7.7). Leukocyte count was 
within the normal ranges with 7.9Gpt/l (reference ranges 3.9-10.2), as were the other values of the blood count, the 
coagulation values, electrolytes, CRP, liver enzymes, renal parameter and basal TSH. During the current hospital 
stay, the patient received 5 cycles of plasmapheresis performed on (b) (6) (b) (6) (b) (6)  (b) (6)  
(b) (6)  and (b) (6)  PML was treated with mirtazapine 15 mg QD and mefloquine 250 mg, both since(b) (6)  
(b) (6)  No further information was provided.
Update 09 Apr 2015: The neurologist reported the result of CSF JCV [DNA] PCR test via telephone. The CSF JCV 
DNA PCR analysis resulted in 80-100 copies/ml. The patient currently was clinically stable, except a discrete 
disturbance of the visual field she did not present other deficits.
Update 16 Apr 2015: Biogen considers this case confirmed for PML based on positive CSF, consistent MRI 
findings, and clinical symptoms.
Update 20 Oct 2015: The hospital neurologist provided follow-up information via a Standard PML Data Collection 
form completed during a phone call and medical records. The patient is alive, living at home and currently not on 
therapy for MS. The neurologist reported the patient was hospitalized until end of (b) (6)  was transferred to a 
rehabilitation facility, and back to the hospital in May 2015. After the discharge the patient was seen as outpatient 
on 10 Aug 2015 and 22 Sep 2015 and was clinically stable. The patient was feeling well and subjectively without 
deficits. Ophthalmologist examination found only mild scotoma. Mirtazapine and mefloquine were continued. A 
cerebral MRI was performed on 09 Apr 2015 with the following results: known PML left occipital, in the course 
slightly progressive in size. Otherwise MRI topographically shows no evidence of new lesions within the scope of 
the disseminated-inflammatory basic disease in comparison with the previous MRI from 30 Mar 2015. No evidence 
of floridity. The patient was diagnosed with IRIS at the end of Apr 2015 by MRI and clinical symptoms of headache, 
increased hemianopsia, blurred vision, and concentration disorder. The patient received no corticosteroids post-
IRIS onset. Treatment for IRIS included plasmapheresis from 19 May 2015 to 21 May 2015 and IV 
immunoglobulins 30 g (0.4 g / Kg body weight) per day X five days following plasmapheresis. A cerebral MRI was 
performed on 18 May 2015 with the following results: in comparison to the previous MRI dated 27 Apr 2015, distinct
progression in size of the known lesion left temporal and occipital as well as right frontobasal with inhomogeneous 
BBB disorder and left temporal juxtacortical within the scope of known PML. Additionally multiple, newly occurred 
lesions partly juxtacortical in both hemispheres more pronounced on the right side with proof of BBB disorder. 
Differential diagnosis was progression of pre-existing MS. A cerebral MRI was performed on 27 May 2015 with the 
following results: in comparison to the previous MRI dated 18 May 2015, the left occipital and right frontobasal 
lesions were constant in size with inhomogeneous BBB disorder within the scope of PML. The left temporal lesion 
showed a discrete regression in size in the course. Constant punctuate lesions in the right hemisphere and left

frontal with BBB disorder   PML with differential diagnosis MS lesions. A cerebral MRI was performed on 25 Aug 
2015 with the following results: in comparison to the previous MRI dated 27 May 2015, within the scope of known 
PML partial regression in size of the lesions occipital left, frontobasal right and temporal left with regressive BBB 
disorder. Minute contrast medium enhancing lesion found in the frontal white matter on the right side. The patient's 
Karnofsky and EDSS scores were assessed on 22 Sep 2015 to be 90 (able to carry on normal activity, minor signs 
or symptoms of disease) and 3.5. The outcome of the patient's PML (according to cerebral MRI and regression of 
findings) and IRIS were assessed on 22 Sep 2015 to be clinically recovered. The events of PML and IRIS were 
assessed to be related to suspect product.
Update 23 Nov 2015: The neurologist reported via MSL that the patient's general clinical condition was unchanged 
at her last visit. The patient had developed dyslexia and was now newly learning to read. The current MRI did not 
show changed findings neither concerning the PML nor concerning the MS.
