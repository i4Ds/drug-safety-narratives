A neurologist reported that a 26 year old male patient on TYSABRI (300 mg, IV, QM) for Multiple Sclerosis from 12 
Apr 2011 to 30 Oct 2014 was hospitalized from (b) (6)  to an unknown date for suspected PML (onset 03 Dec
2014).  At the time of this report, the TOUCH database indicated the patient received a total of 44 infusions of 
TYSABRI from 12 Apr 2011 to 30 Oct 2014. MS onset was in Feb 2007.  The patient is JCV antibody positive 
(index 1) with no prior immunosuppressant therapy.  Prior therapy included Copaxone (glatiramer acetate).  Repeat
JCV antibody testing showed index >2.  MRI performed on 03 Dec 2014 showed new non-enhancing left frontal 
lobe lesion and worrying parietal lobe lesion.  The patient was otherwise asymptomatic, baseline MS deficits of 
spastic paraperisis.  The patient was seen in the office on 04 Dec 2014 and admitted on (b) (6)  for three 
days of PLEX (plasma exchange), IV methylprednisolone, repeat brain MRI and lumbar puncture.  The outcome for
the event suspected PML is unknown. The causality for the event of suspected PML is unknown.  TYSABRI therapy
was stopped temporarily.

Update 09 Dec 2014: Follow-up information indicated the patient underwent spinal tap for CSF JCV DNA testing, 
no biopsy was performed.  The patient received three cycles of PLEX which completed on (b) (6)  and the 
patient was currently on Day 4 of 5 of SoluMedrol.  The patient had no signs or symptoms of IRIS.
Update 09 Dec 2014: Follow-up information received from the physician regarding a male patient in the age range 
of 20s was not displaying symptoms but MRI appeared to be conclusive.  The patient was in the hospital for three 
days last week for plasma exchange and spinal tap (results pending).  The patient was started on a "round of 
steroids."
Update 10 Dec 2014: Follow-up information received from the physician indicated that the patient had had high 
index values (JCV antibodies) and did not jump in levels as previously stated.  MRI images were also received.
Update 17 Dec 2014: The patient reported, via a Biogen Idec sponsored program of Monitored Therapy, that he 
experienced PML.  His physician said that based on the MRI he is positive for PML. He stated that his physician 
said he just was not symptomatic.
Update 14 Jan 2015: Follow-up information was received from the neurologist via a Suspect PML Data Collection 
Form.  MS was diagnosed in Sep 2007 (previously reported as Feb 2007) with motor focal symptoms including 
bilateral spastic paraparesis and abnormal gait (onset date 28 Feb 2011).  The suspect product was confirmed as 
TYSABRI (300 mg, IV, every 28 days) administered from 12 Apr 2011 to 04 Nov 2014 (discrepant end date, as 
according to TOUCH, last infusion on 30 Oct 2014).  The patient did not experience an interruption of the suspect 
product for greater than three months.  The patient had no prior immunosuppressant therapy.  Prior 
immunomodulatory therapy included Betaseron (interferon beta-1b) and Copaxone (glatiramer acetate).  MRI prior 
to suspected PML diagnosis was performed on 02 Jul 2013 (result not provided).  Serum anti-JCV antibodies 
tested positive on 07 Nov 2013 (index 2.69), 06 Feb 2014 (index 2.92) and 30 Oct 2014 (index 2.87).  MRI at the 
time of suspected PML diagnosis was performed on 04 Dec 2014 (presume previously reported 03 Dec 2014).  The
patient was evaluated for PML due to routine MRI which revealed suspicious findings.  The patient was 
asymptomatic.  Lumbar puncture was performed on (b) (6)   Local laboratory result was positive with the 
copy number not reported.  (b) (6)  laboratory result was positive at162 copies/ml.  CSF analysis showed myelin 
basic protein 14.36 (reference range 0-5.50), IgG synthesis rate 10.1, WBC 0, WBC 0, protein 38, glucose 54, and 
oligoclonal bands 17.  Brain biopsy has not been performed.  The patient received three PLEX sessions on (b) (6)  
(b) (6) , (b) (6)  and (b) (6)   PML treatment included mefloquine, mirazapine, Solumedrol 
(methylprednisolone), prednisone, and levetiracetam.
Update 15 Jan 2015: Biogen Idec considers this case confirmed for PML based on positive CSF and consistent 
radiologic evidence; despite the patient being asymptomatic.

FOIA Case Report Information
Update 17 Jan 2015: Follow-up information was received from the neurologist.  The patient was "doing fairly well, 
has had additional med problems yet seems asymptomatic from PML." On (b) (6)  the patient experienced a
seizure which required three days of hospitalization.  The patient recovered nicely and without injury.  Seizure 
recurred on the morning of (b) (6)  requiring hospitalization on (b) (6)  for which the patient is still 
admitted.  The physician speculated that the seizure could be due to PML or due to mefloquine or both.  This week,
the patient remained sleepy and mildly encephalopathic despite no further seizure.  Brain MRI showed no change in
PML lesion from (b) (6)  to (b) (6)  to (b) (6)  to (b) (6)   CSF sample was submitted on (b) (6)
to (b) (6)  to see if viral load has changed.  Anti-seizure medication, Keppra (levetiracetam), was altered 
in hopes of decreasing encephalopathy.  The physician debated high dose steroid speculating this encephalopathy 
may be IRIS.
Update 20 Feb 2015: Follow-up information received from the neurologist indicated that CSF was collected on 13 
Jan 2015 for retesting by (b) (6)  laboratory to see if viral load has changed.
Update 24 Jun 2015: The prescribing neurologist reported, via a TOUCH Prescribing Program Discontinuation 
Questionnaire, that the patient experienced PML. Since 14 Oct 2014 (specific date not provided) the patient tested 
positive for anti-JCV antibodies. No further information was provided.
Update 10 Jul 2015: A report received from Sanofi, Manufacturer's Report 1-739282102, indicates that a consumer,
the patient's mother, reported that her son who was on TYSABRI obtained PML, is now improved and stable, but 
has lived in a nursing home since 27 Jan 2015. He is not back to where he was before but he is walking and has 
cognitive issues with short term memory; the patient's long term memory was noted to be pretty good.
