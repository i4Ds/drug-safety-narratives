Medically Significant
A neurologist spontaneously reported that a 59 year old male patient on TYSABRI (300 mg, IV, QM) for Multiple 
Sclerosis from 2008 to Oct 2013 experienced PML suspicion characterized by memory disorders, dizziness, 
instability, and disorientation in space and time (onset unknown).  Concomitant medications included Effexor 
(venlafaxine) and Cymbalta (duloxetine).  Previous medications include Rebif (interferon beta-1a) from 2001 to 
2008.  Following TYSABRI discontinuation, the patient received two 5 day courses of Cortisone IV, 1000 mg per 
day, in Nov 2013 and Dec 2013.  Patient is JCV positive.  Testing included an MRI (date unknown) which showed 
cerebellar lesion that is compatible with PML.  No treatment reported and the outcome for the event is unknown.
Causality for the event was assessed by the neurologist as unknown.  TYSABRI therapy was discontinued.

FOIA Case Report Information
Update 20 Dec 2013:  Follow-up from the physician reported that the patient was tested for CSF JCV DNA on 20 
Dec 2013 and the results are positive (<50 copies).  This case has been upgraded to high suspect.  No further 
information provided.
Update 28 Jan 2014:  Follow-up information from the physician reported CSF JCV DNA (sample collected on 19 
Dec 2013) returned positive at 705 copies/mL from (b) (6)  No further information provided.
Update 17 Mar 2014: A physician (different from previous physician) spontaneously reported that the patient's 
health is deteriorating and is now experiencing walking difficulty, ataxia, instability, drowsiness, and conscious 
disorders (presumed symptoms of suspect PML).  A new CSF sample was collected (presumed Mar 2014) to 
perform a repeat JCV test.  The patient is currently receiving levetiracetam 2000mg (dates and indication 
unknown).  The physician stated the events the patient experienced have caused persistent/significant disability.
Causality was assessed by the physician as related to TYSABRI (discrepant information).  TYSABRI therapy was 
discontinued in Dec 2013 (discrepant information).
Update 24 Mar 2014:  Follow-up information was provided by the physician who reported that a CSF sample was 
collected on 17 Mar 2014 and a quantitative CSF JCV test was performed on 21 Mar 2014, and the result was 
positive with 70 copies.  No further information provided.
Update 27 Mar 2014:  Upon internal review, this case has been upgraded to a confirmed PML case.  No further 
information provided.
Update 28 Mar 2014:  Follow-up information was provided from the physician.  The physician spontaneously 
reported that the patient's last TYSABRI infusion was on 07 Nov 2013.  The JCV CSF test from 19 Dec 2013 had 
an index equal to 3.508.  The patient was then hospitalized on (b) (6)  due to deterioration of clinical status 
(presumed symptom of PML).  The patient's EDSS score pre-TYSABRI was 5, on TYSABRI was 3.5, and was at 
the time of this report was 8.  The patient underwent PLEX therapy on (b) (6) (b) (6)  and (b) (6)  
(b) (6)  and another three PLEX sessions were scheduled (unknown dates).  Additionally, while hospitalized, the 
patient experienced a pulmonary embolism (onset unknown).  Treatment included high dose cortisone, and the 
outcome is unknown.  Causality for the pulmonary embolism was not provided.   No further information provided.
Update 16 Apr 2014:  Follow-up information from the treating physician reported that a CSF JCV DNA test was 
performed on at a local lab on 11 Apr 2014, and results came back positive with 150 copies.  No further information
provided.
Update 24 Sep 2014: Follow-up information received from the treating physician reported that the patient is

FOIA Case Report Information
currently hospitalized for pathological issues, not associated with PML.  His EDSS is approximately 9 (noted to be 
"not due to his neurological condition).  MRI performed recently shows improvement (reports are pending).  The 
patient is currently receiving MS treatment with daily Copaxone (glatiramer acetate).
Update 26 Sep 2014: Follow-up information received included MRI reports.  On 13 Mar 2014, brain MRI showed 
aggravation of the image in the posterior fossa with features consistent with PML.  On 17 Apr 2014, brain MRI 
showed no substantial change with abnormal imagin in the posterior fossa structures with features of PML.  On 28 
May 2014, brain MRI showed confluent lesions in the stem, the middle cerebellar peduncles and the cerebral 
hemispheres probably in the context of PML which were somewhat reduced in size compared ot the previous 
examination.  No contrast enhancement or water diffusion restriction was noted.  Foci in the white matter in the 
context of the history of demyelinating disease.  A focus in the border of the anterior branch of the internal capsure 
with the left caudate nucleus, which was a new finding, showed no contast enchancment.
Update 20 Oct 2014: Information was received via a meeting abstract (M1708) from the 139th Annual Meeting of 
the American Neurological Association (ANA), Baltimore, MD. Karageorgiou CE, Giannouli E, Garifalia E, 
Athanasouli A, Kargadou A, and Tagaris G. Uncommon Infratentorial Localisation of PML in Natalizumab-Treated 
MS Patients. Annals of Neurology. 2014; 76 (S18): S109-S110.The authors reported 3 patients with an EDSS under
TYSABRI treatment of 2.5-5, TYSABRI treatment longer than 2 years, without prior immunosuppression, and only 
infratentorial localization of PML lesions. This case refers to a male patient with relapsing remitting Multiple 
Sclerosis initially treated with interferon (NOS) who received 67 infusions of TYSABRI. The patient's EDSS was 2.5 
(date unknown). The patient eventually presented with cerebellar symptoms after a period of extreme fatigue. MRI 
showed PML cerebellar lesions with quick spread in the brainstem. The patient received standard anti-PML 
treatment (NOS) with a final EDSS (date unknown) of 7-7.5. Conclusions: Rare infratentorial PML localization 
appeared after long-term TYSABRI treatment in patients without any prior immunosuppression. The disease was 
more severe and its course more indolent than other reported PML cases. Finally, the risk of PML still exists even 
three months after TYSABRI discontinuation.
Update 12 Feb 2015: Follow-up information received from the neurologist reported that the patient is currently at 
home; he was discharged from the hospital about a week ago and is currently treated with Copaxone (glatiramer 
acetate). PML is considered as resolved. His current EDSS score is 8 and his Karnofsky score is 50.
