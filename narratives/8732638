Initial. Mon for this Clinical Study case, AER number 1102547, was received on 08/Jun/2012 via Eli Lily & 
Company (Reference Number: JP201204007363) from a physician and concerns a Male patient of unknown age 
in Study SOLICITED BEVACIZUMAB Legacy Arts Study and received BEVACIZUMAB, PEMETREXED 
and CARBOPLATIN for lung adenocarcinoma 
No m history and concurrent illnesses were reported. No concomitant medications and past drugs were not 
On an unspe o  date, the patient started therapy with intravenous BEVACIZUMAB (Dose, form and frequency: 
not ), intravenous PEMETREXED =ODIUM 500 mg/m2 (form, and frequency: not reported) and 
intravenous CARBOPLATIN (Dose, form and frequency: not reported). On an unspecified date in Apr/2012, the 
patient dev 00- life-threatening event of HAEMOPTYSIS. It was reported that tumor cavitation was observed and 
It might cause the bleeding. On an unknown date, the BEVACIZUMAB, PEMETREXED DISODIUM and 
CARBOPLATIN were ued. On 20/Apr/2012, the HAEMOPTYSIS was not recovered. It was reported that 
afterwards, o  ca  led to the connection of lung and esophagus and the food that he had taken went into 
his lung. On an unspecified date in Apr/2012, the patient developed fetal PNEUMONIA ASPIRATION. On 
the patient died due to pneumonia aspiration. 
There was insufficient information about whether the autopsy was performed or not.

FOIA Case Report Information 
The investigator assessed causality for life-threatening HAEMOPTYSIS as related to BEVACIZUMAB, 
PEMETREXED =ODIUM and CARBOPLATIN. The investigator did not provide the causality for fetal 
PNEUMONIA ASPIRATION. 
No further information was provided. 
Additional information was received on 29/Aug/2012. 
The patients details were updated (Date of birth, age, and weight). 
history included obstructive arteriosclerosis of lower extremities, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, 
metastasis to pleura and glaucoma. He had a history of smoking (30 cigarettes per day for 45 years). On 26-Jan-
2012 he was diagnosed as lung adenocarcinoma stage IV with metastases to pleura and lymph nodes. 
Concomitant medications included DEXAMETHASONE, PALONOSETRON HYDROCHLORIDE, 
TRICHLORMETHIAZIDE, CILNIDIPINE, OLMESARTAN MEDOXOMIL, ASPIRIN, HYDROXOCOBALAMIN, 
VITAMIN A, CELECOXIB, folic acid and vitamin B12. 
On 29-Feb-2012, the patient received Bevacizumab 1080mg, pemetrexed 920mg, and carboplatin 740mg for the 
treatment of lung adenocarcinoma stage IV beginning . On the same day therapy with pemetrexed, carboplatin and 
bevacizum'ab was discontinued. On 08-Mar-2012, he vomitted one glass of blood. Gastroscopy revealed invasion 
of metastatic tumor of mediastinal lymph node in the middle of oesophagus and oozing from the part (Oesophageal 
haemorrhage) which lead to hospitalization but endoscopic procedure was not possible. On an unspecified date, he 
was treated with  0 0 and alginate sodium and Oesophageathaemorrhage was resolved. On 08-Mar-2012,

CT revealed extensive image of 0a 0 ,0 eumonia in the both lungs. Gastric fluid like vomit had been noted and it 
was cons as pneumonia aspiration of gastric fluid which was life threatning. Narcotic formulation for cancer 
pain was suspected as the cause of vomitting and opioid was changed to another formulation. He started to abstain 
from food and drink. Pneumonia aspiration was recovering about one week after treatment with meropenem, 
sivelestat sodium and prednisolone were administered. On Lab data showed pH 7.440, PCO2

The study investigator considered that pneumonia aspiration which developed on 18-Mar-2012 was related to 
pemetrexed, .0 , atin and bevacizumab. Relatedness for pneumonia aspiration which caused death was denied 
for the study drugs. The investigator did not provide causality for Sepsis, aggravated metastases tomediastinal
