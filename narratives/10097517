Medically Significant
On 09 Jan 2014
A neurologist reported that a  47 year old female patient on TYSABRI (300 mg, IV, QM) for Multiple Sclerosis from 
Jan 2010 to Sep 2013 was diagnosed with PML suspicion (onset only in Jan 2014).
The patient had a medical history of multiple sclerosis since 2008 and was tested positive for JCV antibodies since 
an unknown date. The patient did not take any previous immunosuppressive therapy. Concomitant medication at 
the time of the event was not provided.
In Sep 2013, a brain MRI showed a new small occipital lesion Gd-enhanced, discovered restrospectively. On 09 
Jan 2014, brain MRI showed a T1 hypointense lesion PML suggestive and a parieto-occipital lesion Gd-enhanced 
(extension of the lesion of Sep 2013). The patient underwent a lumbar puncture on 10 Jan 2014 and CSF samples

were sent to (b) (6)  lab for JCV PCR testing. The patient was asymptomatic.
TYSABRI therapy was discontinued for unknown reason.
No more information was reported.
French Imputability C2S1I1
On 22 Jan 2013
The neurologist reported that the patient was still asymptomatic. He also specified that following TYSABRI 
withdrawal the patient was switched to Gilenya (NOS).
The CSF was tested negative for JCV DNA in a local lab on an unknown date. JCV PCR results also returned 
negative from (b) (6)  Dx on 22 Jan 2014.
No further information was provided.
French Imputability: C2S1I1
Update 13 and 17 Mar 2014: Additional information received from the treating neurologist. The patient underwent 
lumbar puncture on 05 Mar 2014 for JCV PCR in (b) (6)  testing and the results returned negative. No further 
information was provided. French Imputability C2S1I1
Update 18 Mar 2014: Results for JCV testing in CSF came back negative from (b) (6)   The CSF was 
collected on 10 Jan 2014.  No further information was provided. French Imputability: C2S1I1
Update 10 Apr 2014: Additional follow-up was received from the neurologist. The patient experienced lateral 
homonymous hemianopsia and ataxia (symptoms of multiple sclerosis) since early Mar 2014.  The patient 
underwent a brain MRI on 03 Mar 2014, which showed left parieto-occipital Gd+ lesion, lesion extension observed 
as hypersignal in flair and hyposignal in T1.  A new MRI on 21 Mar 2014 showed same picture with suspicious 
features for PML.  The patient underwent lumbar puncture on 05 Mar 2014 (previously reported) and CSF JCV 
PCR testing is scheduled at (b) (6)  laboratories. The patient's clinical status was reported as stable since early Mar 
2014.  French Imputability C2S1I1
Update 16 Apr 2014: Additional follow-up was received from the neurologist. The patient received 44 infusions of 
TYSABRI from Jan 2010 to Sep 2013, followed by fingolimod from Sep 2013 to Nov 2013. Prior to TYSABRI 
administration, MS therapy included Copaxone (glatiramer) from Jun 2008 to Aug 2008 and Betaferon (interferon 
beta-1b) in 2009. The patient was diagnosed with RRMS [relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis] in 2008 and SPMS 
[secondary-progressive multiple sclerosis] in 2013. Clinical symptoms included right homonymous hemianopia, 
cerebellar ataxia, and memory loss.  Testing included a MRI on 09 Jan 2014 which showed new cortical punctiform 
lesion in left occipital lobe Gd enhanced, hypersignal in flair, including all cortical and subcortical area around; PML 
was suspected.  MRI on 03 Mar 2014 showed an extension of flair hypersignal to all occipital lobe; PML and IRIS

were suspected.  . Additional testing included a negative BK PCR in CSF (date unknown). The neurologist noted 
that the patient's blood pressure was always normal. LPs (lumbar punctures) were performed on 10 Jan 2014 and 
05 Mar 2014 with CSF samples sent to (b) (6)  for (JCV PCR) testing; results were not reported.  Treatment included 
high doses of methylprednisolone (dates not provided), but the MRI lesion was persistent and assessed by the 
HCP as atypical for IRIS [immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome / PML. The neurologist stated, "This 
diagnostic is possible (presumed IRIS/PML diagnosis) and before performing a brain biopsy to search a primary 
cerebral lymphoma, we would like to exclude this hypothesis with the highest sensibility test."  No further 
information was provided.  French Imputability C2S2I2
Update 18 Jul 2014: A different neurologist spontaneously reported via a Biogen Idec employee that all JCV PCR 
tests were negative.  PML has been completely ruled out. No further information was provided. French Imputability 
C2S1I1
Update 24 Jul 2014: Upon internal review, this case remains high suspect for PML pending final diagnosis, biopsy 
results (if performed), and results of any repeat MRI.
Update 23 Dec 2014: Follow-up information was received from the neurologist.  PML suspicion was based on 
atypical MRI lesions whereas the patient was asymptomatic. Three lumbar punctures were performed on 10 Jan 
2014, 5 Mar 2014 and 12 Mar 2014. JCV PCR testing performed at (b) (6)  returned negative. Corrective treatment 
included Solumedrol (methylprednisolone; 1gr QD on 5 days in Jan 2014). No plasma exchange performed. Since 
Sep 2014, the patient is under TECFIDERA. PML diagnosis was not confirmed (no alternative diagnosis was 
provided).  French Imputability: C1S1I1
