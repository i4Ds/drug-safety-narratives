AER 1610070 is an interventional clinical study case, received on 03/Sep/2014 from a hematologist and concerns a
78 year old female patient (patient number: (b) (6) ) who developed fatal progressive multifocal 
leukoencephalopathy whilst enrolled in study (b) (6)
Also reported as a spontaneous 
case, from an another health care professional via health authority italy Agenzia Italiana Del Farmaco (AIFA, Italy, 
reference number: 318328).
The patient had a history of herpes Zoster (Nov/2011), vitiligo, thoracic herpes zoster, pneumonia and recurrent 
pneumonia (complication of her disease). She had no history of chronic viral infections, HIV, bone marrow or solid 
bone transplant, herpes simplex, opportunistic infections, cytomegalovirus Pneumocystic Carini Pneumonia, CNS 
lupus or CNS lymphoma. Her concurrent conditions included right arm neuropathy, anemia, chronical renal failure, 
hypertension and chronic gastritis. Her concomitant medications included hydrochlorothiazide/valsartan 
(Combisartan), felodipine (Plendil), omeprazole (Losec), sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim (Cotrimoxazole and 
Bactrim), levofloxacin, itraconazole, allopurinol, valaciclovir hydrochloride (Zelitrex), methylprednisolone (Urbason), 
chlorpheniramine maleate (Trimeton), paracetamol, ranitidin (Zantac), lenograstim (Myelostim) and 5 G-CSF (5 
Granulocyte colony stimulating factor). Her past drugs included fludarabine and cyclophosphamide. The patient 
was a non-smoker. 
Findings from 2005 identified absolute lymphocytosis and axillary and laterocervical lymphoadenopathy (2006). She
was diagnosed with of chronic lymphocytic leukemia B CLL with trisomy 12 and del 17p (diagnosis reported as B 
CLL; CD38+, ZAP70+, IgVH non mutated del 13q14, RAI stage 1, Binet stage B) on 19/Apr/2010. In 2011, 
12000/mmc, Ly 43% and PD with doubling time <6month was reported. 
On 17/Dec/2012, the patient was screened for a NOXXON study (Study No. (b) (6) ) and the following was
identified: micro-adenopathies (cervical 1cm, supraclavicular left 1.5cm, axillary right 1In di 3cm, axillary left 2lymph
nodes di 3.5 cm), inguinal micro-adenopathy, no hypochondriac organomegaly. On 03/Jan/2013, she started study 
therapy with intravenous (IV) NOX-A 12, 300mg, IV rituximab (lot number: LO1XC02), 500mg/kg, and IV 
bendamustine, 70 mg/m2, once every 28 days for six cycles. On 21/May/2013, therapy with NOX-A 12 ended as 
per protocol. On 22/May/2013, therapy with rituximab and bendamustine ended as per protocol. 
In March/2014, the patient was enrolled in study (b) (6)  and was randomized to cohort receiving intravenous 
obinutuzumab alone, once every 28 days as per protocol. 
On 05/Mar/2014, she developed upper limb hyposthenia. On 27/Mar/2014, the patient started therapy with IV 
obinutuzumab (lot number: 1116234) 100mg, cycle1 day 1. On 28/Mar/2014, she received IV obinutuzumab 
900mg, cycle 1 day 2. On 04/Apr/2014, she received IV obinutuzumab 1000mg, cycle 1 day 8. On 11/Apr/2014, she
received IV obinutuzumab, cycle 1 day 15. On 30/Apr/2014, she received IV obinutuzumab 1000mg, cycle 2 day 1. 
On 28/May/2014, she received IV obinutuzumab 1000mg, cycle 3 day 1.

On 03/Jun/2014, she developed progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (initial intensity: grade 2). She 
received no treatment for the event. By June she had progressive loss of strength in all limbs. On 09/Jun/2014, 
neutrophil count was 1.4X10E9/L (normal range: 1.80-7.80). On the same day, she developed grade 2 neutropenia 
(non serious). She did not experience any other symptoms. On 14/Jun/2014, she received single dose of treatment 
with lenograstim (Myelostim) 1ml. On 16/Jun/2014, she received another single dose of lenograstim 1ml. On 
23/Jun/2014, neutrophil count was 2.9 X10E9/L. On 23/Jun/2014, the neutropenia resolved. On 25/Jun/2014, she 
received IV obinutuzumab 1000mg, cycle 4 day 1. On 23/Jul/2014, she received IV obinutuzumab 1000mg, cycle 5 
day 1. Her symptoms of hiposthenia worsened and the progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy became 
serious, leading to persistent or significant disability/incapacity. The patient could not hold a pen. On 01/Aug/2014, 
therapy with obinutuzumab was permanently discontinued On (b) (6)  she was hospitalized to investigate the 
causality of the event. During August steroid therapy was started and immediately discontinued due to worsening of
clinical condition. No other treatment was given for the event as it was considered too serious and the patient would
not benefit from treatment. On (b) (6)  and (b) (6)  encefalic NMR (nuclear magnetic resonance) were 
performed and showed ischaemic hypointesity in the rolandic area, with suspect for vascular lesions. Because of 
the onset of progressive expressive aphasia and the onset of worsening hemiplegia and hyposthenia, a lumbar 
puncture was performed on (b) (6)  and JCV (John Cunningham virus) DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) was 
detected with diagnosis of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML). A brain MRI was done at baseline 
and at the event onset for suspected vascular lesions. Brain biopsy was not done. Laboratory tests included: IgM 
(2.8g/L at baseline, 0.03g/L at event onset), IgG (6.69g/L at baseline, 3.15g/L at event onset), CD20 (159680/mmc 
at baseline, 100000/mmc at event onset), absolute neutrophil count (4260/mmc at baseline, 1553/mmc at event 
onset), white blood cell count (142500/mmc at baseline, 155300/mmc at event onset), but no CD8 or CD4 were 
done. On (b) (6)  the progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy became fatal (grade 5) and the patient 
died. No autopsy was performed. It was unknown if patient had stored serum sample available. It was confirmed 
that expressive aphasia and hyposthenia were symptoms of PML. 
The hematologist considered the fatal progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy to be an adverse event of 
special interest (AESI, serious infection).
The hematologist assessed the fatal progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy as unrelated to obinutuzumab, 
bendamustine and NOX-A 12, but related to previous therapy with rituximab. The hematologist confirmed that there
was no reasonable possibility of association between the study medication and the event. 
Upon review of available information in the case company causality assessed for event of fatal progressive 
multifocal leukoencephalopathy as not related to bendamustine. Based on this individual event / drug pair, there is 
not sufficient evidence to support a reasonable possibility that bendamustine caused the event of fatal progressive 
multifocal leukoencephalopathy.
