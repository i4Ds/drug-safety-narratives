Medically Significant
A registered nurse from a neurologist's office spontaneously reported via a Biogen Idec Medical Science Liaison 
(MSL) that a female patient on TYSABRI (300 mg, IV, QM) for Multiple Sclerosis from 11 Oct 2006 to 12 Feb 2010, 
from 06 Oct 2010 to 29 Dec 2010, and from 17 Sep 2011 to unknown date experienced suspicion of PML (onset 
unknown).  Additional information from internal databases included that the patient was diagnosed with Multiple 
Sclerosis in 2000. Previous MS therapies included Avonex (interferon beta 1a) and Copaxone (glatiramer acetate). 
The patient was enrolled in (b) (6)  however her current JCV antibody status was unknown. At 
the time of this report, the TOUCH database indicated that the patient had received a total of 72 infusions of 
TYSABRI from 11 Oct 2006 to 07 Jul 2014. The patient discontinued TYSABRI on 24 Nov 2012 due to pregnancy 
(MCN US-BIOGENIDEC-2013BI000965), and re-started therapy on 28 Sep 2013. The nurse reported that the 
patient had a new lesion as well as cognitive and motor impairment (presumed symptoms of suspicion of PML) and
a suspicion of PML. Testing includes a spinal tap scheduled for 05 Aug 2014. Treatment for the event was not 
provided. The outcome for the event suspicion of PML is unknown. Causality for the event of suspicion of PML is 
unknown.  It is unknown if TYSABRI treatment is ongoing.
Update 06 Aug 2014: Upon written follow-up from a Biogen Idec Representative, the following serum JCV antibody 
results were obtained from(b) (6)  study: 13 Sep 2010 - not detected (0.071); 11 Nov 2011 - not detected 
(0.088); 20 Sep 2012 - not detected (0.054). It was noted that the patient had not submitted any samples since 
2012. No further information was provided.
Update 08 Aug 2014: Upon telephone follow-up from the neurologist's office, an office representative noted that the
patient has had 3 MRIs this year and subsequently faxed copies of two MRI reports (17 Feb 2014 and 15 Jul 2014) 
and a 31 Jul 2014 office visit note. The brain MRI from 17 Feb 2014 indicated the following (compared to MRI 11 
Aug 2013): No acute intracranial hemorrhage, mass effect or midline shift, no evidence of abnormal enhancement. 
No interval change in the severe demyelination plaque burden of MS. The brain MRI on 15 Jul 2014 revealed the 
following (compared to prior study 02 Nov 2004): Findings consistent with patient?s known multiple sclerosis. A 
new lesion with restricted diffusion within the genu and posterior limb of the left internal capsule extending to the left
periventricular white matter most consistent with active demyelinating plaque. The office visit on 31 Jul 2014 noted 
that since the patient's last visit, she had experienced new onset of right-sided weakness, increased difficulty 
walking, as well as cognitive change and speech difficulty. Past medical history included depression, migraine 
headache, neurogenic bladder, sleep disorder, vertigo and left ankle fracture with plate placement in 2013. The 
patient is a smoker. Concomitant medications included Effexor XR (venlafaxine). Symptoms with cognitive change 
and motor change with MRI documented an enhancing lesion suggested either a breakthrough disease due to 
blocking antibody, MS variant or PML. Intravenous steroids, brain MRI to review changes to evaluate for cause, 
lumbar puncture to be arranged for possible PML identification (presumed reference to spinal tap scheduled for 05 
Aug 2014). If NMO positive but PML negative, then rituximab. If PML positive in spinal fluid then hospitalization for
