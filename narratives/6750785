This special su. rveillance (1i3E-JE-Ak01, PMS non-interventional) case, concerns a 66 year-old mate. The patient 
was 0  a as having malignant pleural mesotheliorna (stage IV, 0'0 ic.) with pleural effusion and metastases 
to.bpth regional and distant lymph nodes. The patient had histories of smoking 20 cigarettes per day for 25 years 
and asbestos e.,     The patient had no history of asbestosis, 7 0:0 herapy, surgery for primary disease, drug 
adverse reaction, allergy, interstitial diseases and pulmonary fibrosis. The patient concurrently suffered from 
 hypertension, diabetes mellitus, gastritis and prostatic hyperplasia. The patient received multiple concomitant 
medications including folic acid and vitamin 812. Thoracic cavity drainage and pleurodesis were performed from 
05 Feb-2 to 15,Feb-2008. On 20-Feb-2008, chest computerized tomography/high resolution computerized 
tomography (CT/HRCT).and chest X-ray showed consolidationin right lower lung fields. On 24-Feb-2006, there 
were no findings of interstitial diseases with no crackle and n  . n saturation (Sp02) 92%. On 25-Feb-2008, prior 
to the study  relevant lab data was as following: hem     0   (Nb) 11.1g/cIL, white blood cell count (WBC ) 
ifi30C;VcrwriA3, neutrophil count.(Neut)4410/mmA3, lymphocyte count (Lym) 1071/mmA3, blood lactate 
tlilidte. aleagenase (LDH) 166 IUIL, C-reactive protein (CRP) 16.17 mg/dL and performance status (PS) 1. The patient 
 secelited.the first dose of intravenous (iv).pemetrexed 940 me  in combination with cisptatin 136 mg for malignant

.olepta,tin..t*11.00.creased dose of 885 mg and 106 mg respectively, due to non-serious creatinine increased. On* 
linimpldays after the first dose and 10 days after the second dose, he developed WBC and.L decreased

starting the chemotherapy and Ways after the second dose, chest CT showed multiple scattered infiltration 
0  0 in right (Si, S4, S5) and left. lung (S1+2). He was diagnosed with pneumonia because bone marrow 
suppression as well as left shift of WBC was observed around the same time. Seriousness of the event was

900 INi v was started for the pneumonia until 11-Apr-2008. On 07-Apr-2008, Sp02 and CRP were 92% and 10.56 
mgridL. On 14-Apr-2008, pneumonia resolved. On 1S-Apr-2008, the patient received the third dose of pemetrexed 
combination with carboplatin (replaced from cisptatin) with 875 mg and 465 mg respectively, due to the 
pneumonia and general condition decreased. On 28-Apr-2008. 64 days after starting the chemotherapy and 11 
days after the last dose, chest X-ray and chest CT/HRCT showed enlargement of lung infiltration shadow in right 
lower lung lobe and .0 6  0  into middle lobe and peripheral. The reporter suspected bronchiolitis obtiterans 
Organizing pneurnonitis (BOOP). pneumonia or drug induced pneumonitis. On the same day, biapenem 900 mg iv 
was started until 13-May-2008. On 30-Apr-2008, Krebs von den kingen-6 (KL-6), pulmonary surfactant protein (SP- 
Sp02 and CRP were 648 U/mL, 32.4 ng/mL, 94% and 13.90 mg/dL, respectively. On 02-May-2008, Hb was 7.0

culture was negative. On 08-May-2008, chest CT/HRCT showed ground-glass opacity (GGO) and lung infiltration 
shadow in bilateral king fields. On 09-May-2008, bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL.) showed no bacterium and acid fast 
bacillus. Oral pr 30 mg was  . . On the same day, KL-6. SP-D, Sp02 and CRP were 757 U/mL, 53.0 
*int., 97% and 9.37 mg/dL, respectively. On 15-May-2008, chest CT/HRCT showed GGO and lung infiltration 
00 in bilateral king fields. On 19-May-2008, Sp02 and CRP were 96% and 1.90 mgelL. On 20-May-2008, the 
dosage of pr  e,   0 e- - was decreased to 25 mg. On 24-May-2008, pemetrexed and carboplatin were discontinued 
due to the king infiltration shadow and disease progression. On the same day, the lung infiltration shadow 
improved. The following examinations were not performed: pulmonary function test, cardiac ultrasonography, lung 
biopey, blood culture and drug lymphocyte stimulation test (DLST). On 29-May-2008, the anaemia improved with 
Hb 10.1 OIL. On 09-Jun-2008, KL-6 and SP-D were 1137 UirnL and 20.6 ng/mL. On 11-Jun-2008, WBC, Neut and 
Lyn were 107001rnmA3, 10058/mmA3 and 107/rrimA3, respectively. On the patient died of malignant 
neoplasm prOgression. It was unknown if the autopsy was performed. The ym decreased continued until the 
patient died. The investigator considered the Neut decreased, the WBC decreased and the Lym decreased as 
r. le cisplatin, and anaemia as related to cisptatin and carboplatin. The investigator considered that it was 
unknown:ills four events were related to pemetrexed. The investigator considered that it was unknown if 
pnetimoniesnd lung infiltration were related to the study drugs. The investigator also stated that the lung infiltration 
shadget could be caused by BOOP or pneumonia. No further information was expected. Case closed. Updated on 
07-Nov-2008: additional information received on 29-Oct-2008 from the investigator. Deleted event of second 
anaemia. Added new events of WBC and Lym decreased, relevant lab data, concurrent disease, treatment 
medications and indication of conc. med. Changed actual term from neutropenia to neutrophil count decreased, 
onset date of Neut decreased. Updated the narrative and relevant fields. Case closed. Updated on 16-Dec-2008: 
additional information received on 05-Dec-2008 from the investigator. Added relevant lab data including KL-6, SP-D 
and oxygen saturation. Updated the narrative and relevant fields. Case closed. Update 30-Nov-2009: Upon review, 
this case is being resubmitted due to a correction in the medical history E2B mapping.
