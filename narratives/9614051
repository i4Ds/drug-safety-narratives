The treating neurologist reported that TYSABRI was administered from 05 May 2010 to 26 Aug 2013 (39 infusions) 
without any interruption. MS onset date was not provided. The patient presented with motor multifocal symptoms 
(NOS) since 2002, sensory symptoms (date unknown), motor symptoms in the left leg since 2003 and a mild ataxia
since 2009. Previous MS medication included Betaferon from Jul 2002 to Jul 2006, Rebif from Sep 2006 to Mar 
2008 and Copaxone from May 2008 to Nov 2009. First clinical symptoms of PML were confusion, ataxia and right 
hemiparesis since 30 Aug 2013. Several brain MRIs were performed between Jul and Sep 2013. On 1 Jul 2013, it 
showed multiple punctate enhancement (at that time the patient was asymptomatic) without modification in T2 and 
DWI sequences. On 30 Jul 2013, the neurologist reported that punctate enhancement had disappeared and on 13 
Sep 2013, a frontal subcortical lesion compatible with PML diagnosis was observed. Regarding PML risk factors: 
TYSABRI treatment duration was more than 2 years, anti-JCV antibodies serology returned positive on 08 Nov 
2011 and no prior immunosppressive agnt use was reported. 3 PCR in CSF testings were performed on 30 Jul 
2013, 13 Sep 2013 and 07 Oct 2013, only the first one was negative. On (b) (6)  CSF analysis was positive, 
but laboratory name and number of viral copies were not provided. The neurologist considered the evant as 
confirmed PML related to TYSABRI. The event of PML was on going.  PML corrective treatment included 
Mefloquine (250 mg, QD) from (b) (6)  to (b) (6)  then 250 mg per week from (b) (6)  and still 
continued. 5 plasma exchanges were performed on (b) (b) (b)(6)  (6)  (6)  
(b)

Furthermore, the patient is currently experiencing an IRIS since (b) (6) . Appart from MRI features, observed 
on (b) (6)  the patient presented with tetraparesis, worsening of confusion and ataxia. Subsequent clinical 
worsening was noticed despites corticotherapy (1 gr IV per day from(b)  to(b) (6) ). On (b) (6)(6)  the 
patient was intubated due to respiratory distress related to aspiration pneumonia. At the time of reporting, the

patient stayed in an intensive care unit where she has been transfrered because of repiratory distress secondary to 
aspiration pneumonie and pulmonary atelectasis. Her clinical status was caracterized by tetraparesis, eyes 
deviation to the right and aphasia. EDSS was assessed at 9.5 on (b) (6)  whereas it was at 3.5 on 23 Sep 
2009 prior TYSABRI initiation, at 2.5 prior to PML on 31 Jul 2013and 4 on 30 Aug 2013 at PML diagnosis. 
Karnofsky score were also assessed : 90 on (b) (6)  (prior to TYSABRI initiation), 90 on 31 Jul 2013 prior to 
PML and 60 on 13 Sep 2013 at the time fo PML diagnosis.

On 16 and 19 Nov 2013
The neurologist reported that the patient suffered from RRMS since 1997 which was initially begnin  (no MS 
relapses during 5 years). She had neither surgery history nor prior history of allergy. In summer 2009, she 
presented with a MS relapse with Gd enhancement when she was treated with Copaxone. Under TYSABRI (date 
unknown), EDDS was 1.5, the patient hadn t  presented with MS relapse or new lesions.
Concomitant treatment included seroplex 20 mg per day and fampyra since 10 Sep 2013.
Monitoring MRI was performed on 01 Jul 2013 (see confirmatory tests). Standard blood tests were normal. 
Quantiferon was negative.  CSF analysis revealed no white cells, normal proteins concentration. JCV PCR testing 
in CSF was negative. New MRI was performed on 30 Jul 2013 (see confirmatory tests). CSF was normal and JCV 
PCR testing in CSF was negative (n=2). On 30 Jul 2013, 3 bolus of Solumedrol were administered without any 
clinical improvement. 
On (b) (6)  the patient experienced begnin  traumatic head injury and short loss of consciousness following a 
car accident (confusion and psychomotor slowing and right homolateral hemianopsia). Tomodensitometry 
performed in an emergency unit was normal. Since this car accident, the patient described an important increase in
walking ataxia, concentration disorder and diffuse paresthesia of the 4 limbs (quasi permanent).
On (b) (6)  brain MRI was performed. JCV PCR testing in CSF was positive  (on (b) (6)  according to 
previous report). TYSABRI was consequently withdrawn, plasma exchanges were performed and the patient was

given mefloquine and mirtazapine.
On (b) (6) , EDSS was 8.5. The patient presented with infectious complication (pulmonary disease) and was 
transferred to an intensive care unit. On (b) (6)  during hospitalization, MRI revealed IRIS treated with 
corticoids treatment  IV at 2.5 g per day during 5 days and decreased at 1g per day until (b) (6)  included.
At hospital admittance, the patient weighed 56 kg and was 165 cm tall. Blood pressure was 110-60 mmHg. Pulse 
was 80 per minute. Temperature was 37.4 degrees Celsius. Pulse oxygen saturation was 98 percents under 
oxygen mask. Glascow scale was 8. Hemoglobin was 10.2 g/dl. Glucosaemia was 1.24 g/L. Simplified severity 
index II was 35 (16.7 percents). APACHE II was 16 (23.5 percents). Cardio vascular examination showed regular 
heart sound, no heart mumur, no heart failure and no deep vein thrombosis. Pleuro-pulmonary examination
revealed bilateral crackling sounds predominant in the right hemifieldand bilateral ronchi. Breathing was 
spontaneous under high-concentration mask. Abdominal exmanination showed soft depressible and painless 
abdomen and presence of bowel sounds. Neurological exanimation revealed Glascow at 8, no signs of focalization,
midposition, reactive and symmetric pupils. The skin condition was good and there was no pressure sore.
On(b) (6)  when she was admitted in neurology unit, the patient presented with moderate psychomotor 
slowing, temporal disorientation, disturbed comprehension (complex orders), hemiataxia
with proprioceptive compound (arthrokinesia disorder and increase in eye closure), tetrapyramidal syndrome with 
right Babinski reflex, important praxia disorders, ataxic walking, positive Romberg symptom and support polygon 
extension.
There were neither cranial nerves anomalies nor cortical signs.
Since her hospitalization in neurology unit, the patient neurological state progressively  worsened until being bedfast
: tetraplegia (mobilized her left upper limb), ideomotor retardation, no axial tonus, major understanding disorder, 
tetraparesia and incontinence on (b) (6)
On (b) (6)  the patient experienced fever at 38 degrees Celsius (fever peak at 41 degrees Celsius) with no 
identified cause. Due to pulmonary worsening and negative infectious investigation, Tomodensitometry was 
performed and found Atelectasis of the right lower lobe.
As pulmonary state worsened despite aerosol and physiotherapy, Augmentin (3g per day) was prescribed on (b)(6)  
(b) (6)  Due to worsening, Augmentin was replaced by Vancomycine, Tazocilline and Amiklin during the night of 
(b) (6)  to (b) (6)
On(b) (6)  the patient was transferred to  intensive care unit as vigilance disorder increased and pulmonary 
state did not change.
On (b) (6)  EDSS was 9.5 and the patient underwent a tracheotomy to be intubated urgently. Bronchic 
fibroscopy found that the right main bronchis was obstructed by purulent and thick secretions. Several instillations 
were necessary to obtain an effective aspiration. The foci seemed to come from the right middle lobe. A Combicath 
was realized. Antibiotic treatment was replaced by Zyvoxid, Tazocilline and Amiklin. Sedation stop was quick  and 
awakening was not complicated. The patient experienced acute respiratory failure secondary to nosocomial 
infectious pulmonary disease after an IRIS treated by corticotherapy during 11 days.

Update 30 Apr 2014: A case report was received via the literature Castelnovo,G,Renard D, Thouvenot E, Taieb G, 
Caremeau C, Transient punctuate gadolinium-enhancing lesions preceding natalizumab-associated progressive 
multifocal leukoencephalopathy (Poster date and location unavailable). A 52-year-old woman with relapsing-
remitting MS (with stable clinical state since 3 years) underwent routine brain MRI at 41 months of natalizumab 
therapy (presumed to refer to 01 Jul 2013 MRI; previously reported) which showed frontal, parietal and thalamic 
punctuate gadolinium-enhancement in the absence of T2 hyperintensity suggestive of PML. The PCR for JCV in 
CSF was negative (presumed to refer to 30 Jul 2013 JCV PCR; previously reported) and anti-natalizumab 
antibodies were absent. A MRI performed 6 weeks later (presumed to refer to 30 Jul 2013 MRI; previously 
reported) showed disappearance of the gadolinium-enhancing lesions, and new puntuate T2 hyperintense lesions 
matching for most of them with the previously puntuate enhancing lesions. Her clinical state was unchanged. (b) (6)
weeks later, cognitive dysfunction and ataxia appeared progressively. This time, the MRI (presumed to refer to (b)(6)  
(b) (6)  MRI; previously reported) showed the presence of new T2 hyperintense lesions, still without gadolinium-
enhancement. The localization of some of these new T2 hyperintense lesions matched with the earlier seen 
punctuate gadolinium-enhancing lesions. PCR for JCV in the CSF, this time, was positive (presumed to refer to (b)(6)  
(b) (6)  JCV PCR; previously reported). Her neurological state worsened progressively, and two months after the 
appearance of the new PML-related T2 hyperintense lesions the patients deceased.  French Imputability: C2S2I2.
Update 01 Oct 2014: Follow-up information was received via the literature Taieb G, et al, Transient punctuate 
enhancing lesions preceding natalizumab-associated progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, J Neurol Sci 
(2014). The authors reported on the 52 year old female on TYSABRI described in this case.  Routine brain MRI 
performed at the 37th infusion displayed no new lesions.  EDSS was 4.0 when the patient presented with symptoms
of slurred speech and right-sided ataxia.  The second CSF analysis revealed 580 copies/ml of JCV DNA (previously
reported only as positive) and a diagnosis of PML was made.  Despite treatment with mirazepine (60 mg/day) and 
mefloquine (250 mg/day), the patient's neurological state worsened progressively and she became bedridden 
(EDSS 9.0).  MRI at month 44 showed progression of the lesions on FLAIR sequences, in the absence of oedema 
or mass effect, associated with frontal and parietal punctuates enhancing lesions.  Because of suspected 
progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy-immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (PML-IRIS), 
intravenous methylprednisolone (1 g/day for 5 days) was started. At month 45, MRI displayed diffuse extensive 
lesions on FLAIR sequences with disappearance of enhancing lesions seen previously. The patient deceased at 
month 46.  The authors concluded that their case illustrated that transient gadolinium-enhancing lesions can 
precede the emergence of PML-related T2 lesions, and suggests the potential importance of gadolinium T1-

weighted imaging to detect preclinical PML in MS patients under natalizumab; punctate enhancing lesions, even in 
the absence of FLAIR changes, might be the first manifestation of PML infection.
Update 10 Jul 2015: Additional information was received via Fampyra (fampridine) case 2015BI097175 as the 
patient was enrolled in protocol (b) (6)
subject ID # (b) (6)  while on TYSABRI. Per the Discharge Summary, the previously reported MRIs performed at 
months 44 and 45 were performed on(b) (6)  and (b) (6) . The (b) (6)  MRI showed widespread 
lesions supporting diagnosis of PML. The diagnosis was confirmed by other physicians. Based on the poor 
prognosis with severe and non-reversible neurological lesions, it was collectively decided by neurology and the 
critical care team that active life support and respiratory assistance should be discontinued. The decision was 
accepted by the family. Ventilation assistance was therefore stopped and the patient expired on (b) (6)
(b) (6)  No autopsy was performed for the subject.
Update 08 October 2015 and 09 October 2015: Additional information including medical records was received via 
Fampyra (fampridine) case 2015BI097175 (protocol 218-MS-401,(b) (6)
 An outpatient hospital note dated 05 May 2010 confirmed that the first dose of TYSABRI was 
administered on 05 May 2010. Medical history also included arthrosis. EDSS in Jun 2009 (prior to TYSABRI) was 
2.5. Per the SAE form for case 2015BI097175, the concomitant medication, Fampyra, was permanently 
discontinued (last dose administered on (b) (6) ).
