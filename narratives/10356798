This spontaneous report was received from a consumer or other non health professional via another company 
(UCB US Drug Safety Operations) and concerns a female patient of unspecified age from the United States; local 
case ID: 2014US001611.
The patient's height, weight and medical history were not reported. The patient was treated with infliximab, 
recombinant (lyophilized powder, intravenous, batch unknown) unspecified dose and frequency, initiated on an 
unspecified date for an unspecified indication. Non-company suspect drugs included adalimumab (unspecified, 
unknown) unspecified dose and frequency, initiated on an unspecified date for an unspecified indication, 
certolizumab pegol (unspecified, unknown) unspecified dose and frequency, initiated on an unspecified date for an 
unspecified indication, and natalizumab (unspecified, unknown) unspecified dose and frequency, initiated on an 
unspecified date for an unspecified indication. Concomitant medications were not reported. It was reported that the 
patient had used infliximab for 6 years and it worked great for probably the first 4 years. The patient then tried both 
Humira (adalimumab) and Cimzia (certolizumab pegol) with no help. The patient used Tysabri (natalizumab) and 
felt amazing but got the John Cunningham virus (JC virus infection) and so had to stop before she got Progressive 
multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML). The patient did some bridge therapies while waiting. At the time of this 
report, a new drug was approved in the United States and the patient was hoping to start within the next month. 
Treatment with natalizumab was withdrawn and action taken with infliximab, recombinant, adalimumab and 
certolizumab pegol was not reported. The outcome of JC virus infection was not reported.
This report was serious (medically significant).
