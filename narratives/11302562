Medically Significant
A medical doctor spontaneously reported that a  female patient on TYSABRI (unknown dose, IV, unknown 
frequency) for an unknown indication from unknown date to unknown date experienced suspected PML (onset 
unknown).  At the time of this report, the patient had received 78 doses of TYSBRI infusion with the last infusion 
given on 19 May 2015. The reporter stated that clinical presentation was dominated by a progressive clinical 
deterioration and MRI findings including new Gd positive lesions. The patient is JCV positive (presumed in 
reference to anti JCV antibody positive). The examination of JCV DNA linquor and sampling for antibodies against 
TYSABRI is planned in the following week. The outcome for the event suspected PML is unknown. The causality 
for the event of suspected PML is unknown.  It is unknown if TYSABRI treatment is ongoing.
Update 15 Jul 2015: The doctor spontaneously reported that CSF JCV DNA testing returned negative. Repeated 
MRI on an unknown date showed progression of PML. The patient was hospitalized and PLEX was initiated based 
on MRI findings. Repeat MRI and repeat CSF sampling are planned in the following week.

Update 20 Jul 2015: The doctor spontaneously reported that CSF was sent for examination (JCV PCR) on 10 Jul 
2015 returned negative. Samples sent on 13 Jul 2015 to test anti natalizumab antibodies returned negative. The 
patient's anti JCV antibody status has been positive since 2011, index of 3.879. MRI was performed on annual 
basis. Due to worsening of clinical status, three repeat MRI were performed (performed on 16 Jun 2015, 13 Jul 
2015, and 20 Jul 2015), all showing progressive findings suspect of PML. MRI images were provided. The patient 
was currently undergoing PLEX.  Repeat CSF JCV DNA testing is planned for this week. TYSABRI therapy was 
discontinued.
Update 22 Jul 2015: Additional information was provided by the doctor. The patient's clinical status has been 
worsening slightly. The second sample of CSF had been sent to (b) (6)  for testing JCV DNA. A new MRI is 
planned for next week depending on the CSF result.
Update 29 Jul 2015: The second sample of CSF returned negative for JCV DNA. A MRI will be repeated at the end 
of this week. At the time of this report, the patient was clinically better.
Update 04 Aug 2015: Follow-up information reported the patient's latest MRI showed progression of suspected 
PML. The treating physician decided to perform a third CSF examination with sample sent to (b) (6)  on 05 Aug 
2015 (CSF JCV DNA testing). The clinical status of the patent has not changed. Additional information received 
included MRI images for the following dates: 31 Jul 2015.
Update 11 Aug 2015:  Follow-up information received from the treating physician reported that the patient's clinical 
status is slightly worsened.  New MRI image received on 10 Aug 2015 showed increased Gd+ enhancement and 
oedema.  Results from third sample of CSF is expected in few days.  IV corticotherapy was started.
Update 14 Aug 2015: The third sample of CSF returned postitive at 11 copies/mL.
18 Aug 2015:  Upon follow-up received via a PML Data Collection Form, the neurologist reported that the patient on
TYSABRI (300 mg, IV, Q4week) from 27 Nov 2007 to 19 May 2015 is currently in the hospital.  The patient's MS 
symptoms prior to PML suspicion began in Mar 2004.  The patient did not receive any prior immunosuppressant 
therapy.  The patient's previous immunomodulatory therapy included Rebif (interferon beta 1a) from Oct 2004 to 
Nov 2007.  The patient was evaluated for suspicion of PML based clinical signs and symptoms involving motor and 
multifocal function since July 2015, which prompted an MRI with suspicious findings. The date of the MRI prior to 
PML diagnosis was 16 Jun 2015, and MRI at the time of suspected PML diagnosis was (b) (6)   Lumbar 
punctures performed on (b) (6)  and (b) (6)  were negative.  A lumbar puncture performed on (b) (6)  
(b) (6)  was positive. A brain biopsy and CSF analysis were not performed. On 27 Nov 2011, the leukocyte count was
7.78x10(9)/l (reference range 3.8 - 10) and absolute lymphocyte count was 1.8 10(9)/l (reference range 0.8 - 4). On

12 Jun 2015, the leukocyte count was 2.79x10(9)/l (reference range 4 - 10) and absolute lymphocyte count was 
2.79x10(9)/l (reference range 1.2 - 4.1).  On (b) (6)  the leukocyte count was 7.27x10(9)/l (reference range 3.8
- 10) and absolute lymphocyte count was 2.64 10(9)/l (reference range 0.8 - 4).  The patient received a total of 5 
PLEX treatments on (b) (6) (b) (6) (b) (6) (b) (6)  and (b) (6)  with a total volume of 
10,175.  Treatment for PML included mirtazapine, levetiracetam, and corticosteroid therapy.  The patient had not 
ever been enrolled in a Biogen or any other sponsored clinical trial. TYSABRI therapy was permanently 
discontinued.  The neurologist specified that the patient had not previously experienced interruption of TYSABRI for
greater than 3 months.
Update 20 Aug 2015: Biogen considers this case confirmed for PML based on positive CSF, consistent radiological 
findings, and clinical symptoms.
Update 17 Sep 2015:  Upon written follow-up, the neurologist reported that the patient is in clinically stable condition
and she began rehabiliation theray.  She is planned to be discharged from the hospital next week.  The patient's 
most recent MRI is without significant progression.  The signs of inflammatory activity correspond with IRIS.
