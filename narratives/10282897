Medically Significant
A neurologist spontaneously reported via a Biogen Idec Medical Science Liaison (MSL) that an adult patient on 
TYSABRI (unknown dosing regimen) for Multiple Sclerosis from unknown date to unknown date experienced 
suspect PML (onset Jun 2014). Testing and treatment for the event were not provided and the outcome is 
unknown. Causality for the event was unknown. It is unknown whether TYSABRI therapy is ongoing.
Update 24 Jun 2014: Upon written follow-up with the neurologist's office, a registered nurse in the office reported 
via a Biogen Idec MSL that a 57 year old female patient on TYSABRI (300 mg, IV, QM) for Multiple Sclerosis from 
22 Apr 2011 to 01 Apr 2013 and from 20 May 2013 to 19 May 2014 experienced suspect PML (onset Jun 2014).
Additional information received from internal databases indicated that the patient was enrolled in (b) (6)  JCV 
antibody positive (since at least Apr 2013), no prior immunosuppression, prior therapy with Avonex (interferon beta)
and MS onset 2010. Testing included the patient testing JCV positive (date unknown). Treatment was not reported. 
The outcome for the event suspect PML is unknown. At the time of this report, the TOUCH database indicated that 
the patient had received a total of 40 infusions of TYSABRI from 22 Apr 2011 to 19 May 2014. Causality for the 
event of suspect PML is unknown.  TYSABRI therapy was stopped temporarily.
Update 24 Jun 2014: Upon written follow-up with the neurologist's office, the neurologist noted that the patient has 
had adverse reactions to steroids. No further information was provided.
Update 25 Jun 2014: Additional information received via the (b) (6)  study. The patient, enrolled in (b) (6)  was 
tested for JCV antibodies on 06 May 2011; JCV antibodies were detected (0.99 nOD).
Update 25 Jun 2014: Upon written follow-up with the neurologist's office, a registered nurse in the office reported 
via a Biogen Idec MSL that the patient came in for a routine 3 month follow-up and biannual MRI. The neuro-
radiologist suspected PML. The neuro exam seemed normal, but the patient complained of increased clumsiness, 
visual and mood changes. The patient thought this was related to stress. The patient is part of the(b) (6)  study and
they don't have an index value on her. The patient is still in the hospital undergoing her 4th round of PLEX. The 
patient also had an adverse reaction to steroids so the neurologist is considering other options in case of IRIS.
Update 26 Jun 2014: Upon written follow-up with the neurologist, the neurologist reported that the suspicion of PML
was based on MRI findings. The neurologist also confirmed that the patient had not had any prior 
immunosuppression. No additional information provided.
Update 01 Jul 2014: Upon written follow-up with a registered nurse in the neurologist's office, the nurse reported 
that the patient has "confirmed PML." The nurse noted that the CSF confirmed it (presumed positive result). No 
additional information provided.

FOIA Case Report Information
Update 03 Jul 2014: A CD of MRI images was received from the neurologist's office.
Update 08 Jul 2014: A registered nurse at the neurologist's office provided a CSF report for the female patient, 
which showed that she was JCV PCR positive at 272 copies/ml via (b) (6)  (16 Jun 2014). A 
second test done via (b) (6)  (16 Jun 2014) for the Qualitative Assay returned "not detectable," with a lower level of 
detection of < 500 copies/ml.
Update 10 Jul 2014: Upon internal review, Biogen Idec considers this a confirmed case of PML based on the 
presence of radiologic evidence for PML as well as JCV positive CSF.
Update 08 Jul 2014: A healthcare professional from the patient's neurologist office reported the patient was 
diagnosed with PML during a routine [MRI] scan which showed new plaques and the patient was asymptomatic.
No additional details provided.
Update 08 Jul 2014: The prescribing neurologist reported via a TOUCH Prescribing Program form that the patient 
has been diaganosed with PML and TYSABRI has been discontinued. No further information was provided.
Update 18 Jun 2015: Additional information was received from a registered nurse from neurologist's office and a 
medical record via a Standardized MS PML Data Collection Tool. The patient is alive, residing at home, and is 
currently on Copaxone (glatiramer acetate) for clinical relapse (since Aug 2014). The patient's current estimated 
Karnofsky was assessed as 70 (cares for self; unable to carry on normal activity or to do active work). In Oct 2013 
the patient's EDSS score was assessed as 3.0. On 12 Mar 2015, a brain MRI was performed with following results: 
no evidence for interval white matter lesion burden progression. Abnormal enhancement has resolved. Cerebral 
swelling and edema on the right has resolved. Extensive white matter disease both above and below the tentorium 
again noted consistent with the given diagnosis of demyelinating disease. As of 12 Mar 2015, the patient has 
recovered from PML. As of 04 Aug 2014 the patient has recovered from IRIS. Causality for the events of PML and 
IRIS was assessed as related to TYSABRI.
Update 11 Sep 2015: A report received from Teva Pharmaceuticals, Manufacturer's Report 583879USA, indicates 
that a patient reported via a program of monitored therapy ((b) (6) ) that she experienced 
PML while on TYSABRI. The patient added that this had affected her peripheral vision and that her vision issues 
are getting worse with more blurriness and a decrease in depth perception. The patient reported that her MS is 
progressing and she does not think that there is anything that can be done. The patient's leg weakness has 
worsened and she has become clumsier. The patient noted that she has fallen but has not sustained any injuries. 
The report indicated the patient started therapy with Copaxone on 04 Sep 2014 (discrepant from previously 
received information which indicated Copaxone started Aug 2014).
