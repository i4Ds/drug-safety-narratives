A physician reported that a 62-year-old Caucasian male patient experienced JC [John Cunningham] virus 
encephalitis (viral encephalitis) leading to death, while under therapy with dasatinib for acute lymphocytic leukemia.
The patient had received the suspect drug dasatinib tablet orally at a dose of 140mg per day from 15-Dec-2014 
until 16-Mar-2015. The physician stated that the patient experienced JC virus encephalitis from 16-Mar-2015 until 
05-May-2015, while under therapy with dasatinib. Due to the event dasatinib therapy was discontinued. The 
patient s de-challenge was negative and re-challenge was not applicable. It was reported that the patient died on 
(b) (6)  due to the encephalitis. An autopsy was not performed.
The description of the event was provided as follows: At first the patient had experienced word finding problems,

and then he was not oriented anymore. Thereupon the patient was admitted to hospital. JC virus was detected via 
cerebrospinal puncture and the patient was treated with mirtazapine and donor lymphocytes. In spite of that, the 
patient s neurology, aphasia and motor restlessness worsened. 
As anamnestic characteristics and etiological factors the physician reported: state after allogeneic blood stem cell 
transplantation, polychemotherapy and radiotherapy.
According to the physician there were no changes of laboratory parameters due to the event. The physician 
considered the event possibly related to dasatinib therapy.
BMS Medical Evaluation Comment: This 62-year-old patient was diagnosed with JC virus encephalitis (JC virus 
was detected in cerebrospinal fluid), 3 months after initiation of therapy with dasatinib for acute lymphocytic 
leukemia.  Patient died subsequently. Immunocompromised state secondary to underlying leukemia (post 
transplant status), likely predisposed this patient to develop the reported fatal viral infection.
Supplemental information received on 01-Jul-2015 from the physician included the following:
The patient s laboratory data revealed JCV-DNA detected and suspicion of PML (Progressive multifocal 
leukoencephalopathy) which was considered additional medically significant event. 
The patient had allogenic stem cell transplantation on (b) (6)  Therapy with dasatinib had just been started on
15-Dec-2014 after the allogenic transplantation.
The patient s laboratory data included the following:
On 02-Mar-2015, C-reactive protein (CRP) was 2.0 mg/dl (normal range: <0.5), albumin was 3.4 g/dl (normal 
range: 3.4-4.8), leucocytes was 2.9 x 1000 microliter (4.0-11.0), erythrocytes was 2.52 units not specified and 
hematocrit was 24.0 % (normal range: 42.0-50.0).
On 31-Mar-2015, C-reactive protein (CRP) was 0.2 mg/dl, leucocyte at 5.3 x 1000 microliter, erythrocytes was 2.86 
Mio/microliter (4.30-5.60) and hematocrit was 28.4 %. 
On 07-Apr-2015, albumin was 3.1 g/dl and lymphocyte was at 41% (normal range: 25-40).
On 04-May-2015, CRP was 6.9 mg/dl, albumin was 3.3 g/dl, leucocytes was 13.1 x 1000 microliter, erythrocytes 
was 4.26 Mio/microliter, hematocrit was 38.8 %, lymphocytes was 31% and eosinophils was 1% (normal range: 2-

JC DNA in liquor: On 17-Mar-2015, at 295000 k/ml, suspicion of PML; on 01-Apr-2015, at 924000 k/ml, JC viral 
load increased in comparison to previous findings; on 09-Apr-2015, at 604000 k/ml JCV-DNA still positively 
detected in liquor; on 28-Apr-2015, at 1370000 k/ml, JC viral load in liquor had increased in comparison to previous

Bms Medical Evaluation Comment;
This 62-year-old patient was diagnosed with JC virus encephalitis (JC virus was detected in cerebrospinal fluid), 3 
months after initiation of therapy with dasatinib for acute lymphocytic leukemia.  Patient died subsequently. 
Immunocompromised state secondary to underlying leukemia (post transplant status), likely predisposed this 
patient to develop the reported fatal viral infection possibly leading to progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy. 
Hence, the reported events were considered unrelated to suspect therapy.
