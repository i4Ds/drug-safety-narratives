Medically Significant
An adult male patient on TYSABRI (300 mg, IV, QM) for relapsing remitting Multiple Sclerosis from an unknown 
date to an unknown date and enrolled in a Biogen Idec sponsored marketing program of Monitored Therapy 
reported difficulty in balance (onset unknown).  Treatment was not reported and the outcome is unknown.
Causality was not assessed and it is unknown if TYSABRI treatment is ongoing.
Update 29 Apr 2014: A neurologist reported via a program of Monitored Therapy that the male patient was 
hospitalized from an unknown date to an unknown date for PML suspicion with the first sign of having difficulty in 
balance. The treatment and lab testing for the event were not reported. The event is ongoing and the causality was 
assessed as related. TYSABRI therapy was discontinued.
Update 04 Jun 2014: Additional information was received. The result of the patient's CSF JCV [DNA] PCR 
(unknown date) was 48119 copies/ml.
Update 17 Jun 2014: Additional information was received. The 51 year old male was on TYSABRI from Mar 2012 to
Apr 2014 with no therapy interruption. MS was diagnosed on 02 Mar 1999. The patient had no prior history of IS 
use. Previous MS therapies included Rebif (interferon beta-1a) 44mg SC 3 times weekly from 2011 to 2012 and 
Copaxone (glatiramer acetate) from 2004 to 2011.  The patient is anti-JCV antibody positive on 27 Nov 2013 and 
on 17 Apr 2014 (tested by (b) (6) ).
The patient presented with multifocal motor (paraparesia) and cerebellar symptoms (ataxia) on 08 Apr 2014 
(previously reported as difficulty in balance). MRI at the time of PML diagnosis was performed on 11 Apr 2014; MRI
report was not provided but MRI images on CD was provided. The patient had a LP on 11 Apr 2014 but 
unfortunately the CSF vial was broke in transport and CSF JCV testing was not performed. Brain biopsy had not 
been done. CSF analysis from 11 Apr 2014 was normal. CD4 count was tested on 10 Oct 2013; results not 
provided. The patient underwent 5 cycles of PLEX and was treated with Methylprednisolone 1000mg daily from (b)(6)  
(b) (6)  to (b) (6)  The patient is currently hospitalized. Causality was assessed as related to TYSABRI. 
PML was still under investigation.
Update 17 Jun 2014: Additional information was provided via a Standard PML Data Collection form. The patient's 
CSF collected on 11 Apr 2014 returned positive from (b) (6)  at 48,119 copies/mL; the CSF sample was tested on 
25 May 2014 after another aliquot of the CSF was sent. The patient is HIV negative. The patient had a repeat MRI 
on 04 Jun 2014; MRI report was not provided. Estimated Karnofsky and EDSS scores were the following: 05 May 
2012 (pre-TYSABRI) - Karnofsky = 80 and EDSS = 4.0; 05 Mar 2014 (on TYSABRI) - Karnofsky = 70 and EDSS = 
5.0; 04 Jun 2014 (at time of PML diagnosis) - Karnofsky = 20 and EDSS = 6.0. Outcome of PML was unknown.

Causality was related. 
Update 17 Jul 2014: Upon internal review, this case is considered to be confirmed for PML based on positive CSF 
and MRI and clinical symptoms.
Update 08 Oct 2014: Additional information was received from the neurologist via a MS Standardized PML Data 
Collection Tool. The patient is alive and is residing in a nursing home. The patient was diagnosed with IRIS, 
determined by clinical symptoms and MRI findings. The onset date of the clinical symptoms was 17 Jun 2014 and 
included seizure, speech, and cognitive/ behavioral symptoms. Estimated Karnofsky and EDSS scores were the 
following: 05 Mar 2012 (pre-TYSABRI) - Karnofsky = 80 and EDSS = 4.0; 05 Mar 2014 (on TYSABRI) - Karnofsky =
70 and EDSS = 5.0; 04 Jun 2014 (at time of PML diagnosis) - Karnofsky = 20 and EDSS = 6.0. The patient was 
tested positive for serum anti JCV antibodies on 27 Nov 2013 and 17 Apr 2014 from (b) (6)  The patient received 
corticosteroids prior to the onset of IRIS. Treatment for IRIS included intravenous methylprednisolone 1000 mg 
daily for seven days. The patient has recovered from PML. As of 22 Jul 2014, the patient has recovered from IRIS. 
Causality for the events was assessed as related to TYSABRI.
Update 04 Dec 2014: Additional information was received from the neurologist via a MS Standardized PML Data 
Collection Tool. The patient is alive, residing in a nursing home, and is not currently on any MS therapy. The 
neurologist assessed the patient's estimated Karnofsky and EDSS scores on 02 Dec 2014 to be 40 (disabled; 
requires special care and assistance) and 9.0. The following lab values from 01 Dec 2014 were reported: leukocyte 
count 13.7 (normal range 4.0 - 10 x10(3)/mcL); lymphocyte count 0.62 (normal range 1 - 3 x10(3)/mcL); and 
absolute lymphocyte count 4.54 (normal range 20-40%). A brain MRI was performed on 30 Nov 2014 (awaiting 
results). As of 04 Jun 2014, the patient has recovered from PML. As of 22 Jul 2014, the patient has recovered from 
IRIS. Causality for the events was assessed as related to TYSABRI.
Update 12 Mar 2015: Follow-up information received indicated that the patient died on (b) (6) . No further 
information was provided.
Update 13 Mar 2015: Follow-up information provided the cause of death as cardiopulmonary arrest secondary to 
aspiration pneumonia (onset (b) (6) ) and sepsis (onset(b) (6) ). Relevant laboratory findings included 
the following: (b) (6)  - CRP 33.4, (b) (6)  - WBC 8780, (b) (6)  - CRP 4.4, (b) (6)  - CRP 
14.8, (b) (6)  - WBC 32900 (reference ranges and units not provided).
Update 24 Apr 2015: Additional information was received from the neurologist via a Standardized MS PML Data 
Collection Tool. The neurologist reported that the patient died on (b) (6)  and the reported cause of death was
