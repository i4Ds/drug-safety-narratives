Sender's Comments: Additional information (03Feb2016) does not change the assessment of the case; it remains 
serious and unlikely related.
08Feb2016
This case is serious; and based on the details currently available there is no reasonable evidence in favor of a 
causal association of Unresponsive to stimuli and Gammagard Liquid; therefore assessed as unlikely related. 
Furthermore, the adverse event was reported to occur prior to receiving infusion.
