Autonomous Community: Galicia
A neurologist spontaneously reported that a 38 year old male patient on TYSABRI (300 mg, IV, QM) for Multiple 
Sclerosis for five years was hospitalized from an unknown date to an unknown date for suspicion of progressive 
multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) (onset unknown).  The patient had referred right hemiparesis 2 to 3 months 
ago and the rest of the neurological exam was normal.  The patient presented with "slight worsening".  An MRI 
performed on 09 Dec 2014 showed cerebellar and cerebellar peduncle involvement suggestive of PML.  An MRI 
from 28 May 2014 was normal.  Prior MS therapy included Betaferon (interferon beta-1b).  The patient is anti-JCV 
antibody positive, with an index value "around 3".  No treatment was reported.  The event of suspected PML is 
ongoing and the outcome for the event of referred right hemiparesis is unknown.  The neurologist assessed 
causality as related for the event of suspected PML and did not provide a causality assessment for the event of 
referred right hemiparesis.  TYSABRl therapy was discontinued.
Update 15 Dec 2014:  The neurologist provided the following additional information.  The patient's past medical 
history included depression (currently stable).  Treatment for the event of suspected PML included mirtazapine, 
mefloquine, and plasma exchange (PLEX); the patient's third session of PLEX was on 15 Dec 2014.  A lumbar 
puncture (LP) from 10 Dec 2014 showed the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was positive for JCV DNA at 1,267 copies/ 
mL (lower limit of detection unknown).
Update 09 Jan 2015:  New information provided by the neurologist. The patient has not progressed. The 
neurologist thinks the patient is a little better.
Update 19 Jan 2015: The neurologist provided additional follow-up information, which indicated that the neurologist 
plans to perform a lumbar puncture on the patient (date unknown) and that the neurologist is considering treating 
the patient with fingolimod. 
Update 22 Jan 2015: Additional information was provided by the neurologist. The patient received 5 sessions of 
plasmapheresis as a treatment for PML. The patient was also treated with mefloquine and mirtazapine. At the time 
of this report, the patient was neurologically stable although he presented with a respiratory infection caused by 
pseudomonas (onset unknown) that made the patient worsen in a respiratory way. The last MR (presume MRI) 
performed 5 days ago (presume 17 Jan 2015) did not show differences compared to the previous ones (dates & 
results not specified). The neurologist indicated that the lumbar puncture was postponed until the patient recovered 
from the respiratory infection. Testing and treatment for the event of respiratory infection caused by pseudomonas 
was not provided, and the outcome is unknown. Causality for the event was not assessed by the neurologist.

FOIA Case Report Information
Update 04 Feb 2015: The neurologist spontaneously reported via a Biogen Idec Area Business Manager (ABM) 
that the patient was hospitalized (dates of hospitalization not provided) for pseudomonas aeruginosa infection 
(onset unknown; previously reported as respiratory infection caused by pseudomonas). During the admission, the 
patient had a bronchoaspiration (onset unknown). Testing and treatment for the events was not provided. The 
event of respiratory infection caused by pseudomonas is ongoing. The outcome of the event bronchoaspiration is 
unknown. Causality for the events was not assessed by the neurologist. 
Update 10 Feb 2015: The neurologist spontaneously reported that the patient had not recovered from the 
respiratory infection caused by pseudomonas. The neurologist also indicated that the neurological situation of the 
patient had deteriorated, although the last MRI performed (date unknown; presume reference to the MRI performed
17 Jan 2015) did not show differences compared to the previous ones.
Update 11 Feb 2015: The neurologist spontaneously reported that the patient passed away on (b) (6)  The 
cause of death was not provided. Testing and treatment were not provided. It is unknown if an autopsy was 
performed. Causality for the event of death was not assessed by the neurologist.
Update 12 Feb 2015: The neurologist spontaneously reported that he thinks the patient died due to the PML and 
the pseudomonas infection. No autopsy will be performed.
Update 23 Feb 2015: The neurologist provided MRI images from the following dates: 26 May 2014 (presume 
reference to previously reported 28 May 2014 MRI), 09 Dec 2014, 11 Dec 2014, 02 Jan 2015, and 19 Jan 2015 
(presume reference to previously reported 17 Jan 2015 MRI). No corresponding results were provided.
Update 03 Mar 2015: On 03 Mar 2015, Biogen Idec considers this case confirmed for PML based on positive CSF, 
consistent radiological evidence, and clinical symptoms.
