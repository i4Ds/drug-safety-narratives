Medically Significant 
A neurologist spontaneously reported via a Biogen employee (Medical Science Liaison, MSL) that a 32 year old 
female patient on TYSABRI (300 mg, IV, QM) for Multiple Sclerosis from 01 Sep 2007 to 01 Feb 2015 was 
hospitalized from (b) (6)  to an unknown date for suspicion of PML (onset Feb 2015).  The patient had 
received a total of 75 TYSABRI infusions.  The patient was diagnosed with MS in 2000.  The patient's MS 
symptoms included in particular fatigue and slight neurological symptoms; during the last years, she had not 
experienced any MS relapse.  Previous MS therapy included Copaxone (glatiramer) from 2004 to 2005 which was 
discontinued due to allergic intolerance.  The patient had never been treated with any immunosuppressive 
medication. Medical history included chronic migraine, recurrent depressive disorder, and thalassemia (NOS). 
Concomitant medications included fluoxetine, Dominal (prothipendyl) and alprazolam.  The patient had experienced
clinical symptoms described as petulance and chronic headache of varying localization, concentration, and mnestic 
disturbance, and increased exhaustibility beginning 1 to 1.5 months after discontinuation of TYSABRI leading to 
suspicion of organic brain syndrome in Feb 2015.  A cerebral MRI at that time (presume Feb 2015) showed 
pathological findings (NOS).  The suspicion of PML could not be confirmed, however the patient tested positive for 
anti JCV antibody in serum since 2011 (exact date not provided).  Neurological examination (date unknown) 
showed discrete pyramidal signs of the right leg.  The first MRI describing PML specific changes had been 
performed in Apr 2015 (results not provided).  According to the neurologist, white blood count had always been 
within normal ranges. The patient had been transferred to a university hospital for further diagnostics (e.g. lumbar 
puncture, and treatment, NOS).  The event of suspicion of PML is ongoing. The causality for the event of suspicion 
of PML is unknown.  TYSABRI therapy was discontinued (reason unknown).  Since Mar 2015, the patient was 
enrolled in a Gilenya (fingolimod) study and was treated with fingolimod. 
Update 29 May 2015:  Additional information was provided by the neurologist via a current MRI report.  A cerebral 
MRI performed on 27 May 2015 compared with previous MRI from 06 Mar 2015 unfortunately showed distinct 
deterioration of findings with significant increase of the previously described ribbon-like patchy signal 
enhancements temporally right which currently were displayed as expanded extensive confluent gliosis area in 
large parts of the right temporal lobe ending finger-shaped towards the subcortical region. The dimensions were 
transversally 7.1 times 2.5cm, with newly occurred contrast enhancement more pronounced at the edges.  Multiple 
additional newly occurred T2 FLAIR signal enhancements at the subcortical region in particular at the left frontal 
region were noted, but also at the left fronto-parietal and flatly also at the left temporal, as well as the occipital 
regions of both sides and the right frontal region with each barrier disturbance partly at the edge and partly striped. 
On the other hand the previously described periventricular lesions were displayed mostly unchanged. At the 
infratentorial region, a small punctuate lesion newly had occurred paramedian in the left pons with barrier 
disturbance, too.  Normally symmetrical width of the cerebrospinal ventricles was displayed. There was no atrophy 
and no evidence of circulation disturbance of the cerebrospinal fluid.  The following was concluded: significant

deterioration of findings with presently expanded extensive gliosis nearly in the entire right temporal lobe and BBB 
disturbance more pronounced at the edge. Additionally multiple further newly occurred subcortical lesions with BBB 
disturbance also in the remaining parenchyma. The subcortical partly ribbon-like lesions and particularly the 
findings situated right temporally were not typical for a manifestation within the scope of MS when considering their 
aspect, but unfortunately urgently suspicious of PML.
Update 08 Jun 2015: Additional information was provided by a hospital neurologist via a Biogen employee.  The 
patient's initials provided were discrepant from initial report.  The patient received TYSABRI from Nov 2007 (date 
discrepant) to Feb 2015.  RRMS was diagnosed in May 2000. Previous MS therapy included Copaxone (glatiramer)
from Jun 2004 to Sep 2005. The patient tested positive for anti-JCV antibodies in Jul 2011, which was the reason 
for discontinuation of TYSABRI.  In Mar 2015, the patient commenced Gilenya (fingolimod).  At the same time 
(presume Mar 2015), a brain MRI showed a new non-enhancing T2 lesion; the location of the lesion was consistent 
with the clinical appearance of PML at the moment. The neurologist assessed the PML as very likely associated 
with TYSABRI.
Update 16 Jun 2015:  Additional information was provided by the hospital neurologist reported via phone.  Patient's 
initials were further clarified and date of birth was provided.  The patient received a total of 75 doses of TYSABRI 
from 02 Nov 2007 (date discrepant) to 25 Feb 2015 (date discrepant).  Serum anti JCV antibody titer was 
qualitatively positive in Jul 2011 (previously reported); a quantitative analysis of the titer had not been performed.
At that time, TYSABRI therapy had been continued due to the patient's urgent wish.  TYSABRI therapy was 
switched to Gilenya therapy due to therapeutic considerations and the neurological hospital's previous experience 
with PML in MS patients on TYSABRI therapy.  Gilenya therapy was started on 17 Mar 2015 and discontinued on 
25 May 2015.  A brain MRI performed at the time of therapy change in Mar 2015 (previously reported) already 
showed a newly occurred non contrast medium enhancing lesion in the right temporal region, i.e. at the localization 
of the current PML, which was interpreted as a new MS lesion at that time, further supporting the decision for 
therapy change. CSF JCV DNA result was not available to the neurologist however, the neurologist heard that the 
analysis resulted in approximately 200 copies/ml (date unknown).  MRI control performed on (b) (6)  did not 
reveal any significant changes, but displayed image morphologically IRIS and a questionable new MS lesion.  MRI 
control performed on (b) (6)  did not show any significant changes of the lesions in the white matter, but 
slightly improved findings.  The patient was discharged on (b) (6)  but again re-hospitalized via emergency 
unit on the same evening due to a questionable epileptic seizure; differential diagnosis was panic attack (onset 
unknown).  EEG (date unknown) did not provide any evidence of epilepsy. Previously, the patient had experienced 
syncope 2 times (onset unknown).  The patient experienced questionable IRIS as the MRI on (b) (6)  showed 
aspects of an IRIS with only slight compression and the image of decreasing PML. Clinically, the patient was 
relatively normal.  According to the neurologist, the patient's symptoms leading to the diagnosis of PML had started 
in Apr 2015. The neurologist stated that the patient had shown only few clinical signs and symptoms considering

the massive MRI findings. The patient was treated with 5 cycles of plasmapheresis from 26 May 2015 to 08 Jun 
2015.  Additional treatment included maraviroc, mefloquine, Remergil (mirtazapine), fluoxetine, Keppra 
(levetiracetam), and Pantozol (pantoprazole).  The neurologist stated that MRI controls are performed routinely 
every 6 months in TYSABRI treated MS patients when the JCV antibody status is positive and the treatment 
duration was longer than 2 years. Otherwise, MRI controls were performed yearly.  JCV antibody status is 
monitored every 6 months.  Previous MRI controls had been performed in this patient on 19 Sep 2014 (results not 
provided) and 06 Mar 2015 (presume in reference to previously reported brain MRI performed in Mar 2015).
According to the neurologist previous data were difficult to retrieve in the hospital's archive system.  The patient 
was included in the (b) (6)  study (Gilenya) and had previously participated in the (b) (6)  study.
Update 18 Jun 2015:  Upon internal review, this case has been confirmed for PML based on positive CSF, 
consistent MRI findings, and clinical symptoms.
Update 18 Jun 2015: Additional information was provided by a different neurologist.  Symptoms which led to PML 
suspicion initially included amnesic aphasia with no epileptic seizures at the beginning, but were observed during a 
monitoring visit for Gilenya therapy with the patient's neurologist.  Additional symptoms which led to PML suspicion 
included headache, exhaustibility, and gait disorder.  The patient experienced IRIS verified mainly by MR imaging 
(previously reported), however, clinical symptoms could not be clearly assigned to IRIS.  MRI reports from (b) (6)  
(b) (6)  and (b) (6)  were provided (results previously provided).  Cranial MRI from (b) (6)  was compared 
to the previous external MRI from 27 May 2015.  In the short-term course, no significant changes were seen.  There
were continuously extensive changes in the white matter subcortically in the right temporal lobe.  Considering the 
image morphology, this was most likely corresponding to an IRIS within the scope of PML. The other lesions more 
pronounced on the left-frontal side were largely constant. A questionable new, most likely demyelinating 
inflammatory lesion in the right white matter within the scope of MS was seen. The slight mass effect with 
compression of the right lateral ventricle was unchanged.  Cranial MRI from (b) (6)  was compared to the 
previous MRI from (b) (6)   In the short-term course, no significant changes of the extensive multifocal 
changes in the white matter most likely compatible with PML/IRIS were seen. The right central inflammatory lesion 
having been displayed in the previous MRI was no longer evidenced in the current MRI.  LP was performed on 28 
May 2015 and results of CSF JCV DNA was 284 copies (presume copies/ml) at a local lab (presume in reference 
to CSF JCV DNA testing previously reported with result of approximately 200 copies/ml).  A control LP was 
performed on (b) (6)  and [CSF JCV DNA] results were pending.  Currently, the patient was still in hospital but 
should be discharged soon, she was clinically stable. The patient had already been discharged on (b) (6)  but
was re-hospitalized on the same evening due to an epileptic seizure (previously reported as questionable epileptic 
seizure; differential diagnosis was panic attack). Subsequently, the patient was treated with Keppra.

indicates that a physician reported that the female patient experienced PML (onset 2015; discrepant from 
previously reported Feb 2015).  A JC-virus DNA test was positive, showing 400 copies.  The physician reported that
the lesion found on the Mar 2015 MRI was prior to her Gilenya (fingolimod) treatment therefore, PML was already 
present prior to starting treatment with Gilenya (fingolimod).  No causality assessment, seriousness assessment, or
action taken was explicity reported for PML in relation to Gilenya (fingolimod).  The patient's condition was reported 
as "good according to circumstances" and was not recovered yet.
Update 27 Nov 2015: Additional information was received from the hospital neurologist via a MS Standardized PML
Data Collection Tool. The patient is alive, residing at home and is not currently on MS therapy. The neurologist 
assessed the patient's EDSS score on 28 Sep 2015 to be 2.5. The patient's most recent cranial MRI was 
performed on 24 Nov 2015 compared to previous MRI from 28 Sep 2015 (results not provided) with following 
results:  regression of the right-hemispheric PML manifestation. The left frontal and left pre central PML 
manifestations were constantly displayed. Currently no evidence of contrast medium enhancement, in this respect 
no evidence of IRIS. The chronically inflammatory lesions in the area of the corpus callosum and juxtacortical were 
unchanged and without signs of floridity.  Test results from 24 Nov 2015 include: leukocytes of 9300 l/ul (normal 
range 4100 - 11800), lymphocytes of 20.8 % (normal range 20 - 40), absolute lymphocytes of 1.93 (1.0 - 3.5), 
absolute eosinophils of 0.0 (normal range 0.03 - 0.47), eosinophils of  0.0 % (normal range 1.0 - 4.0), absolute 
basophil of 0.01 (normal range 0.02 - 0.11),  hematocrit of 32.6 % (normal range 32.0 - 47.0), hemoglobin of 10.0 
g/dl (12.0 - 16.0), MCH of 18.8 pg (normal range 27.0 - 34.0), MCHC of 30.7 g/dl (normal range 32.0 - 36.0), MCV 
of 61.3 fl (normal range 80 - 93), red cell distribution width (RDW) of 17.9 % (normal range < 15), C-reactive protein
of 0.99 mg/dl (normal range <0.50), and CK of 266 u/l (normal range <170).  The neurologist assessed the patient's
Karnofsky score on 27 Nov 2015 to be 90 (able to carry on normal activity; minor signs or symptoms of disease). 
The patient has no new onset of IRIS since last report. The patient did not receive corticosteroids pre-IRIS or post-
IRIS. Treatment post-IRIS included the following: plasmapheresis from 30 May 2015 to 08 Jun 2015, maraviroc 
from 30 May 2015 to unknown date, mefloquine from 30 May 2015 to unknown date, and Mirtazapine from 30 May 
2015 to unknown date. The neurologist assessed on 28 Sep 2015 the patient's IRIS was recovered with sequelae. 
As of this report, the patient's PML outcome was recovered with sequelae.  The causality of the events of PML and 
IRIS was assessed as unknown.
