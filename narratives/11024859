Medically Significant
A neurologist spontaneously reported that an adult female patient on TYSABRI (300 mg, IV, QM) for relapsing 
remitting Multiple Sclerosis from 2007 to Jun 2014 experienced suspicion of PML (onset Sep 2014).  The 
neurologist noted that the suspicion of PML was based on MRI findings. TYSABRI was previously discontinued as 
the patient had three known PML risk factors: prior use of immunosuppressive agent (mitoxantrone on unknown 
date), TYSABRI treatment duration greater than 2 years and positive anti-JCV antibody serology with index value of
more than 2. The patient was then switched to TECFIDERA in Jun 2014. Common clinical practices included brain 
MRI completion every 3 months to monitor PML risk. The MRI performed in Sep 2014 revealed PML suspected 
lesion. The patient is currently asymptomatic. A lumbar puncture was planned for 16 Sep 2014 and CSF samples 
will be sent to local lab for JCV PCR testing. The patient'slymphocytes were more than 500 on a recent biological 
checkup (date unknown). At the time of this report, action taken with TECFIDERA was unknown. The event of 
suspicion of PML is ongoing. The causality for the event of suspicion of PML is unknown.  TYSABRI therapy was 
previously discontinued. French Imputability: C2S1I1

Update 19 Sep 2014: The neurologist reported that TECFIDERA was withdrawn on 09 Sep 2014. He didn't think 
that the event suspicion of PML was due to TECFIDERA unlike TYSABRI. No further information was provided. 
French Imputability C2 S1 I1
Update 24 Sep 2014: The neurologist reported that JCV [DNA] PCR testing came back negative from a local lab. 
The neurologist planned to send CSF smaple for (b) (6)  for a new JCV [DNA] PCR testing. French Imputability: C1 
S1 I1 
Update 17 Oct 2014: The neurologist reported that the female patient was born on (b) (6)  A lumbar puncture 
was scheduled on 19 Oct 2014 in order to send CSF to (b) (6)  for JCV PCR testing. At the time of reporting, the 
patient was doing well, she only presented with a curious shiver which was decreasing (NOS). No further 
information has been reported. French Imputability: C1 S1 I1
Update 05 Nov 2014: The neurologist reported, via a Biogen Account Business Manager, that the patient was doing
well but he had not received the result of JCV PCR testing from (b) (6) .  No further information was 
reported. French Imputability: C1S1I1
Update 07 Nov 2014: Follow up received from (b) (6)  indicated the result of JCV PCR was negative.
No further information was reported. French Imputability: C1S1I1
Update 02 Dec 2014: The neurologist spontaneously reported that a brain MRI has been scheduled on 02 Dec 
2014. French Imputability: C1S1I1
Update 15 Jan 2015: Follow-up information was received from the neurologist, via an Account Business Manager.
Following PML suspicion, MRIs were done every 2 weeks in Sep and Oct 2014 (results not provided). MRI 
monitoring is ongoing.  At the time of reporting, the patient was asymptomatic but the PML suspicion persisted 
based on MRI images (NOS).  A lumbar puncture will be consequently planned next week in order to send CSF to 
(b) (6)  for JCV PCR testing. No further information was provided.  French imputability: C1 S1 I1
Update 23 Jan 2015: Follow-up information was received from a nurse.  Lumbar puncture performed on 20 Oct 
2014 (previously reported as 19 Oct 2014) will not be sent to (b) (6)  for JCV PCR in CSF because CSF samples 
were stored improperly. Subsequently, another lumbar puncture is planned shortly. No further information was 
provided. French Imputability: C1S1I1
Update 30 Jan 2015: The nurse reported that a lumbar puncture should be planned on 04 Feb 2015 in order to 
send CSF to (b) (6)  for JCV PCR testing. No further information was provided. French Imputability : C1 S1 I1

Update 19 Feb 2015: Follow-up information was received from the neurologist via an account business manager. 
JCV PCR testing in CSF came back negative from (b) (6)  Despite the 2 negative results ((b) (6) S and (b) (6) ),
PML diagnosis was not excluded. According to a referent neurologist working at the hospital where the MRI 
monitoring is done, the patient presented with PML due to MRI images.  MRI images will be provided. Since 
TECFIDERA stop in Sep 2014, the patient did not receive any MS disease-modifying drug. However, as she 
experienced again MS relapses (NOS), the neurologist is considering resuming TECFIDERA. French imputability: 
C1S1I1.
Update 23 Feb 2015: The neurologist reported that a MRI was done on 16 Feb 2015 in another hospital. He will 
send us a copy of the MRI images as soon as he receives the CD Rom. No further information was provided. 
French Imputability : C1 S1 I1
Update 05 Mar 2015: Follow-up information was received from a neurologist with expertise in PML who has 
assessed the MRIs as showing PML lesions. No new lumbar puncture is planned. French Imputability : C1 S1 I1
Update 09 Mar 2015: Follow-up information received from the neurologist clarified that the neurologist thinks the 
patient has a PML because of MRI images even if the JCV testing is negative. The diagnosis is only based on MRI. 
As of 19 Feb 2015, the patient had not received any MS treatment, but the neurologist is thinking of resuming 
TECFIDERA as the patient experienced again MS relapses. French Imputability : C1 S1 I1
Update 30 Mar 2015: Follow-up information was received from the neurologist. Lymphocytes counts were regularly 
performed. In Sep 2013, lymphocyte count was 2601 (units and reference range not provided), in  Apr 2014 was 
2905 (upon discontinuation of TYSABRI) and on 11 Sep 2014 was 1000 (the day after stopping Tecfidera). The 
lymphocytes subsets counts (NOS) were only done at TYSABRI start (results not provided). Tecfidera was 
discontinued around 10 Sep 2014 and re-started in Mar 2015. At the time of the report, the patient was 
asymptomatic. The three CSF JCV tests were negative (local laboratory, (b) (6)  and (b) (6) ). According to two other 
neurologists, PML was considered the most likely diagnosis. No specific treatment was given. Additionally, the 
neurologist agreed to provide the images of the MRI performed on 16 Feb2015. French Imputability: C1S1I1.
Update 02 Apr 2015: Follow-up information received from the neurologist included MRI report from 16 Feb 2015: 
The exam was perfectly stable compared to the previous MRI which revealed T2 hyperpersignals of periventricular 
and subcortical white matter reaching U fibers in the extended right central part of the right vertex to the opercular 
region. The venous bold sequence found T2* hyposignal in the two pre central areas in the cortical level with a 
predominance of the right pre central region. Some T2 hypersignals compared to right pre central region. No T2 
hypersignal appeared in the left pre-central region. After injection of contrast agent, these abnormal T2 areas didn't 
took the contrast. It was found an extra-axial lesion type meningioma of the left tentorium cerebelli exersing a mass

Update 16 April 2015: Upon internal review, Biogen considers this case downgraded to low suspect for PML  as the
MD did not exclude PML and considers it as PML based on MRI. French Imputability: C1S1I1
