A neurologist from the neurology department of a university hospital spontaneously reported that a male patient 
(approximately 44 years old) on TYSABRI (unknown dose, unknown route, unknown frequency) for Multiple 
Sclerosis from Dec 2010 to 09 May 2014 (total of 41 monthly injections) was hospitalized from(b) (6)  to an 
unknown date for suspected PML (onset Jun 2014). The patient was first diagnosed with multiple sclerosis in 2010. 
The patient is presenting with hypoesthesia of the left leg and residual left-sided hemiataxia with no new symptoms 
so far. A liquor puncture was performed on (b) (6)  and the CSF sample was requested to be sent to (b) (6)  for 
JC virus determination on the same day.  The patient was suspected for PML based on MRI images from (b) (6)  
 which revealed T2 lesions of the left gyrus para hippocampalis had increased in size.  Plasmapheresis is 
planned.  The event of suspected PML is ongoing. The causality for the event of suspected PML is unknown.  It is 
unknown if TYSABRI treatment is ongoing.

Upgrade 14 Jul 2014: Additional information was provided by the neurologist.  The patient was diagnosed with MS 
in Nov 2010 and is currently at home. MS symptoms prior to PML diagnosis included subjective decrease of 
strength in third to fifth toes on the left (onset Jun 2010) and residual hypoesthesia of the size of the palm on the left
lateral upper thigh (onset Jun 2010). No prior immunosuppressant therapy was noted. The patient had previously 
received immunomodulatory therapy with Copaxone (glatiramer) for MS from Aug 2010 to Dec 2010.  The patient's 
weight (at or around the time of PML diagnosis) was 80 kg.  The patient was asymptomatic.   Lumbar puncture was
performed on 10 Jun 2014 and the CSF sample was tested on the same day at USZ and possibly the same day at 
(b) (6)   CSF JCV DNA results were positive from USZ at 16,359 copies/ml and (b) (6)  at 37,476 copies/ml. Analysis of 
CSF on 10 Jun 2014 revealed oligoclonal bands, but negative in serum and positive intrathecal IgM synthesis.  At 
the time of this report, no additional lumbar punctures or testing for anti-natalizumab antibodies were performed. No
brain biopsy was performed. The patient tested negative for HIV on 10 Jun 2014.  MRI at the time of PML diagnosis
was performed on 07 Jun 2014 (results previously reported) and MRI prior to PML diagnosis was performed on 16 
May 2014 (results not provided).  Patient's Karnofsky scores were 100% (prior to starting TYSABRI on 15 Nov 
2010), 90% (on TYSABRI prior to PML on 18 Mar 2014), and 90% (at time of PML diagnosis on 25 Jun 2014). 
Patient's EDSS was 1.0 (prior to starting TYSABRI on 13 Dec 2010), 1.5 (on TYSABRI prior to PML on 18 Mar 
2014), and 1.5 (at time of PML diagnosis on 25 Jun 2014).  The patient tested positive for anti-JCV antibody on 21 
Jul 2011 (no index provided) and 10 Oct 2013 (index = 1,291) at (b) (6)  Stratify.  CBC pre-TYSABRI on 16 Nov 
2010 revealed Hg [hemoglobin] 16.6 g/dl, thrombocytes 284 g/l, leukocytes 6.37 g/l, and normal differential; CBC 
pre-PLEX on 10 Jun 2014 revealed Hg 145 g/l, thrombocytes 192 g/l, and leukocytes 6.54 g/l (reference ranges not
provided).  A normal CD4/8 ratio of 2:1 was noted on 11 Jun 2014 (pre-PLEX).   PML treatment included 5 sessions
of plasma exchange (PLEX) on 11 Jun 2014 (volume 3500 ml), 13 Jun 2014 (volume 4000 ml), 16 Jun 2014 
(volume 4000 ml), 18 Jun 2014 (volume 4000 ml), and 19 Jun 2014 (volume 4000 ml), mefloquine, mirtazapine, 
and Keppra (levetiracetam). The event of PML is not recovered and the causality of PML in relation to TYSABRI 
was assessed as related.  The patient started on TYSABRI on 13 Dec 2010 and discontinued on 09 May 2014.
Update 07 Aug 2014:  Additional information was received from the neurologist from the university hospital.  The 
patient on TYSABRI (300 mg, IV, Q4W), who was diagnosed with RRMS in Jul 2010, was first diagnosed with PML 
in Jun 2014 based on morphology on MRI and JCV test by (b) (6)  (37,476 copies/ml).  Neuropsychological testing in 
Jul 2014 showed medium-severe cognitive deficits in verbal - episodic memory and word finding disorder. A  brain 
MRI in Jul 2014 showed left temporal hyperintense signal abnormality matching an IRIS (onset Jul 2014). 
Treatment included plasmapheresis and Solu-Medrol (methylprednisolone) which was switched to Medrol 
(methylprednisolone). On 07 Aug 2014, an additional lumbar puncture was performed and the neurologist 
requested JCV testing by the (b) (6)
Update 01 Oct 2014: Additional information was provided by the neurologist from the university hospital.  CSF 
sample was shipped to the (b) (6)  for JC virus determination. Sampling occurred on 01 Oct 2014. It was noted on the

(b) (6)  form that the 44 year old patient was diagnosed with MS in Nov 2010 and with PML in Jun 2014.  The patient 
had presented with temporal mnestic deficits, taste disorders, fatigue, epilepsy and hypoesthesia and underwent 5 
sessions of PLEX in Jul 2014. According to the neurologist, the patient was on TYSABRI from Dec 2010 to 05 May 
2014 (date discrepant).
Update 20 Nov 2014: Upon internal review, Biogen Idec considers this case to be a confirmed case of PML based 
on positive CSF, radiologic evidence, and clinical symptoms.
Update 27 Jan 2015: Additional information was received from a neurologist via a MS Standardized PML Data 
Collection Tool. Functional scores were reported as follows: Karnofsky 90 (able to carry on normal activity; minor 
signs or symptoms of disease) and EDSS 1.0 on 13 Dec 2010; Karnofsky 90 and EDSS 1.5 on 09 May 2014; 
Karnofsky 90 and EDSS 1.5 on 10 Jun 2014. The following labs were reported: lymphocyte count 1.52 G/L (normal 
range 1.5-4 G/L) on 16 Nov 2010; lymphocyte count 2.13 G/L on 10 Jun 2014; leukocyte count 7.18 G/L (normal 
range 3.0-9.6 G/L) and lymphocyte count 1.95 G/L on 25 Jun 2014. A lumbar puncture was performed on 07 Aug 
2014 and was positive for CSF JCV DNA at 809 copies per mL. A lumbar puncture was performed on 01 Oct 2014 
and was positive for CSF JCV DNA at 13 copies per mL ((b) (6) ). A brain MRI was performed prior to PML diagnosis 
on 16 May 2014. The diagnosis of IRIS was determined by MRI findings and clinical symptoms, which included 
mnestic deficits and finding the correct words (cognitive/behavioral) and speech with an onset date on 08 Jul 2014, 
and suspicious episodes of seizure (onset date 05 Aug 2014). The patient did not receive corticosteroids pre-IRIS 
onset. Treatment for IRIS included SoluMedrol 1 GM IV daily from 08 Jul 2014 to 10 Jul 2014, and Medrol 100 mg 
tapered to 2 mg daily PO since 11 Jul 2014. Currently, the patient is alive and is residing at home. As of 17 Nov 
2014, the patient has not recovered from PML and has not recovered from IRIS. Causality for the events of PML 
and IRIS was assessed as related to TYSABRI.
Update 24 Feb 2015:  Follow-up information was received from the neurologist who requested JCV DNA liquor 
testing (date of LP/ CSF sample not provided). Shipment date to (b) (6)  is foreseen for Monday 02 Mar 2015. No 
further information was provided.
