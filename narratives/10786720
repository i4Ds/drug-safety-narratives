Medically Significant
A neurologist spontaneously reported via a Biogen Idec Medical Science Liaison (MSL) that a female patient on 
TYSABRI (300 mg, IV, QM) for Multiple Sclerosis from unknown date to unknown date experienced suspect PML 
(onset Jan 2015).  On 28 Jan 2015 the patient had a lumbar puncture and CSF JCV DNA ((b) (6) ) was pending at the 
time of this report. The neurologist indicated that the patient experienced severe ataxia and cerebellar atrophy 
(presumed symptoms of suspect PML); however the MSL did not know the dates the symptoms began or what 
treatment was given. The MSL indicated that the patient may have received steroids (NOS). The event of suspect 
PML is ongoing. The causality for the event of suspect PML was assessed as related.  It is unknown if TYSABRI 
treatment is ongoing.
Update 30 Jan 2015: The female patient on TYSABRI from 25 Oct 2006 to 26 Dec 2014 reported via a program of 
Monitored Therapy that she experienced MS Attached (presume MS attack) characterized by cerebellar ataxia 
(onset unknown; previously reported as suspect PML characterized by severe ataxia and cerebellar atrophy). 
Internal databases indicated that the patient's MS symptoms began on 10 Jul 2001. Previous MS therapies 
included Copaxone (glatiramer acetate) from Jun 2002 to Aug 2006. Immunosuppressant history is unknown. The 
patient is enrolled in(b) (6)  At the time of this report, the TOUCH database indicated 
that the patient had received a total of 99 TYSABRI infusions from 25 Oct 2006 to 26 Dec 2014. It is unclear 
whether the patient received any TYSABRI infusions prior to enrollment in the TOUCH program. The patient 
reported that her infusions were on hold right now, with her last infusion on 26 Dec 2014. The patient indicated that,
for the last several months, the reported event had gotten worse and that she is currently bedridden. Testing 
included a cerebral spinal fluid check for PML (presume reference to previous CSF JCV DNA test). Treatment for 
the event was not provided and the event is ongoing. Causality was not assessed by the patient. TYSABRI therapy 
was stopped temporarily.
Update 30 Jan 2015: Upon follow-up, it was determined that case # 2015BI002281 is a duplicate of case # 
2015BI013650. The following information in [ ] was previously reported in case 2015BI002281:
[A neurologist reported that a 45 year old female patient on TYSABRI (300 mg, IV, QM) for Multiple Sclerosis from 
an unknown date to an unknown date and since 25 Oct 2006 had cerebellar degeneration on MRI (Magnetic 
Resonance Imaging) (onset 05 Jan 2015). Treatment was not provided. The event is ongoing and causality was not
assessed. TYSABRI therapy continues.]
Update 10 Feb 2015: The following serum JCV antibody results were obtained from the (b) (6)
(b) (6) ): 22 Dec 2010 = detected, 1.281 nOD-38; 25 Jan 2012 = detected, 1.362 nOD-38.

FOIA Case Report Information
Update 06 Feb 2015: The female patient reported via a program of Monitored Therapy that she experienced a 
severe attack of cerebellar ataxia, balance problems, cannot sit, and cannot stand (onset Dec 2014; presumed 
symptoms of previously reported suspect PML). The patient indicated that she cannot sit or stand without help. The 
patient reported that this may possibly be related to PML or the JC Virus and noted that she is waiting for the results
of her tests "next week." At the time of this report the patient's symptoms of cerebellar ataxia and balance problems
were ongoing, and her TYSABRI infusions had been postponed. No additional information was provided. 
Update 14 Feb 2015: Upon follow-up from the neurologist, the neurologist reported that the female patient does not
have PML, but Cerebellar Vermis Degeneration from JCV induced cerebellar granule cell neuronopathy (onset 
unknown). The patient's last infusion (presume TYSABRI) was 28 Dec 2014 (discrepant information; last dose per 
TOUCH was 26 Dec 2014). The patient's last MRI on 15 Dec 2014 did not show any evidence of PML and was 
reviewed by both the neurologist and a neuroradiologist. It did show selective degeneration of the cerebellar vermis,
which the neurologist noted is a much more common target than the white matter in PML. The neurologist stated 
that the patient had a CSF sample collected on 28 Jan 2015, which tested positive for CSF JCV DNA (local and 
(b) (6) ). The patient's last JCV index was also done on 28 Jan 2015 and it was positive as she had been all along. 
The patient did not receive any PLEX therapy since the last infusion was nearly 6 weeks prior to the CSF results. 
The neurologist indicated that the patient was starting to get some fatigue, thus an MRI was scheduled for 2 weeks 
from now in anticipation of IRIS. At the time of this report, the patient was stable with no appreciable weakness, just
more ataxia and was walking with a cane and walker only when she felt more fatigue. The patient is scheduled to 
receive her first dose of mefloquine 250mg on 15 Feb 2015, which will be given once a week over 8 weeks. The 
patient will have an MRI done at week 4, with a CSF collection repeated at week 8. Depending on the results of the 
CSF, the neurologist may continue the mefloquine for longer treatment. Causality for the event was not assessed 
by the neurologist. 
Update 18 Feb 2015: Upon telephone follow-up with the neurologist's office, a medical assistant reported that the 
patient's last MRI was on 17 Dec 2014 (discrepant information; previously reported as 15 Dec 2014). The medical 
assistant did not have a MRI report from Jan 2015 and did not know the copy numbers for the CSF JCV DNA ((b) (6) )
and CSF JCV DNA (local) lab results, but knew that they were both positive. 
Update 18 Feb 2015: Upon faxed follow-up from the neurologist's office, the neurologist forwarded a MRI report, 
which provided the following results: Head MRI on 17 Dec 2014, w/out contrast, compared to 25 Apr 2014: Again 
multiple T2/FLAIR hyperintense lesions in supratentorial white matter, similar to prior exam. Overall plaque burden 
not significantly changed, consistent with /MS. There is a slightly progressive vermian atrophy of unknown etiology. 
No diffusion restriction is evident, no hemorrhagic breakdown products on the gradient echo sequence, no definite 
enhancing abnormalities were seen.

FOIA Case Report Information
Update 18 Feb 2015: The patient on TYSABRI for relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis spontaneously reported via 
a Biogen Idec representative that she was hospitalized (dates of hospitalization not provided) for a brain infection 
caused by JCV, but not PML (onset unknown; presume reference to cerebellar vermis degeneration from JCV 
induced cerebellar granule cell neuronopathy). The event is ongoing. No additional information was provided.
Update 26 Feb 2015: The female patient reported via a program of Monitored Therapy that her CSF was positive 
for JCV. The patient indicated that she was being treated for it (NOS) to "try and clear it up." The patient also noted 
that it was not PML. TYSABRI therapy was discontinued. No further information was provided.
Update 03 Mar 2015: Upon follow-up with neurologist via a Biogen Idec MSL, the CSF JCV DNA ((b) (6) ) laboratory 
results,  were positive at 32,734 copies/ml. 
Update 12 Mar 2015: On 12 Mar 2015, Biogen Idec considers this case to be confirmed for PML based on positive 
CSF, consistent MRI findings, and clinical symptoms.
