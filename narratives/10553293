Medically Significant
A neurologist spontaneously reported via a Biogen Idec employee (sales representative) that a  37 year old male 
patient on TYSABRI (300 mg, IV, QM) for relapsing remitting Multiple Sclerosis from unknown date to unknown 
date experienced suspicion of PML (onset unknown). According to the neurologist, the patient had received a total 
of 52 doses of TYSABRI infusion at the time of this report. Relapsing remitting MS was diagnosed in 2008. The 
patient had not had any other immunosuppressant therapies before and was positive for anti JCV antibodies. The 
suspicion of PML was based on the incidental finding of a lesion in posterior horn lateral ventricle left on an 
unknown date. A lumbar puncture would be performed. The event of suspicion of PML is ongoing. The causality for 
the event of suspicion of PML is unknown.  It is unknown if TYSABRI treatment is ongoing.

employee (sales representative) that the diagnosis of PML was "confirmed" in a hospital and the patient had been 
discharged (presumed being hospitalized for suspicion of PML) from the hospital in the meantime. At the time of 
this report, the patient was in a rehabilitation facility.  There is no hospital discharge letter as well as no CSF JCV 
PCR test results available. No further information was provided.
Update 17 Oct 2014: The treating neurologist from the university hospital reported that the patient on TYSABRI 
infusions (300 mg, IV, QM) for RRMS from May 2010 to 11 Jul 2014 was hospitalized for PML twice: from (b) (6)  
(b) (6)  to (b) (6)  and from (b) (6)  to (b) (6)  The patient had received a total of 53 doses of 
TYSABRI infusions. The patient was diagnosed with RRMS in 2003 and was previously treated with Copaxone 
(glatiramer) from 2005 to 2008 and with Rebif (interferon beta-1a) from 2008 to 2010. The patient had not received 
any previous immunosuppressive treatment. The most recent EDSS (date unknown, presumably before onset of 
PML) was 2.5. The patient presented with newly occurred sensory disturbances affecting his face on the left side 
(onset unknown). On 17 Jul 2014, MRI brain was done in an outpatient setting revealed in comparison with MRI 
from Apr 2014 one new demyelinating lesion in the cerebellum on the right side as well as increase of signal 
enhancement occipito-temporal on the left side seen in T2, both without contrast enhancement. The patient was 
tested positive for JCV DNA in serum and was admitted to the hospital for CSF diagnostics and confirmation of 
PML diagnosis on (b) (6)  CSF examination on (b) (6)  without pathological findings except of JCV DNA 
PCR of 377 copies/ml.  JCV DNA PCR in serum was 570 copies/ml on the same date. The patient received five 
cycles of immunoadsorption in Aug 2014 as well as therapy with both mirtazapine (45 mg QD) and Maraviroc (300 
mg BID) since Aug 2014. On(b) (6)  the patient was transferred to the rehabilitation facility. On(b) (6)
CSF JCV DNA PCR revealed 366 copies/ml; serum JCV DNA PCR revealed 900 copies/ml. MRI brain performed 
on (b) (6)  showed no significant changes compared with previous examination. No evidence of florid 
inflammatory activity, no diffusion disturbance. MRI brain done on (b) (6)  revealed no progress of known 
PML lesion. No evidence of florid inflammatory activity. The patient was admitted to the hospital for follow up with 
deterioration of cognitive functions, mild increasing of latent hemiparesis on the right side on (b) (6)  and was 
diagnosed with severe IRIS in (b) (6)  MRI brain done on (b) (6)  showed severe IRIS in the course of 
known PML with significant BBB disruption supra- and infratentorial. There were new florid lesions on both sides 
suspected being consistent with known MS. Brain MRI done on (b) (6)  revealed further progression of 
extensive lesions supra- and infratentorial consistent with known IRIS. However, supratentorial BBB disruption were
regressive and infratentorial BBB disruption was almost completely resolved. On (b) (6)  CSF JCV DNA PCR
revealed 255 copies/ml; serum JCV DNA PCR revealed 375 copies/ml. Due to MRI findings, cortisone pulse 
therapy was commenced. The patient was treated with cortisone pulse therapy (Urbason 1000 mg IV QD) for IRIS 
for five days in (b) (6)  with subsequent tapering of dose orally. The patient continued receiving all other 
treatment. Copaxone was started for MS on an unknown date. The outcome for the events of PML and IRIS was 
not provided. The causality for the events was not assessed.

Update 22 Oct 2014: Additional information was provided by the neurologist. The CSF JCV DNA PCR testing 
(results reported previously) had been performed at the (b) (6)  The patient was 
transferred to the rehabilitation facility after the hospitalization and was doing well at the time of this report. 
Update 23 Oct 2014: Upon internal review, Biogen Idec considers this case to be a confirmed case of PML based 
on positive MRI, positive CSF and clinical symptoms. 
Update 27 Oct 2014: The reporting physician provided cranial MRI reports. External cranial MRI scan from 17 Jul 
2014 was compared with the scans from 30 Apr 2014, and showed an increase of the subcortical signal 
enhancement in the left occipito-temporal region was found. It was widespread and did not uptake contrast 
medium. By means of imaging morphology an incipient PML could not be excluded with definite certainty. A 
diffusion weighted sequence for further classification was not performed. Cranial MRI on (b) (6)  showed no 
significant change of findings. Cranial MRI on (b) (6)  compared with several previous MRI scans, showed no
progression of the known PML and no evidence of a florid inflammatory activity.  Cranial MRI on (b) (6)  was 
consistent with a pronounced immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) with known PML and with 
pronounced barrier disturbance in the supratentorial and infra-tentorial region. New florid lesions at both sides 
suspected to be MS associated.  Cranial MRI on (b) (6)  showed widespread lesions in the supra- and infra-
tentorial region which seem to be progressing, however, the barrier disturbance in the supra-tentorial region was 
regressive, and was nearly completely resolved in the infra-tentorial region.
Update 24 Nov 2014: Additional information was received from a neurologist via MS Standardized PML Data 
Collection Tool. The patient is alive, residing at home, and is not currently on any MS therapy.  The patient was 
diagnosed with IRIS by clinical symptoms including cognitive / behavioral, focal motor, and cerebellar (onsets(b) (6)  
(b) (6) ) and MRI findings. The neurologist assessed the patient?s estimated Karnofsky and EDSS scores in 2010 
(prior to starting TYSABRI) to be 70 (cares for self; unable to carry on normal activity or to do active work) and 2.5; 
2012 (on TYSABRI prior to PML) to be 80 (normal activity with effort; some signs or symptoms of disease) and 2.5; 
and (b) (6)  (at the time of PML diagnosis) to be 80 (normal activity with effort; some signs or symptoms of 
disease) and 2.5. The patient has been tested for serum anti-JCV antibodies on unknown date; results not 
provided. On (b) (6)  at time of PML (pre-PLEX) the patient's leukocyte count was 8000 (normal range 3500 - 
9000). An HIV test was done on (b) (6)  and was negative. The patient underwent a lumbar puncture on (b) (6)  
(b) (6) with results reported as positive for CSF JCV DNA at 366 copies per mL. The patient underwent a lumbar 
puncture on (b) (6)  with results reported as positive for CSF JCV DNA at 255 copies per mL. The patient did 
not receive corticosteroids pre-IRIS onset. The patient has received corticosteroids post-IRIS onset including 
methylprednisolone 1 gram for five day starting in(b) (6)  and methylprednisolone initial 60 mg decreasing to 
20 mg for five days starting (b) (6)   As of 24 Oct 2014, the patient has not recovered from PML and has 
recovered from IRIS. Causality for the events was assessed as related to TYSABRI.

Update 13 Mar 2015: Additional information was received from a neurologist via MS Standardized PML Data 
Collection Tool. The patient is alive, residing at home, and is currently on Copaxone (started Sep 2014) for 
preventative MS therapy. On 29 Jan 2015, the neurologist assessed the estimated Karnofsky score to be 80 
(normal activity with effort; some signs or symptoms of disease). A brain MRI was performed on 28 Jan 2015 
(compared to previous cranial MRI on 23 Oct 2014, results not provided) with results reported as follows: in 
consideration of the known IRIS after PML associated with Tysabri therapy due to MS barrier disturbance could no 
longer be evidenced except one very discrete enhancement of a lesion in the right periventricular white matter. The 
extensive supra- and infratentorial lesions were displayed largely unchanged. No newly occurred lesions. On 27 Jan
2015, the neurologist assessed the EDSS score to be 2.5. On 27 Jan 2015, the post-PML leukocyte count was 6.6 
x10(3)/microliter (normal range 3.5-9.8). IRIS symptoms included amnestic deficits and delusions 
(cognitive/behavioral), worsened right hemiparesis (motor-focal); and tremor in right hand (cerebellar), all with an 
onset date of (b) (6)  (discrepant from previous report). IRIS treatment was reported as follows: 
methylprednisolone 1 GM IV daily from (b) (6)  to (b) (6) ; methylprednisolone 60 mg (tapered to 
unspecified dose), daily by mouth from (b) (6)  to Oct 2014; maraviroc 300 mg twice daily by mouth from 20 
Jul 2014 to 27 Jan 2015; and maraviroc 150 mg twice daily by mouth ongoing since 28 Jan 2015. As of 27 Jan 
2015, the patient had recovered from PML and had not recovered from IRIS. Causality for the events was assessed
as related to TYSABRI.
