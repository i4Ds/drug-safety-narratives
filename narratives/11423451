On unknown dates, the patient experienced POSSIBLE PROGRESSIVE MULTIFOCAL 
LEUKOENCEPHALOPATHY, RED AND ITCHY DOT ON BREAST, WHEN SCRATCHED THE RED DOT IT 
BLED, EVERY TWO WEEKS DOSING OF HUMIRA WAS NOT CONTROLLING ARTHRITIS WELL and 
ARTHRITIS SYMPTOMS WERE RETURNING WITH EVERY TWO WEEKS DOSING.  In 2013, the patient 
experienced BRAIN FOG.  The physician was investigating her situation. She stated that on her breast she had a 
red dot that was itchy. When she scratched it bled and came back. The patient reported that since she started 
HUMIRA she had more brain fogs. The patient restarted treatment on 18 Aug 2014 (after being off treatment for 
three months, reason not available) and was injecting every two weeks.  In 2015, the patient experienced MEMORY
LOSS INCREASED and INCREASED CONFUSION/DESORGANISED.  The physician reported to sales 
representative that, the events of confusion, memory loss and disorganized had increased since the start of 
HUMIRA for patient. The dose change took place in 09 Mar 2015. The patient was injecting every two weeks until 
18 Aug 2014, Then she was switched to weekly on 13 Mar 2015. The patient reported that the reason for the dose 
change was because she had some memory problems that was getting a little better, so they wanted to see if 
HUMIRA was the cause. The patient was now back on every two weeks since about two weeks ago. The patient 
told her physician that she was doing better now. The patient had switched to weekly because she also has 
arthritis(before HUMIRA) and the every two weeks dosing was not controlling it well enough. After switching to 
weekly the patient's arthritis symptoms got much better but then she developed these neurological symptoms. Now 
that the patient was back on every two weeks her arthritis symptoms were returning. The patient's arthritis did not 
get worse after starting HUMIRA. The patient experienced confusion, memory loss, was desorganised following a

not think that HUMIRA was the cause. The physician was worried that it could be a progressive multifocal 
leukoencephalopathy as it was the first time she saw the patient like this. The physician evoked the possibility 
Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy in her differential diagnosis. The physician decreased HUMIRA dose 
to every two weeks, and the events recovered, patient came back to normal. The patient was return to every two 
weeks injection on 23 Jul 2015. A reduction of the dose of HUMIRA from weekly to every other week, the events of 
confusion, memory loss and disorganized had improved in the patient. The topic of PML was no longer mentioned. 
The sales representative reported that it was her impression that the idea of Progressive Multifocal 
Leukoencephalopathy seemed to had been ruled out following improvement of events but she did not want to 
confirm.  In 2015, the MEMORY LOSS INCREASED, INCREASED CONFUSION/DESORGANISED and 
POSSIBLE PROGRESSIVE MULTIFOCAL LEUKOENCEPHALOPATHY resolved.  The primary reporter declined 
to provide the lot number information. No further follow up information was available.
