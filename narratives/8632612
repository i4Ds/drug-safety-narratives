IMO 
A 76-year-old, Asian, male subject started to receive oral crizotinib (PF-02341066) from 28May2012 for non-small 
cell lung cancer (NSCLC) positive for the ALK fusion gene. The most recent dose before the event was 250 mg, 
twice daily. The subject had a history of lung cancer; the primary lesion was S6 in the right lung, metastasized to 
lymph nodes of the right hilum and mediastinal and subcutaneous tumor, Stage IV. No lobectomy was performed; a 
tissue biopsy from the skin for a diagnosis was performed on 220ct2011. On 05Jan2012, the subject was 
randomized to the treatment group with carboplatin and pemetrexed, and these study medications were started on 
the same day. The subject received 5 cycles of pemetrexed and carboplatin which were completed on 12Apr2012. 
On the subject was judged as progressive disease by central independent radiology review due to 
aggrav bcutaneous tumor, and S6 lesion was also enlarged. He consented for the cross-over in the trial 
after informed consent. 
The subject's medical history included allergic rhinitis ongoing since an unknown date, hypertension (under control 
with valsartan) ongoing since an unknown date, hepatitis C ongoing since an unknown date, prostatic hypertrophy 
(under control with tamsulosin hydrochloride) ongoing since an unknown date, and cancer pain (under control with 
loxoprofen and oxycodone) ongoing since an unknown date. The subject also had had a smoking history of 20 
cigarettes a day from when he was 28 to 65 years old, but he did not have any history of COPD (chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease), cardiac failure, pericardial effusion, or renal failure. 
Relevant concomitant medications included oral tamsulosin hydrochloride 0.2 mg once daily for prostatic 
hypertrophy, oral valsartan (DIOVAN) 80 mg once daily from 20Jan2012 for hypertension, oral loxoprofen 60 mg 
three times daily for cancer pain, oral lafutidine (PROTECADIN) 10 mg twice daily from 06Jan2012 for gastritis 
prophylaxis, oral carbazochrome sodium sulfonate (S. ADCHNON) 30 mg twice daily from 20Dec2011 for bloody 
sputum, oral tranexamic acid (TRANSAMIN) 250 mg twice daily from 20Dec2011 for bloody sputum, oral 
magnesium oxide (MAGMITT) 330 mg once daily from 08Jan2012 for constipation, oral oxycodone 15 mg twice 
daily from 14Feb2012 for cancer pain, oral sennoside A+B 12 mg once daily from 08Jan2012 for constipation, oral 
oxycodone hydrochloride hydrate (OXINORM) 10 mg as needed from 14Feb2012 for cancer pain. All concomitant 
medications were ongoing at the time of the event. 
On 01111111111the sub'ect had pyrexia (37.9 degrees centigrade) but he had no subjective symptom. After the 
evening meal on the subject had pyrexia (38.4 degrees centigrade) and delirium (slurred speech). 
During the afternoon of o alallia delirium was assessed as being was grade 1 and the subject 
was mentally stable. On the subject repeated initiating sleep and awaking during the night, and he

' continued to have delirium. From 6 pm one the subject had no delirium. Chest X-ray onJ  
showed no obvious pneumonia and enlarged lung tumor compared with the findings on MOM but the 
investigator did not consider that the findings on--suggested acute progression of lung tumor. CEA 
(Carcinoembryonic antigen) and SLX (Sialyl Lewis X-1 antigen) on 27Apr2012 were 26.0 and 86.2, respectively. On 
MOM the subject had no pyrexia and had recovered from delirium and the investigator assessed that the 
subject was mentally stable. On- blood lactate dehydrogenase was 307 1U/L (normal range 119 - 229), 
C-reactive protein (CRP) was 2.67 mg/di (normal range 0 - 0.3), and white blood cell (WBC) count was 7070/mm3 
(normal range 3500 - 8500). KL-6 and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) were measured using the preserved blood 
serum (blood sample taken onelliMile before the subject started top receive crizotinib) and showed 826 U/mL 
and 29.2 ng/mL respectively; beta-D glucan could not be measured in the preserved blood serum. On 11.1111. 
the subject's PS (performance status) was 1. Therefore, the sub'ect started to receive crizotinib by the investigator's 
discretion based on the tests results. Delirium (grade 1) on occurred prior to the initiation of the study 
drug, so this was assessed as not related to crizotinib by the investigator. 
OnellEinthe subject consulted psychiatry department and was diagnosed as having delirium. The 
psychiatrist evaluated that the cause and causality of delirium were unknown. The subject started on the same day 
haloperidol (SERENACE) orally at 1.5 mg once daily for delirium. On UMW head computed tomography (CT) 
scan showed no brain metastases. Ong delirium became grade 3, and crizotinib was temporarily 
withdrawn due to the event from 01Jun2012 per protocol. The last dose of crizotinib was taken in the evening on 
31May2012. On 31May2012 haloperidol was switched from tablet to injection, 5 mg daily, since the oral formulation 
was not effective. On oxygen saturation was decreased (SpO2 was 88%), blood lactate 
dehydrogenase was 591 IU/L, RP was 9.10 mg/dl, and WBC was 10720/mm3. KL-6 value was 1064 Ili/mi. Based 
on the mild inflammation findings (CRP was 2.67 on 11111111111111and 9.1 on GM= and type of pyrexia, tumor 
associated fever was initially suspected. On =NM chest X-ray showed shadow of tumor in the right lower 
lobe and hilar area, and ground-glass opacity and infiltrative shadow in the right upper lung field and left middle-
lower lung field, chest CT (computer tomography) scan showed diffused/ geographical ground glass opacity in 
widespread area of both lung fields. No change was observed in enlargement of lymph nodes from the right hilum 
to bronchial bifurcation, but subcutaneous metastasis in the left anterior chest was slightly enlarged compared with 
CT findings on It was clarified that the subject had no pleural effusion. Based on the results, the 
investigator consi ere that this event was highly suspected of drug-induced pneumonitis rather than infectious 
pneumonia. 
The serious adverse events were reported as delirium with onset date land pneumonitis with onset date 
111111111. The investigator assessed the event delirium as serious because of hospitalization prolonged. The 
subject was hospitalized from to 11111111111 because his home was far from the site. 
The subject started to receive steroi pu se therapy on fill111111 On 41.111111 chest X-ray showed 
aggravation of round-glass opacity and infiltrative shadow in the right upper lung field and left middle-lower lun 
field. On delirium was slightly improved and the subject could do simple conversation. On

the subject died due to progression of drug-induced acute lung disorder. At the time of death the subject had not 
recovered from delirium. Autopsy was not performed because it was not agreed by the subject's family. No imaging 
procedure was performed on .1111.11111 Results of tumor markers from 11111111111111.to were not 
provided. Assessment for the disease under study was not conducted after MOM The investigations such as 
sputum culture, blood tests for beta-D-glucan or B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP), that were stipulated in the 
protocol, were scheduled on_ because they could not be performed onallIMI(Saturday) and 
1111111111111(Sunday). However, these investigations could not be performed eventually because the subject's 
condition was aggravated and priority was given to treatment for the event.

FOIA Case Report Information 
The investigator considered that there was a reasonable possibility that the event pneumonitis was related to 
crizotinib but not to a clinical trial procedure. The investigator reported that.a causal relationship between the event 
and haloperidol was unknown but it was not completely ruled out at the time of the report. The investigator's 
comment was as follows: the chest radiograph and CT scan showed diffused ground glass opacity in both lung 
fields. This appearance indicated drug induced lung injury. Recently the subject was started on haloperidol and 
crizotinib. Other drugs were used safely for a long time. It has been reported that acute lung injury was one of the 
critical adverse events in subjects treated with crizotinib. On the other hand, this adverse event was very rare with 
haloperidol administration. Therefore, the investigator believed that administration of crizotinib induced the lung 
injury to the subject despite crizotinib had been stopped before onset of the event. The reason of stopping was 
thought to be the subject's oxygen saturation level that had started dropping from Radiation 
pneumonitis was excluded because the subject had not received radiation therapy. 
The investigator considered that a causal relationship between the event delirium (grade 3) and crizotinib was 
unknown, but it could not be ruled out. Although delirium was slightly improved onalINIMP the investigator 
considered that the treatment with haloperidol (SERENACE) might have contributed to the improvement of delirium 
one and the investigator also considered that a causal relationship between delirium and pneumonitis or 
pyrexia could not be ruled out. The investigator considered that there was not a reasonable possibility that the 
event, delirium, was related to any clinical trial procedure or concomitant drugs. 
Both reported events were considered unrelated to past chemotherapy pemetrexed and carboplatin.
