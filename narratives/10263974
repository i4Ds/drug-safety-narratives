symptoms included memory disturbance for one month (presumed onse of May 2014). However, the patient had a 
history of cognitive deficits. For two days, the patient had diffuse mild cephalalgia in the right side of her head. MRI 
(unknown date) revealed multifocal T2 hyperintensities subcortical temporal on the right but also occipital and 
parietal, not involving the U-fibers. Lumbar puncture (LP) was done on 03 Jun 2014 and samples were sent to the 
(b) (6)  (results still pending). Patient had been on TYSABRI since 20 
Oct 2009.
Update 13 Jun 2014: The neurologist reported the patient had previously been on Copaxone (glatiramer acetate) 
for five months, until Feb 2009.  The patient had not received any immunosuppressive therapy.  Cerebrospinal fluid 
was collected on 03 Jun 2014 for JCV testing and the result was negative.  A sample has been sent to the 
university laboratory and the result is pending.  The patient is schedule for the next MRI on 23 Jun 2014.
Update 17 Jun 2014: The neurologist provided additional patient identifiers including initials and date of birth 
clarifying the patient to be 44 years old.
Update 18 Jun 2014: The neurologist stated that JCV PCR was weakly positive (NOS).
Update 26 Jun 2014: Additional Information was provided by the neurologist. The patient on TYSABRI (300 mg IV 
QM) for RRMS from March 2009 (date discrepant) to May 2014 was hospitalized from (b) (6)  to (b) (6)
for suspect PML (onset mid May 2014).   According to the neurologist, the patient has received a total of 50 
TYSABRI infusions and is not pregnant. Information from the discharge summary of the hospitalization from (b) (6)
(b) (6)  to (b) (6)  indicated that the patient's final diagnosis was natalizumab associated progressive multifocal 
leukoencephalopathy.  The patient had been diagnosed with MS in 2009 and patient's EDSS was 2.5.  Since May 
2014, the patient had increasing difficulties in concentration. For one week (approximately since 26 May 2014) the 
patient had been suffering from severe headaches which were treated with ibuprofen. Affective instability and 
changes in character had been observed too which triggered a cMRI scan. Result of cMRI (date of scan not 
reported) revealed extended T2 hyperintense lesions temporal and occipital on the right side as well as occipital on 
the left side, not involving the sulci. The lesions were not contrast enhancing. Control cMRI on (b) (6)  did not 
show any signs of IRIS. Mild hemisymptoms on the right, sensory ataxia, and cognitive deficits were noted on 
neurological examination.  Mainly the processing performance of visual information was impaired as well as 
cognitive-intellectual and executive functions.  Testing included JCV PCR in CSF (unknown dates), where the first 
test was negative (performed at local lab) and second test was positive with 30 copies (performed at the laboratory 
of the (b) (6) ), which confirmed PML.  Treatment included 5 cycles of immunoadsorption with an 
interval of 2 to 3 days between the sessions in order to avoid IRIS, mefloquine 250 mg QD from (b) (6)  to (b)(6)  
(b) (6)  and then once weekly, mirtazapine 30 mg QD from (b) (6)  to (b) (6)  and then 60 mg QD, and 
levetiracetam 1000 mg QD for prevention of seizure at first and then 500 mg QD since (b) (6)   The patient

was clinically stable and was discharged home on 24 Jun 2014.  Follow-up appointment was scheduled for 04 July 
2014.  The event resolved with sequelae (sequelae not specified).  The causality for the event in relation to 
TYSABRI was assessed as related.  TYSABRI therapy was permanently discontinued (discrepant information) in 
May 2014.
Update 03 Jul 2014: Upon internal review, this case is confirmed for PML based on positive CSF, MRI, and clinical 
evolution. MRI images from the following dates (30 May 2014, (b) (6)  and(b) (6) ) were provided and 
reviewed internally as consistent with multilobar non enhancing PML.
Update 07 Aug 2014: Additional information was received from a neurologist via a MS Standardized PML Data 
Collection Tool. The patient is alive (current location unspecified). On unspecified dates in 2009 and in 2013, the 
patient was tested for serum anti-JCV antibodies (results not reported). On 09 Jun 2013, the patient had a 
leukocyte count of 13.1. At the time of PML diagnosis, the patient s leukocyte count was 10.4. On 25 Jul 2014, the 
patient was tested for HIV (result not provided). The neurologist assessed the patient s estimated functional scores
as follows: 01 Jan 2009 Karnofsky score 80 (normal activity with effort; some signs or symptoms of disease), EDSS
3; 01 Mar 2014 Karnofsky score 90 (able to carry on normal activity; minor signs or symptoms of disease), EDSS 
1.5; and 01 Jun 2014 Karnofsky score 70 (cares for self; unable to carry on normal activity or to do active work), 
EDSS 2.5. The patient was diagnosed with IRIS (onset unknown), which was determined by clinical symptoms of 
cognitive decline (onset 21 Jul 2014), hemiparesis (onset 07 Aug 2014); speech (onset 07 Aug 2014), and 
hemianopsia (onset 25 Jul 2014). The patient received corticosteroids pre- and post-IRIS onset. 
Methylprednisolone 1000 mg daily was administered from 21 Jul to 25 Jul 2014.  Methylprednisolone 1000 mg was 
administered from 05 Aug 2014 with a planned stop date of 10 Aug 2014.  No additional lumbar punctures have 
been performed. The patient has not recovered from PML; causality of the event to TYSABRI was unknown. The 
outcome of the event of IRIS and causality to TYSABRI were not reported.
Update 22 Aug 2014: Additional information was received from the neurologist. The patient s HIV test on 25 Jul 
2014 was negative. Further laboratory test results were not available. IRIS was diagnosed based on clinical 
symptoms and MRI findings. Further MRIs performed on unspecified dates show significant worsening (not 
specified).
Update 23 Dec 2014: Additional information was received from a neurologist via a MS Standardized PML Data 
Collection Tool. The patient is alive, residing at home, and is currently on an unspecified medication for MS therapy.
The patient s estimated Karnofsky and EDSS scores on 23 Dec 2014 were 70 (cares for self; unable to carry on 
normal activity or to do active work) and 3. A brain MRI was performed on 03 Dec 2014 (awaiting results). 
Leukocyte count obtained on 03 Dec 2014 was 7.7. Treatment for IRIS included the following: methylprednisolone 
1000 mg IV daily from 21 Jul 2014 to 25 Jul 2014; methylprednisolone 1000 mg IV daily from 26 Aug 2014 to 30

Aug 2014; mirtazapine 60 mg PO, twice daily started 04 Jun 2014; Lariam (mefloquine) 250 mg weekly; 
levetiracetam 500 mg, twice daily; and Pantozol 40 mg, once daily. The neurologist also reported that the patient 
received five doses of methylprednisolone in Aug 2011. The patient has not recovered from PML and has 
recovered from IRIS. Causality of the event of IRIS was assessed as related to TYSABRI.
Update 23 Dec 2014: Follow-up information received indicated the patient was enrolled in the (b) (6)
 subject ID (b) (6)   The patient started TYSABRI on 26 May 2009.  The 
most recent infusion prior to the event was on 06 May 2014 and TYSABRI was permanently discontinued on 02 Jun
2014.  The serious criteria for the event of PML was reported as life-threatening, medically significant, and 
hospitalization ((b) (6)  to (b) (6) ).  The severity of the event of PML was assessed as moderate.  The 
patient was noted to be ambulatory.  The patient has not yet recovered.  The relationship of the study drug to the 
event of PML was assessed as related.
Update 29 Dec 2014: In response to a request for clarification, the neurologist reported that the patient currently 
does not receive therapy for MS. Since the manifestation of IRIS, the patient had received corticosteroids several 
times; currently, the patient receives only PML specific and antiepileptic medication. The neurologist confirmed that 
the patient has not recovered from PML, and confirmed that causality for the event of IRIS was assessed as related
to TYSABRI.
Update 29 Jun 2015: Additional information was received from a neurologist via a MS Standardized PML Data 
Collection Tool. The patient is alive, residing at home, and is not currently on medication for MS. The patient s 
estimated EDSS score was assessed on 13 May 2015 as 3.5 and Karnofsky score was assessed on 25 Jun 2015 
as 70 (cares for self; unable to carry on normal activity or to do active work).  The most recent brain MRI was 
performed on 18 Jun 2015 (awaiting results). The patient has not recovered from PML and IRIS. Causality of the 
events of PML and IRIS was assessed as related to TYSABRI.
