This special surveillance (H3E-JE-HS01, PliAS non-interventional) case, concerns a 61 year-old male. The patient's 
concurrent condition included metastases to bone and lymph node, pleural effusion, hypertension, hyperlipidaemia, 
reflux esophagitis, unspecified liver disorder, unspecified renal disorder, pathological Th12 thoracic vertebral 
fracture, esophageal. candida and diffuse gastritis. He did not previously receive any surgery or radiation therapy for 
non-small cell king cancer. He had no history of cardiac disease, pneumonia and chronic obstructive pulmonary 
disease (COIF). He received multiple concomitant medication including folic acid and vitramin B12. His baseline 
lab data,prier to pemetrexed administration  on was as follows: white blood cellcount (WBC) 8500trnm3, neutrophil 
count (Neut).6800/mrn3, platelet count (Plt) 25  609 ..nirn3, haemoglobin (lib) 9;6 gicIL, lymphocyte count (Lyrn) 
8501mtn3, 0 .a  a  urea nitrogen (BUN) 20 mgldL, blood creatinine (Cre) 1.57 mg/cit... His performance status (PS) 
prior to pemeirexed administration was 2. The patient received pemetrexed 500rng/m2 and carboplatin 400mg with 
supportivetreatmeet of dexamethan and azasetron as 1st tine therapy for lung ,a 7, :aat:cinorna stage IV on 22-
Jan,2010. On 24-Jan-2010, he complained of swallowing problem of water and food (reported as non-serious 
event). On 25-Jan-2010, aggravation of esophageal .  a.a.  was suspected, for whic hh e received miconazole as 
corrective treatment. His tab data was as fa  a  : WBC 91:00/mm3, Neut 8372/rnm3, Pit 32.;  e  44 Lyrn 
546trnrn3, Hb 9.1 gidL, BUN 16 mg/di_ and Cre 0.80 mgiciL. OnlIMINIIIMINFlays after the first dose of 
pemetrexed and carboiatin, he developed white aaaa  cell count decreased with WBC 7.001rnm3 (grade4), 
neutrophil count decreased with Neut 392/mm3 (grade4) and lymphocyte count decreased with Lyrn 259/mm3, 
which was  . ed as serious for hospitalization. He started filgrastim (until 04-Feb-2049) as corrective 
treatment. On he experienced bacterial pneumonia, which was serious for life threatening. He 
startederieropenern as corrective treatment for bacterial  "s. On his renal function

re :0 (000n failure in his left upper lung lobe, for which he received cefepime as corrective treatment. His lab data 
was as a  a  : WBC 1200/mm3, Neut 768/mm3, Lynn 336/mm3 Pit 92000/rnm3, BUN 33 mgidi and Cre 1.29 
L. On 02-Feb-2010, he received  a  a     :  and tazobactam_piperacillin for the bacterial pneumonia. On 
he experienced platelet count decreased with 3 -  a r  mm3 (reported as non-serious). He recovered from the 
white a aaa cell count decreased, neutrophil count decreased, and lymphocyte decreased with WBC 4200/mm3, 
Neut 3612/mm3 and Lyrn 420/mm3. His respiratory condition due to bacterial pneumonia  a    vated with increase 
of pleural effusion, for which he receivced central vein catheter, pleural indwelling drain and platelet transfusion. On 
his platelet count was increased to 65000/mm3 because of platelet transfusion. General condition

and.h.ydrocortisone, He had a sedative effect, so his respiratory condition was improving. On

the white blood cell count decreased, neutrophil count decreased and lymphocyte decreased were related to 
pemetrexed, carboplatin and metastases to spine. The investigator stated that the pontine infarction was not related 
to parnetrexed and related to coagulation disorder due to cancer. The investigator the bacterial pneumonia, renal 
function aggravated were not related to pemetrexed. The investigator believed that the ARDS was not related to 
pemetrexed arid induced by bacterial pneumonia. Updated on 09-Apr-2010: additional information was received on 
06,Apr-2010 from the investigator. Added event of lymphocyte decreased and renal function aggravated, tab data, 
concomitant drug in.  . 9 - and investigator's comment. Updated event detailed information. Changed serious 
criteria of.bacleriat.pneumonia and ARDS tolife threatening. Changed event outcome of white blood cell decreased 
and neuthaphil count decreaded to recovered. Deleted event of haemoglobin decreased. Updated narrative and
