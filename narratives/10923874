Medically Significant
A registered nurse spontaneously reported that a 37 year old male patient on TYSABRI (300 mg, IV, QM) for 
Multiple Sclerosis from 01 Oct 2007 to 13 Oct 2014 experienced suspect PML (onset Feb 2015).  The patient was 
diagnosed with MS 15 years ago (presumed 2000). Prior therapies included Rebif (interferon beta 1a) until 2005. 
The patient also participated in an interleukin trial (NOS) until 10 Oct 2006. The patient had not used prior 
immunosuppressant therapy. Past medical history included epilepsy diagnosed in Mar 2005. Concomitant 
medications included fingolimod, Vitamin D supplement, Lamectal (lamotrigine) - brand and generic, pantoprazol, 
and tamsulosine. The patient initiated TYSABRI therapy on 01 Oct 2007 and discontinued therapy on 13 Oct 2014. 
JCV Status on 24 Sep 2014 was positive, with an index of 3.72. An MRI on 04 Aug 2014 was normal. On 18 Nov 
2014 the patient started therapy with fingolimod. No MRI was performed during the washout period of TYSABRI 
prior to starting fingolimod therapy. On 10 Feb 2015, an MRI showed new vague lesion dorsal in right frontal lobe, 
suspicious of PML. It was recommended to repeat the MRI 2 weeks later. An MRI on 27 Feb 2015 showed clear 
progression of lesion dorsal in right frontal lobe. No T1 low signal and MRIs were checked by (b) (6)  Centre, 
(b) (6) , and confirmed for PML. LP samples (date unknown) are to be shipped locally for testing (NOS). At the 
time of this report, the patient had no clinical symptoms. Treatment for the event was not provided. The event of 
suspect PML is ongoing. Causality for the event is unknown.  TYSABRI therapy was discontinued on 13 Oct 2014.
Update 04 Mar 2015: Upon follow-up, a physician reported that the event is "more probable related to TYSABRI 
than fingolimod," though noted that he would report the event to the other manufacturer as well.
Update 06 Mar 2015: Additional information was received spontaneously from the registered nurse. The JCV DNA 
(local) test (date unknown) was negative (presume reference to previous lumbar puncture). On 04 Mar 2015 the 
patient was seen by the nurse and was doing well. On 05 Mar 2015 an MRI was performed and the results were 
pending at the time of this report.
Update 10 Mar 2015: Upon follow-up, the registered nurse reported that the patient is being treated with mefloquine
250 mg and mirtazapine 30 mg, both once daily. The MRI on 05 Mar 2015 was "stable," with a second opinion 
provided by (b) (6)  The patient had a seizure (onset unknown). Past medical history included epilepsy. The patient 
visited the ER because of the seizure on (b) (6)  Testing and treatment for the seizure were not provided, and
the event has resolved. The healthcare professional assessed the seizure as being related to mefloquine (presume 
unrelated to TYSABRI).
Update 10 Mar 2015: The registered nurse provided MRI images via a Biogen Idec representative for the following 
dates: 02 Jul 2013 (corresponding report not provided), 11 Oct 2013, 13 Jan 2014, 24 Apr 2014, 04 Aug 2014, 21 
Oct 2014 (corresponding report not provided), 10 Feb 2015, 27 Feb 2015, and 05 Mar 2015. A study from 20 Mar

Update 10 Mar 2015: Additional information was received from the registered nurse, which included a completed 
suspect PML Data Collection Tool (DCT), a report of blood samples from 10 Nov 2014, 17 Dec 2014, 24 Feb 2015,
and 03 Mar 2015, a local liquor assessment from 03 Mar 2015, local radiology reports as well as second opinion 
reports from (b) (6) . The nurse indicated that the patient was diagnosed with MS in 1993 at the age of 15 
(discrepant information). Suspect products were TYSABRI and fingolimod. The patient discontinued fingolimod on 
03 Mar 2015. It was noted that the patient did not experience an interruption of the suspect products for greater 
than 3 months. The patient had not received any prior immunosuppressant therapy. Prior immunomodulatory 
therapy included Rebif (interferon beta 1a) until 2005. The patient was also in an interleukin trial (received placebo 
arm) from 2004/5 to Sep 2006. The reason the patient was being evaluated for PML was due to a routine MRI that 
revealed suspicious findings. The nurse stated that the patient was asymptomatic. 
An MRI report from on 20 Mar 2013, ((b) (6) ) showed: image in agreement with MS without active demyelinisation, 
such as contrast-enhancing lesions. No sign of comorbidities or opportunistic infections. MRI reports from 11 Oct 
2013, 13 Jan 2014, 24 Apr 2014 and 04 Aug 2014 ((b) (6) ) all showed: stable MS. No signs of opportunistic 
infection such as PML. A local report for the 04 Aug 2014 MRI showed: Aspect is unchanged compared with 24 Apr
2014 and 13 Jan 2014. Known very wide symmetrical ventricles with abundant white matter lesions. Also white 
matter lesions cerebellar and right-sided in pons (pons varoli in latin). These are unchanged in amount and size. 
Also DWI shows no reduced diffusion. Conclusion: No evident increase of demyelinisation. No sign of PML. A local 
report of the 10 Feb 2015 MRI showed: Increased widening of the symmetrical ventricles, with clear increased 
signal intensity around the ventricles and multiple focal white matter lesions reaching up to peripheral (high 
frontoparietal right-sided) in comparison with 04 Aug 2014 image is comparable. A new lesion seems present 
dorsolateral in right frontal lobe. (Axial on Flair IMA 10 and 11) with unclear subcortical localization. Lesion shows 
no reduced diffusion. Other lesions seem already present; some differences might be due to different coupe-level. 
Conclusion: reduced protocol. In comparison to 04 Aug 2014 a new unclear peripheral localized lesion dorsally in 
right-sided frontal lobe. Findings might fit new MS activity, but also might fit PML. Please repeat MRI in 2 weeks 
with additional T1W pre and post contrast. A (b) (6)  report on the 10 Feb 2015 MRI indicated: As compared to the 
previous scans of 04 Aug 2014. Unchanged aspect of the ventricles and the peripheral liquor space with clear 
separation of grey and white matter. There is a new lesion fronto insular right-sided. This lesion has PML features. 
This lesion shows partially high signal-intensity on the DWI. Subtle swelling of the right insula. No clear sign of 
contralateral PML manifestation. No sign of recurrent MS activity. Conclusion: Image in line with PML right fronto 
insular. A local report of the 27 Feb 2015 MRI showed: Known cerebral atrophy and extensive white matter lesions. 
Right dorsofrontal a slightly increased puntiform (cystic) aspect is seen. The diffuse distortions seem slightly 
increased since the 10 Feb 2015 imaging. The images after contrast show no lower signal intensity in this region. 
Conclusion: With this patient with extensive lesion load and atrophy there is a progression of the lesions

dorsofrontal on the right frontal lobe. This is clearly enlarged since the imaging of 04 Aug 2014 and discretely 
enlarged since 10 Feb 2015. The lack of low signal on the T1W and the enhancement speak against PML, on the 
other hand an IRIS (rebound) after TYSABRI should be considered. A (b) (6)  report on the 27 Feb 2015 MRI 
showed: Unchanged aspect of the ventricles and the peripheral liquorspace with clear separation of grey and white 
matter. The known diffuse lesion fronto insular with extension in the basal core, where the lesions shows some 
micro-cystes. There is a subtle focal swelling of the right insula.  These lesions show partially high signal-intensity 
on the DWI. After enhancement multiple small focal lesions are seen, in the edges of this lesion. Conclusion: Image
in line with PML with signs of PML-IRIS. A local report for the (b) (6)  MRI showed: The findings are 
unchanged since 27 Feb 2015 including the aspecific and diffuse contrastcaptation in the right hemisphere, at 
specifically the operculum.
On 24 Sep 2014, the patient tested positive for serum anti-JCV antibodies (index 3.72). A lumbar puncture was 
performed on (b) (6)  and samples were sent to two local labs for testing. Both lab samples tested negative 
(not detected) for CSF JCV DNA. A brain biopsy was not performed. Laboratory testing on 10 Nov 2014 included:

FOIA Case Report Information
Update 16 Mar 2015: The registered nurse re-reported via a Biogen Idec representative that both CSF samples 
(sent to two local labs) were negative. And, since the patient was already in IRIS phase, the neurologist did not 
think another lumbar puncture would be helpful, noting that the lesion was too small. The patient had a CSF index 
of anti-JCV antibody of 4.7 (presume (b) (6) ). The nurse stated that the serum index was also high, around 3-
something (presume reference to previous serum index of 3.72).
Update 25 Mar 2015: Additional information received from the registered nurse reported that the male patient 
started a MP (presume methylprednisolone) course for 3 days at 1000 mg per day. "Last (b) (6)  (presume (b)(6)  
) the patient informed the site that his coordination of walking was decreasing. Based on the increased 
complaints, the doctor started MP course in the hospital. An MRI on (b) (6)  was stable, with no increase of 
the present lesions, no increase in edema, and no new lesions.
Update 16 Apr 2015: Upon internal review, Biogen considers this case to be final call for high suspect PML. This 
case will be closed and no additional follow-up is expected.
Update 11 May 2015: The prescribing / treating neurologist spontaneously reported via a Biogen representative that
the patient was deteriorating, with cognitive worsening and behavioral changes. Furthermore, strength and 
coordination in both legs was decreased, which was diagnosed as spinal cord related (onset unknown). To be 
certain, a lumbar puncture was done (date unknown; presume for CSF JCV DNA testing) and an MRI will be 
repeated. The outcome for the event of spinal cord related decrease in strength and coordination in both legs was 
unknown. Causality for the event of spinal cord related decrease in strength and coordination in both legs was not 
assessed.
