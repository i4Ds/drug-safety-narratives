Medically Significant
A neurologist spontaneously reported that a 29 year old female patient on TYSABRI (300 mg, IV, QM) for RRMS, 
diagnosed in Apr 2011, from Mar 2012 to 25 Aug 2014 experienced PML (onset Dec 2014). No relevant history was
reported. Concomitant medication included vitamin B. Tysabri treatment had been discontinued due to JCV 
antibody index high (result not provided). In Dec 2014 the patient presented disarthria and paresia of the right arm. 
Initially a MS relapse was suspected. An MRI was taken in Dec2014 and showed lesion in the left thalamus, 
compatible with Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy. A positive PCR for JC virus was detected from her 
CSF was obtained and PML was confirmed. Seven courses of plasmapheresis were performed, and treatment with
Mefloquine (250 mg/day for the first 3 days, and 150 mg/week) and Mirtazapine (45 mg/day) was started. With this 
treatment, disarthria and paresia of the right arm improved. Her last EDSS status (26Jan2015) was reported to be 
The outcome for the event PML is unknown. The causality for the event of PML is unknown.  TYSABRI therapy was
discontinued in August 2014.

FOIA Case Report Information
Update 02 Jun 2015: Additional information was received from the neurologist via a Standardized PML Data 
Collection Tool. The patient is currently at home.  The patient's height was 170 cm and weight was 61 kg. Lumbar 
punctures were done on 11 Apr 2011 (result not reported) and 09 Jan 2015 (result positive for >10 copies / mL 
[JCV DNA]).  MRI prior to PML diagnosis was on 06 Jun 2014 (results not provided).  MRI at the time of PML 
diagnosis was performed on 05 Jan 2015 (results not provided).  Additional tests include anti-JCV [antibody] status 
positive (index values 2.24) in Aug 2014, leukocyte count before PML diagnosis 5400 (4-10.5) on 01 Oct 2014, 
lymphocyte count before PML diagnosis 18%, absolute lymphocyte count before PML diagnosis 972, leucocyte 
count at the time of PML diagnosis (05 Jan 2015) 8750, lymphocyte count at the time of PML diagnosis 22%, 
absolute lymphocyte count at the time of PML diagnosis 1925, CD4 at the time of PML diagnosis 284, HIV results 
negative. The patient was not tested for anti-natalizumab antibodies. Estimated Karnofsky and EDSS scores before
starting product in Oct 2014 was100 (normal no complaints; no evidence of disease) and 0.  Estimated Karnofsky 
and EDSS scores in Jan 2015, at the time of PML diagnosis, were 70 (cares for self; unable to carry on normal 
activity or to do active work) and 3.5.  The patient recovered from PML and has not been diagnosed with IRIS.
Update 11 Jun 2015: Biogen considers this case confirmed for PML based on positive CSF, consistent radiological 
findings, and clinical symptoms.
Update 28 Oct 2015: Additional information was received from the neurologist via a MS Standardized PML Data 
Collection Tool.  The patient was alive and living at home.  Current MS therapy included rituximab since Mar 2015 
due to radiological evidence of return of Multiple Sclerosis. Most recent brain MRI was performed in Mar 2015 
(results not provided). The patients Karnofsky and EDSS scores assessed on 06 Aug 2015 100 and 2.0, 
respectively. Test results from 21 Aug 2015 included leukocyte count 8710 (range 4.5-11.3), lymphocyte count 1.71
(range 0.9-4.52), absolute lymphocyte count 1707 (reference range not provided), CD4 790 (range 404-1612), CD8
590 (range 220-1129), CD4/CD8 ratio 1.34 (range 0.8-4.2), and CD19+ 0.16 (range 5-22). The patient has not been
diagnosed with IRIS. As of 06 Aug 2015, the patient recovered from PML. Causality for the event of PML was 
assessed by the physician as related to TYSABRI.
