This spontaneous report was received from a physician via Compassionate Use Study source and concerns a 9-
year-old Caucasian female patient from the United States; local case identification number: 2015430797.
The patient's weight was 32.9 kilograms and height was 141 centimeters. The patient's concurrent condition 
included acute myeloid leukemia recurrent beginning on 06-OCT-2015 (post-transplant studies showed 5% blasts) 
and medical history included acute lymphoblastic leukemia between 07-JUN-2011 and OCT-2013 (pre-B white 
blood cells (WBC) 60000, coagulase-negative Staphylococcus (CNS) negative, treated on high risk protocol 
AALL0232, completed radiotherapy on OCT-2013), acute myeloid leukaemia beginning on (b) (6)  (went to 
hospital for matched sibling bone marrow plus umbilical cord transplant on (b) (6)  which was donated from a
matched sibling), also had grade 1 anemia and grade 1 platelet count decreased prior to start of treatment. The 
patient was treated with non-company suspect drug propofol (unspecified, unspecified) 100 mg as necessary at 
13:05, 250 ug/kg/min 13:06, 275 ug/kg/min at 13:31, 20 mg at 13:45, 10 mg at 13:47, 200 ug/kg/min at 14:04 and 
stopped at 14:13 administered for anesthesia. The patient was pre-medicated for gemtuzumab ozogamicin with 
paracetamol at 480 mg every 6 hours for moderate pain, methylprednisolone sodium succinate and hydroxyzine 
hydrochloride. The patient was treated with company suspect decitabine (lyophilized powder, intravenous) 22.8 mg 
a cyclical, (every 24 hours for 5 doses), initiated on 23-OCT-2015, along with gemtuzumab ozogamicin (injection, 
intravenous not otherwise specified (NOS)) 3.42 mg administered on 27-OCT-2015 both for acute myeloid 
leukaemia recurrent. Concomitant medications included cytarabine for acute myeloid leukaemia, morphine for pain,
cefazolin sodium for central venous catheterization, allopurinol, sulfamethoxazole, trimethoprim for pneumocystis 
carinii prophylaxis, ondansetron for nausea and vomiting, heparin for prophylaxis, bupivacaine for pain, ceftriaxone 
sodium for fever, bupivacaine hydrochloride for pain, fentanyl for pain, paracetamol for pain, and allopurinol for 
acute myeloid leukaemia. The decitabine was administered till 27-OCT-2015. On (b) (6)  after the infusion, 
she got fever a few hours. The patient had a temperature of 38.8 degrees C at 18:00. The patient was admitted to 
the hospital. She was given paracetamol 32.5 mg tablet orally, every 4 hours for 3 doses for fever with a 
temperature of 38.2 degrees C at 23:42. The patient also received another dose of paracetamol 498 mg liquid, oral 
once at 23:42. Blood cultures were drawn (central line and peripheral, no growth was seen to date), and she was 
started on empiric antibiotics. The patient received Vancocin (vancomycin) for fever 500 mg intravenous piggyback 
(IVPB) mini-bag intravenous every 6 hours and Fortaz (ceftazidime) for febrile neutropenia 2 g IVPB mini-bag 
intravenous every 8 hours. The patient was diagnosed with grade 1 fever requiring patient's

hospitalization/prolongation of hospitalization. The patient was treated with another company drug DIFLUCAN 
(fluconazole) (film coated tablet, oral) 200 mg a day, initiated on 28-OCT-2015 for antifungal prophylaxis. The 
vancomycin was administered till 28-OCT-2015 and ceftazidime till 29-OCT-2015. The patient recovered 
completely from grade 1 fever on (b) (6)  The patient was discharged on the same day 48 hours after the 
hospitalization, when blood cultures showed no growth to date. The patient experienced grade 4 neutrophil count 
decrease on the same day when complete blood count (CBC) revealed absolute neutrophil count (ANC) of 0.3 x 
10e3/mm3 (NR: 1.0 - 9.0 x 10e3/mm3). On 30-OCT-2015, the ANC was 0.5 x 10e3/mm3 (grade 3 neutrophil count 
decreased). On the same day, the patient experienced grade 1 alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level increased with
ALT of 38 U/L (NR: 0-34 U/L). On 02-NOV-2015, at clinic visit, comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP) revealed 
ALT level of 26 U/L. The grade 3 neutrophil count decreased continued (neutrophil count was 0.1 x 10e3/mm3), 
which lead to grade 4 neutrophil count decreased. A clinic visit on same day revealed grade 2 platelet count 
decrease with platelet count of 54 x 10e3/mm3 (NR: 165 - 335 x 10e3/mm3). On (b) (6)  the platelet count 
was 40 x 10e3/mm3 (grade 3 platelet count decrease). The patient experienced grade 3 febrile neutropenia which 
required hospitalization /prolongation of hospitalization. She was treated with another non-company suspect drug 
immunoglobulin human normal (injection, intravenous NOS) unspecified dose and frequency initiated on 04-NOV-
2015 for decreased immunoglobulin G (IGG). She took acetaminophen IVIG 480 mg liquid oral once-prior to IVIG 
and aydroxyzine for IVIG 20 mg tablet oral once-prior to IVIG for pre-medication. At clinic visit, the ANC was 0. The 
patient that evening had a temperature of 101.7 Fahrenheit at home and was presented to emergency department 
(ED). On (b) (6)  the patient had also experienced grade 1 rectal pain. The physical examination of 
perirectal area was notable for being reddish, but no point tenderness. The physical examinations were not 
consistent with a perirectal abscess. The patient started on zinc oxide 40 % ointment topical two times daily as 
necessary. On the same day, she was febrile to 40.9 C in ED, ANC equal to 0, blood cultures were obtained 
(central line and peripheral), and was started on ceftazidime intravenous for febrile neutropenia at 1000 mg IVBP 
(intravenous Mini bag) every 8 hours, and at a dose of 1600 mg IVBP, intravenous every 8 hours. The drug was 
ongoing as of the report. The patient was admitted to hospital for further monitoring and continued antibiotic therapy
in setting off fever and neutropenia. On(b) (6)  the patient experienced grade 2 anemia, hemoglobin was 8 
g/dL (NR: 11.2 - 14.8 g/dL). She had received red blood cell transfusion of 310 mL in total volume. The patient also 
received paracetamol tablet, oral 325 mg once for fever, ondansetron hydrochloride injection, intravenous 2 mg 
every 6 hours, as needed for nausea or vomiting on 06-NOV-2015 and 07-NOV-2015. The ondansetron 
hydrochloride intravenous 4 mg was administered every 6 hours as necessary from 07-NOV-2015. On 09-NOV-
2015, she experienced grade 1 constipation and was treated with Colace (docusate sodium) capsule, oral 50mg 
daily. Treatment for the patient ended with a bone marrow biopsy that determined that the treatment was 
unsuccessful, and gemtuzumab ozogamicin did not work. The patient received propofol 1 mg/kg injection every 1 
min as necessary, total dose of 100 mg and was treated with company suspect SUBLIMAZE (fentanyl) (injection, 
intravenous NOS) 15 ug a as necessary, (once per 1 min, received total dose of 30 ug), administered on 09-NOV-
2015 for sedation. During procedural sedation, the patient experienced grade 3 hypotension, mild drop to 60/20s

and required a fluid bolus. The patient received 310 mL of sodium chloride 0.9%. After the procedure patient was 
awake, alert and talking. She recovered on the same date from grade 3 hypotension. The ondansetron 
hydrochloride 4 mg was administered till 10-NOV-2015. She had a bowel movement on 10-NOV-2015. The patient 
was changed to Senna-plus (senna-docusate) 8.5-50mg tablet once nightly. The treatment with zinc oxide was 
stopped on the same day and the patient had recovered from rectal pain on the same day. The grade 3 platelet 
count decreased (52 x 10e3/mm3) continued until 12-NOV-2015, which resulted in grade 2 platelet count. Blood 
cultures showed no growth, and the patient received ceftazidime until 12-NOV-2015. She was afebrile for a period 
of 8 days (since admission). The patient had recovered completely from the event febrile neutropenia and grade 1 
constipation on the same day and was discharged. At clinic visit on 16-NOV-2015, the patient reported grade 1 
bone pain in her upper thighs. Also, the platelet count was 121 x 10e3/mm3, the patient showed grade 1 platelet 
count decreased and the hemoglobin was 11.4g/dL. The patient did not require any platelet transfusions, no 
additional treatment given. The patient had recovered from platelet count decreased, grade 2 anemia on the same 
day and the patient was recovering from grade 4 neutrophil count decreased. On 20-NOV-2015, the ANC was 0.8 x
10e3/mm3 (grade 3 neutrophil count decreased-30 days after the last dose of gemtuzumab ozogamicin). On 20-
NOV-2015, the patient was started on oral palliative chemotherapy. At clinic visit on 23-NOV-2015, the ANC was 
0.9 x 10e3/mm3 (grade 3 neutrophil count decreased) and the bone pain resolved. The dose of fluconazole, 
fentanyl and propofol was not changed and action taken with decitabine, gemtuzumab ozogamicin and 
immunoglobulin human normal was not applicable. The patient was recovering from neutrophil count decreased 
and had recovered from grade 1 fever, grade 1 alanine aminotransferase increased, hypotension grade 3, grade 1 
rectal pain, grade 3 febrile neutropenia, grade 1 constipation, platelet count decreased, grade 2 anemia and grade 
1 bone pain. The investigator considered grade 3 febrile neutropenia related but specified as unlikely attributed to 
gemtuzumab ozogamicin, and possibly attributed to decitabine and to immunoglobulin human normal. The 
investigator considered there was a reasonable possibility that event grade 1 fever after infusion, grade 1 bone 
pain, grade 1 constipation, grade 2 anemia, grade 1 alanine aminotransferase increased, platelet count decreased, 
neutrophil count decreased and grade 1 rectal pain was related to gemtuzumab ozogamicin. The investigator 
assessed there was a possible attribution for the adverse event alanine aminotransferase increased to fluconazole 
and decitabine. The investigator also assessed  grade 1 constipation, grade 1 and grade 2 anemia, platelet count 
decreased, neutrophil count decreased, grade 1 bone pain, grade 1 rectal pain as possibly attributed to decitabine. 
Intravenous immune globulin was considered possibly attributed to anemia, neutrophil count decreased and platelet
count decreased. The investigator considered there was not a reasonable possibility that the event grade 3 
hypotension was related to gemtuzumab ozogamicin, and definite attributed the event to sedation medications 
propofol, and fentanyl.
This report was serious (hospitalization, medically significant).
