Medically Significant
A neurologist reported that a 56 year old male patient on TYSABRI (300 mg, IV, QM) for Multiple Sclerosis from 24 
Jun 2013 to 05 Aug 2015 and enrolled in a Biogen sponsored program of monitored therapy came under suspicion 
for progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) (onset unknown). The patient was diagnosed with MS in 
2008 after developing left optic neuritis.  Past medical history included a right hip replacement. Concomitant 
medications included AMPYRA, sertraline, tizanidine, baclofen, and Valium (diazepam). About one year after 
diagnosis he began having slowly progressive right-sided weakness but he denies any other clinical relapses. Prior 
MS therapies included Rebif (interferon beta-1a; from 2008 to 2010) and Copaxone (glatiramer acetate from May 
2011 to an unknown date). Both previous MS therapies were discontinued due to breakthrough disease on MRI. 
After starting TYSABRI therapy the patient's symptoms stabilized. Six months ago the patient began having 
headaches, cognitive slowing, word finding difficulty, imbalance requiring use of a cane, and 3-4 weeks ago, began 
experiencing right-sided headache lasting a day (relieved with ibuprofen), increased fatigue, bladder and bowel 
urgency and incontinence, and increase in dizziness. On an unspecified date the patient began feeling some fatigue
and dizziness. The patient began receiving TYSABRI every 6 weeks in Apr 2015.  The patient is not enrolled in 
STRATIFY. The patient tested positive for anti-JCV antibodies on unknown dates with index values of 2.7 and 2.1. 
An MRI from May 2015 was "stable". An MRI on 31 Aug 2015 showed a new subcortical right frontal lesion 
extending under the cortical surface of several gyri, new compared to May 2015 (which was stable), lesion typical of
PML. A review of systems (on an unspecified date) included the following symptoms: cognitive slowing, word 
finding difficulty, mild dysarthria, hand paresthesias, urine and bowel urgency / incontinence, left eye loss of color 
vision, R>L leg weakness and spasticity, spasms impaired balance (3-4 falls per week), and gait (able to walk 1 
mile without cane with right walk-aid). The patient was seen on 03 Sep 2015, not hospitalized, and underwent 
lumbar puncture (LP) for CSF sample to be sent to (b) (6)  for JCV DNA testing. Result was positive for JCV DNA per 
the (b) (6)  at 48 copies/mL; the sample was also sent to(b) (6)  and results were pending at the time of 
this report. At the time of this report, no treatment had been administered, however planned treatment included 
IVIG and cidofavir. The neurologist was not planning on plasma exchange (PLEX). The outcome for the event 
suspected PML is unknown. The causality for the event suspected PML is unknown. At the time of this report, the 
TOUCH database indicated that the patient had received a total of 25 infusions of TYSABRI from 24 Jun 2013 to 05
Aug 2015; TOUCH dosing history corroborates every 6 week dosing from 01 Apr 2015 to 05 Aug 2015. It is 
unknown if TYSABRI treatment is ongoing.
Update 14 Sep 2015:  The following additional anti-JCV antibody test results were received from a health care 
professional from the patient's MS center:  03 Jun 2013 positive, 30 Sep 2013 positive with an index value of 2.37, 
06 Jan 2014 positive with an index value of 2.46, 28 Oct 2014 positive with an index value of 2.51, and 26 May 
2015 positive with an index value of 2.14.

FOIA Case Report Information
Update 16 Sep 2015:  The patient's neurologist provided the following additional information.  The patient's CSF 
was negative for JCV DNA per(b) (6)   The neurologist's office confirmed that the CSF sample sent 
to(b) (6)  was from the same lumbar puncture on 03 Sep 2015 that was sent to the(b) (6)  labs.  A brain 
MRI from 04 Sep 2015 showed numerous T2 hyperintense white matter lesions in a distribution consistent with 
clinical diagnosis of MS, multiple right-sided T2 hyperintense lesions developed between 09 Apr and 31 Aug were 
unchanged, no abnormal enhancement noted, and a thinning of the corpus callosum and multiple T1 hypointense 
black holes were unchanged, the lateral ventricles were normal in size.  A cervical MRI from 04 Sep 2015 showed 
multiple cervical nonenhancing T2 hyperintense intramedullary lesions consistent with multiple sclerosis plaques 
and moderate cervical spondylosis without cord compression, bilateral foraminal stenosis at C506 and C6-7.
Update 17 Sep 2015:  Biogen considers this case to be confirmed for PML based on positive CSF, radiological 
evidence, and clinical symptoms.
