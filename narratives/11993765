Case number# PHHY2015CH159564, is a report initially received from a physician via a patient oriented program 
(b) (6)  POP20151349) on 02 Dec 2015. This report refers to an 8-year-old female patient. 
Historical history was not reported. Concurrent condition included cholelithiasis. The patient had blood transfusion 
(date unspecified). Concomitant medication included analgesics like NSAIDS (non steroidal anti inflammatory 
drugs), paracetamol. The patient received Exjade (deferasirox) dispersible tablet for the treatment of homozygous 
beta thalassemia (beta thalassemia) from 18 Aug 2010 at a dose of 250 mg, per day (QD), (route: unknown). In 
Jun 2012, the patient temporarily discontinued Exjade. The patient received Desferal (deferoxamine) subcutaneous
for an unknown indication at an unknown dose and frequency from Aug 2012. The patient also received Ferriprox 
(deferiprone) for an unknown indication at an unknown dose and frequency from an unknown date with continued 
ferritin values greater than 1000 ug/L under 500 mg/d (normal range not given). On 30 Sep 2014, the patient again 
started Exjade 500 mg per day. In Aug 2015, the patient had severe repeated, wave like, spasmodic abdominal 
pain which not diminished even after the fever abated, suspected tubulopathy (renal tubular disorder) and 
increased liver values/highly evaluated liver values (hepatic enzyme increased). From 11 May 2015 to 17 Nov 2015 
the dose of Exjade was increased to 1000 mg per day. At the end of Sep 2015, the patient had viral gastrointestinal
infection (gastrointestinal infection) which included coughing (cough), sniffling (rhinorrhoea), diarrhoea, intermittent 
nausea (nausea), vomiting and sub febrility (body temperature increased). In Sep 2015, the patient had renal 
fanconi syndrome (fanconi syndrome acquired). On 22 Sep 2015, the ALAT (alanine aminotransferase) (normal 
range less than 35 U/I) was 39 U/I. On 13 Oct 2015, ALAT was 60 U/I. On 03 Nov 2015, ALAT was 187 U/I. Since 
the beginning of Nov 2015, the patient also experienced weight bearing related muscle pain in both legs (lower leg 
and upper leg on both sides) (pain in extremity) which partial improve under oral phosphate substitution. On 17 Nov
2015, the patient discontinued Exjade with laboratory tests which included dyselectrolytaemia (electrolyte 
imbalance) with minimum values (normal range not provided): potassium 2.9 mmol/L, calcium 2.01 mmol/L 
(corrected), phosphate 0.3 mmol/L. Abdominal ultrasound did on 12 Nov 2015 which revealed preexisting 
cholelithiasis without cholecystitis, spleen size in the upper normal range, otherwise normal. On 19 Nov 2015, 
abdominal ultrasound did which revealed preexisting cholelithiasis without cholecystitis, decreasing spleen size, 
findings consistent with gastroenteritis, otherwise normal. On 19 Nov 2015, ALAT was 660 U/I, gamma GT (gamma
glutamyl transpeptidase) (normal range: less than 45 U/I) was 79 U/I, also the patient coagulation test did on 19 
Nov 2015 revealed quick 49 percentage (normal range: 70 to 100 percentage), On 19 Nov 2015, the patient 
serology and PCR testing for Hepatitis A, B, C and E virus: HAV, HBV, HCV, HIV screening was negative. On 21 
Nov 2015, ALAT was 333 U/I. On 24 Nov 2015, ALAT was 139 U/I and gamma GT was 61 U/I. On 14 Dec 2015, 
ALAT was 27 U/I and gamma GT was 32 U/I. On an unknown date, the patient had proteinuria, glucosuria 
(glycosuria), hypokalemia (hypokalaemia), hypocalcemia (hypocalcaemia), hypophosphatemia 
(hypophosphataemia), fatigue and myalgia. On an unknown date, calcium was 2.01 mmol/l (normal range not 
reported), fibrinogen was 1.2 g/l (normal range: 2 to 5), phosphate was 0.3 mmol/l (normal range not reported), 
potassium was 2.9 mmol/l (normal range not reported) and PPT (prothrombin time) was 43 sec (normal range: 25 
to 38 sec). On an unknown date, the patient did various laboratory tests which results unspecified like creatinine

clearance, a blood urea nitrogen (BUN), serum creatinine, hemoglobin, urinalysis, liver function tests, 24 hour 
protein (proteinuria), albumin, electrolytes, glomerular filtration rate, blood pressure, c reactive protein, coagulation 
studies, and renal ultrasound. Again Exjade re started on 25 Nov 2015, at a dose of 500 mg per day. The patient 
Exjade dose increased to 750 mg/day from 16 Dec 2015. The patient was hospitalized for the abdominal pain. The 
physician reported that, only liver values were increased which was not unexpected. On an unknown date, the 
patient recovered from the event hepatic enzyme increased. Action taken with Exjade was treatment temporarily 
interrupted. The outcome for event hepatic enzyme increased was reported as complete recovery, for event leg 
pain was condition improving, for event renal fanconi syndrome as condition unchanged. The outcome of other 
events was not reported. The seriousness of the events was not reported. Seriousness assessment of the event 
renal fanconi syndrome (fanconi syndrome acquired) was upgraded based on NVS IME list. Seriousness 
assessment of the event viral gastrointestinal infection was upgraded serious (medically significant) based on 
information available in source document. The causality of the events (dyselectrolytaemia, proteinuria, glucosuria, 
fanconi syndrome acquired, viral gastrointestinal infections) was reported as probable and not reported for rest of 
events.
Follow up report received from the physician on 30 Dec 2015: Updated outcome of the event (hepatic enzyme 
increased to complete recovery) and narrative (only liver values were increased, which was not unexpected).
Follow up report received from a physician on 19 Jan 2016: Added events (except hepatic enzyme increased, renal 
tubular disorder and abdominal pain), various laboratory data, co suspect (Desferal, Ferriprox). Updated event 
verbatim (abdominal pain), suspect details (action taken, dose) and updated narration.
Following an internal review done on 01 Jun 2016 for the data received on 19 Jan 2016, a significant correction was
performed. Changed the event coding of the event renal fanconi's syndrome from Fanconi syndrome to Fanconi 
syndrome acquired.
