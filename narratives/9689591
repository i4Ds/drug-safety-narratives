A neurologist reported via a TOUCH Prescribing Program Form that a male patient, on TYSABRI (300 mg, IV, QM) 
for Multiple Sclerosis from 24 May 2007 to 02 Nov 2010 and enrolled in a Biogen Idec sponsored marketing 
program of Monitored Therapy, was being evaluated suspicion of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy 
(PML, onset unknown). At the time of this report, the TOUCH database indicated that the patient received a total of 
77 infusions of TYSABRI from 24 May 2007 to 03 Sep 2013 (date of last dose discrepant). Additionally, in Feb 
2012, the patient tested negative for the presence of anti-JCV antibodies. Outcome and causality for the event of 
suspicion of PML are unknown. TYSABRI therapy was discontinued.
Update 08 Nov 2013: Additional information was provided by the neurologist who reported that the 36 year old male
patient definitely has PML (onset 2013) and is hospitalized (date unknown). The patient, initially diagnosed with 
Multiple Sclerosis in Sep 1999 and previously on Avonex (interferon beta-1a), enrolled in (b) (6)  and tested 
positive for JCV antibodies in Feb 2012 (discrepant from TOUCH form). History of prior immunosuppressant 
therapy is unknown. The patient was asymptomatic upon presentation, however, an MRI performed in early Oct 
2013 indicated the appearance of a new lesion on T2 FLAIR that increased in size in 20 days. CSF revealed 375 
copies/mL (name of testing institution not provided). Treatment includes GSCF for which the patient is on Day 3 at 
the time of this report. The neurologist reported the patient is currently doing well. The event is ongoing. Causality 
was not assessed.
Update 10 Nov 2013:(b) (6)  study records indicated that the patient tested positive [presumably for presence 
of anti-JCV antibodies] on 22 Feb 2011 and on 21 Feb 2012 (index was not available).
Update 16 Dec 2013: Additional information including 2 MRI reports was received from the neurologist via a 
research study manager. The patient did not experience any symptoms that prompted the PML evaluation. PML 
was observed on a scheduled routine MRI. At the time of this report, the patient was feeling well and was at 
baseline status. In addition to GSCF, treatment included Solu-Medrol (methylprednisolone sodium succinate) 1000 
mg IV x 3 days from 10 Dec 2013 to 13 Dec 2013. The report for the 06 Apr 2013 baseline MRI brain without 
contrast, compared to the prior MRI on 03 Dec 2012, indicated stable burden of demyelinating plaque in the supra- 
and infratentorial brain parenchyma and in the visualized upper cervical spinal cord; evaluation for acute 
demyelinating plaque is limited in the absence of IV contrast administration. Compared to the 06 Apr 2013 MRI, the 
report for the MRI brain without contrast performed on 12 Oct 2013 indicated the following: interval new/increasing 
size of demyelinating lesions in the anterior left cerebellar hemisphere/inferior left middle cerebellar peduncle; 
interval mild prominence of demyelinating lesions in the lateral aspect of the left middle/cerebellar peduncle, 
juxtacortical lesion in the left middle frontal gyrus and in the right superior frontal gyrus; stable to mild interval 
decrease in size of the juxtacortical lesion in the left superior frontal gyrus; no confluent T2/FLAIR lesion to suggest 
PML; no acute intracranial abnormality; stable, greater than age-appropriate volume loss.

Update 28 Jan 2014: Additional information was received from the neurologist via the research study manager 
including medical records (hospital Discharge Summary, JC virus results for lumbar puncture (LP) on 31 Oct 2013, 
and MRI results for 28 Oct 2013, 02 Dec 2013, 10 Dec 2013, and 06 Jan 2014). According to the Discharge 
Summary, the patient was hospitalized on (b) (6)  to undergo a LP due to the neurologist's concern for PML. 
Medical history includes hypertension being treated with Tenormin (atenolol) 25 mg PO tab. Prior to TYSABRI, the 
patient was wheelchair bound; the patient is currently walking without difficulty. Chronic left arm weakness persists 
and intermittent double vision has been stable. On (b) (6)  LP was performed under neuroradiology guidance 
and sent to (b) (6) labs for CSF analysis. Attempt to do LP at bedside was unsuccessful. LP results revealed JC 
virus DNA = 371 copies/mL (high). CSF tube number #1 revealed the following results: color = none; clarity = clear; 
RBC count 72 /UL (reference range: 0 - 0), gross blood = none (no reference range), WBC count 0 /UL (reference 
range: 0 - 10), protein 21.3 mg/dl (reference range: 7.0 - 35.0); glucose 60 mg/dl (reference range: 45 - 70); segs 
9% (reference range: 0 - 25); lymphocytes 55 (no reference range); large mono 36 (no reference range). The 
patient was discharged on (b) (6)  Discharge medications included Tenormin (atenolol) 25 mg PO tab, and 
Viagra (sildenafil) 50 mg PO tab for ED (erectile dysfunction). MRI brain with and without IV contrast on 26 Oct 
2013 compared to the previous MRI on 12 Oct 2013 indicated further interval increase in the size of the 
demyelinating plaque in the left middle cerebellar peduncle/cerebellar hemisphere as well as the lesion in the right 
inferior frontal white matter; no restricted diffusion or abnormal enhancement seen; the rest of the scattered 
supratentorial and infratentorial demyelinating lesions remained stable; no new lesion. MRI brain on 21 Nov 2013 
(actual report was not provided) indicated stable burden of demyelinating lesions; no new lesions were abnormal 
enhancement. MRI brain with and without IV contrast on 02 Dec 2013 compared to the previous MRI on 21 Nov 
2013 indicated interval increase in the size of the left cerebellar peduncle lesion, showing peripheral enhancement; 
the lesions measures approximately 2.5 cm in AP diameter and appears to have progressively increased in size on 
MRI studies since the study on 12 Oct 2013; findings may reflect an active demyelinating plaque but the possibility 
of PML/IRIS should also be considered in the proper clinical context; the rest of the demyelinating plaques in the 
supratentorial brain parenchyma, left thalamus, brainstem, and cervicomedullary junction remained unchanged 
from the prior study. MRI brain with and without IV contrast on 10 Dec 2013 compared to the previous MRI on 02 
Dec 2013 indicated further interval increase in size and enhancement of the heterogeneously enhancing lesion in 
the left anterior cerebellar hemisphere and left middle cerebellar peduncle; further interval prominence of the small 
nodular foci of enhancement surrounding this large heterogeneously enhancing lesion and also within the right 
cerebellar hemisphere, right middle cerebellar peduncle and right paramedian pons; imaging findings are 
concerning for PML with IRIS; stable burden of demyelinating plaques within the supra- and infratentorial brain 
parenchyma. MRI brain with and without IV contrast on 06 Jan 2014 compared to the previous MRI on 16 Dec 2013
(report not provided) revealed the diffuse T2 hyperintense lesion in the middle cerebellar peduncle and inferior left 
cerebellar hemisphere appeared to be stable in size cerebellum, however, there was interval decrease in liner 
enhancement along the anterior aspect of this lesion. Impression for the 06 Jan 2014 was not available since the 
fax was incomplete for this MRI. TYSABRI dosing frequency was changed from every four weeks to every eight

weeks starting with the infusion on 03 Sep 2013, however, TYSABRI therapy was discontinued after the 03 Sep 
2013 infusion. NOTE: The initial report indicating 02 Nov 2010 as the date of the last TYSABRI infusion was 
incorrect. The last infusion occurred on 03 Sep 2013.
Update 30 Jan 2014: Biogen Idec considers this case confirmed for PML on 30 Jan 2014 based on CSF and 
radiologic evidence received on 28 Jan 2014.
Update 12 Sep 2014: Information was received via a poster presented at the 2014 Joint Annual Meeting of the 
Americas Committee for Treatment and Research in Multiple Sclerosis (ACTRIMS) and the European Committee 
for Treatment and Research in Multiple Sclerosis (ECTRIMS), Boston, MA. Stefoski D, Balabanov R, Ko M, Strong 
J, Hernandez C, Muth C, Mercurio M, Javed A (September 2014). Fifteen non-fatal outcomes in natalizumab-
associated PML/IRIS: the effects of early diagnosis and evolving novel therapeutic approaches. The authors 
reported 15 patients with MS with PML occurring after 14-70 months of natalizumab treatments as well as 2 
additional PML patients in early phases of treatment and recovery.  Patient 4 refers to this case.  The patient was 
on TYSABRl for 7 years.  The patient presented asymptomatic in 2013 and was suspected for PML after a small 
MR lesion was seen on a follow-up MRI.  The patient's CSF was positive for JCV DNA at 371 copies/ mL 
(discrepant, previously reported as 375 copies/mL).  The patient was diagnosed with IRIS 2 weeks post PML 
diagnosis.  An MRI showed PML Gd+.  Treatment included filgastrim (the patient did not receive maraviroc or 
plasma exchange/ PLEX).  The patient recovered from PML at 9 weeks with residual gait ataxia.  At the time of 
publication the patient's EDSS was 1.5 and the Karnofsky was 90; the author noted there was no significant 
change.  The patient is currently employed.  A corresponding abstract (P858) was published in the Multiple 
Sclerosis Journal 20 (S2) 2014. Retrieved from msj.sagepub.com.
Update 23 Oct 2015:  Additional information provided by a friend of the male patient stated the patient was 
diagnosed with PML after taking TYSABRI (previously reported).  Additionally, it was reported that the male patient 
went blind (presume symptom of PML).  No further information provided.
Update 03 Nov 2015: Upon receipt of an inbound call from the friend of the male patient, the friend stated she 
heard of this information from another individual.  The patient had PML about four to five years ago (discrepant 
information) and that the patient was partially blind (presume symptom of PML).  At the time of this report the 
patient was not taking any MS medication.  No further information provided.
