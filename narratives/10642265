Medically Significant
A registered nurse spontaneously reported that a female patient on TYSABRI (unknown dose, unknown route, 
unknown frequency) for an unknown indication from unknown date to unknown date experienced unwell (onset 
unknown), "unhappy looking" MRI scan (onset unknown), and lumbar punctures for the USA for PML (onset 
unknown).  The patient is scheduled to undergo lumbar puncture [to test for PML].  The outcome for the events 
unwell, "unhappy looking" MRI scan, and lumbar punctures for the USA for PML is unknown. The causality for the 
events of unwell, "unhappy looking" MRI scan, and lumbar punctures for the USA for PML is unknown.  It is 
unknown if TYSABRI treatment is ongoing.
Update 11 Nov 2014: Follow-up information was received indicating receipt of a spinal fluid sample (presume for 
CSF JCV DNA testing).
Update 11 Nov 2014: Follow-up information was received from the initial registered nurse.  The patient was further 
identified with initials and date of birth.  The patient was diagnosed with MS in approximately 1997 and previous MS
therapy was Betaferon (interferon beta-1b).  The patient had no prior immunosuppressant history.  EDSS prior to 
TYSABRI was thought to be 4-5.  EDSS while on TYSABRI and at the time of PML suspicion was unavailable.  JCV
antibody status was positive (date and index unavailable).  TYSABRI was started on 15 Apr 2009, the patient 
received 64 infusions, TYSABRI was thought to be stopped in Aug 2014.  At that time, EDSS was 6.5.
Onset of clinical symptoms occurred in Jun 2014 and included brainstem relapse and balance declined.  On 07 Aug
2014, MRI was performed and was "highly suspicious."  CSF was collected on 11 Nov 2014 and results from 
(b) (6)  laboratories are pending (pendingresults presumed to refer to CSF JCV PCR).  The patient received 
treatment with steroids (2g, monthly) since Aug 2014.  The outcome indicated "the patient is pretty well now." The 
final diagnosis has not yet been reached.
Update 24 Nov 2014: This case was received from the MHRA (agency reference number: 22770026-001).  No 
further information was provided.
Update 25 NOv 2014: Follow-up information was received from a registered nurse.  The results of the JCV CSF 
PCR was >3,000 copies.  TYSABRI treatment was stopped 4 months ago. PML was suspected based on recent 
MRI. The physician is sure that it is PML now. The patient is static. No further information could be obtained.
Update 10 Dec 2014: Follow-up information was received from a physician.  The patient received 64 TYSABRI 
infusions. The patient was doing very well from EDSS 4.5 to 3 or even better during course of treatment then it 
plateaued.  The patient had a routine MRI scan on 08 May 2014, which was stable.  The last TYSABRI infusion was
on 07 Aug 2014.  The patient had not been doing well clinically recently. Patient was reviewed by registrar and

treatment was stopped due to relapse (various symptoms including diplopia). Patient was therefore offered 
alemtuzumab. Patient was started on monthly steroids then. Screening for alemtuzumab included an MRI scan, 
which was performed on 29 Oct 2014 and this was when PML was picked up. On MRI, there was some cerebellar 
volume loss and white matter disease in the posterior fossa.  The images were compared to the May MRI and there
were no lesions present in May. CSF JCV result was positive at >3000 copies/ml (previously reported result from 11
Nov 2014). Patient is now on tapered steroids and stable. New scan planned in the new year.  Diagnosis according 
to another physician was PML diagnosed retrospectively and the physician believed that the end of IRIS stage was 
picked up on the scan on 29 Oct [2014]; the steroids probably kept the IRIS under control. The physician also 
believed that the very first symptoms appeared in Mar / Apr 2014 although the May scan did not show any lesions 
and then things got worse. 
Update 10 Dec 2014: Follow-up information was received via a suspect PML data collection form.  MS was 
diagnosed on 21 Feb 2003 (previously reported as 1997).  Disease symptoms prior to suspected PML included 
difficulty of walking, bilateral ataxia, leg weakness, spasticity, and difficulty in speech (onset Nov 2001).  The patient
has not received prior immunosuppressant therapy.  Previous immunomodulatory therapy included Avonex 
(interferon beta-1a) and Betaferon (interferon beta-1b).  The suspect product was confirmed as TYSABRI (300 mg, 
IV, QM) administered from 09 Apr 2009 to 07 Aug 2014.  The patient was evaluated for PML due to signs and 
symptoms including cognitive/behavioral and speech (onset Mar 2014).  The signs and symptoms prompted MRI 
which revealed suspicious findings.  Prior to starting TYSABRI, on04 May 2014, lymphocyte count was 1.4 (normal 
range 1.0-3.5).  MRI on 08 May 2014 showed no change in appearance of the hyperintense periventricular white 
matter lesions since the previous scan.  There was no evidence of PML.  There was no intracranial hemorrhage or 
infarct.  Stable appearance.  Clinic note from 12 Jun 2014 descriped a brainstem relapse characterized by vertigo, 
nausea, increased imbalance, and impairment of blurred vision. The patient was treated with IV 
methylprednisolone.  The patient continued to feel nauseated and unsteady (presume previously reported balance 
declined).  The patient was administered prochlorperazine.  It was also noted that at that time, interval scan 
(presume MRI, no date provided) had "no features of PML."  Clinic note from 07 Aug 2014 indicated the patient had
had 64 total TYSABRI infusions.  The patient had a further relapse affecting her brainstem and manifesting with 
worsening INO, ataxia, and dysarthria.  EDSS deteriorated to 6.5.  The efficacy of TYSABRI was noted to have 
waned and the patient was scheduled to switch to alemtuzumab following a three month washout period and further
MRI of the brain an spine in November.  MRI on 29 Oct 2014 showed, compared to previous MRI, there was 
considerable increase in high signal intensity change in the posterior fossa which is bilaterally symmetrical in the 
brainstem and associated with marked loss of volume in both cerebellar hemispheres.  It was suspected to be 
inflammatory in etiology rather than due to PML.  Prior to PML suspicion, on 10 Nov 2014, lymphocyte count was 
1.8 (normal range 1.0-3.5).  CSF analysis on 11 Nov 2014 was normal.  The patient has not received treatment with
PLEX (plasma exchange) or immunoadsorption.  The final diagnosis was PML (IRIS) which was considered related
to TYSABRI.  The patient was treated with prednisolone, omeprazole, and alendronate.  The patient is currently at

Update 11 Dec 2014: This case was received from the MHRA (agency reference number: 22770026-002).  No 
further information was provided.
Update 18 Dec 2014: Biogen Idec considers this case confirmed for PML based on positive CSF, consistent 
radiologic findings, and clinical symptoms.
Update 19 Dec 2014: Follow-up information was received from the physician.  Anti-JCV antibody test was positive 
in Apr 2014 with an index of 2.279.  Monthly infusion record from 07 Aug 2014 reported increased vertigo, 
dizziness, nausea, diarrhea (clear of infection), and changes in walking, balance/coordination (presume previously 
reported balance declined and signs and symptoms of brainstem relapse).  MRI at the time of suspected PML 
diagnosis was performed on 29 Oct 2014.  Lumbar punctures performed on 20 Nov 2014 and 11 Nov 2014 were 
positive.  CSF JCV DNA testing on 11 Nov 2014 was positive at 3857 copies/ml.  CSF analysis from 14 Nov 2014 
showed clear colorless appearance, WBCs <1, RBCs 5, and culture showed no growth at 2 days.  Brain biopsy has
not been performed.  Laboratory testing on 18 Nov 2014 showed white blood cell count of 6.7, neutrophil count 3.3 
and lymphocyte count 2.6 (reference ranges not provided).  Office note from 20 Nov 2014 indicated the patient was 
relatively stable while awaiting the results of diagnostic CSF for JCV PCR.  It was thought to be highly likely to be 
PML.  The patient was receiving treatment with monthly methylprednisolone.  Review of a scan from Oct [2014] 
showed IRIS for which the patient was started on prednisolone, proton pump inhibitor for gastric prophylaxis 
(previously reported omeprazole), and alendronate for bone protection.  Office note on 25 Nov 2014 indicated that 
the patient would undergo further imaging of her brain in the new year [2015] and EDSS remained at 6.0.

Barcelona, Spain. The abstract stated that, a 48 year old female had received 91 doses of NTL (TYSABRI) and had
an EDSS of 6.0. She had a high JCV index and presented with a brainstem relapse responding to steroids. MRI of 
the brain was considered stable but she experienced a further brainstem relapse four months later. NTL was 
stopped and Alemtuzumab was being considered. A repeat MRI five months later showed cerebellar atrophy with 
high T2 signal. CSF confirmed 3800 copies of JCV.
Update 21 Oct 2015: Additional information was received from literature. The article, " Anti-JC virus antibody titres 
increase over time with natalizumab treatment" was authored by Raffel J, Gafson A, Malik O, and Nicholas R. The 
authors reported that the first patient, which was identified as a 48 year old female, had started natalizumab in 2012
(date discrepant), and had been seropositive on STRATIFY Gen 1. The patient's STRATIFY Gen2 anti-JCV Ab 
titers were 3.2 and 3.0 six months later.
Update 23 Oct 2015: Additional information was received from the neurologist via a Medical Science Liaison that 
confirmed this case represents the first patient in the literature article, "Anti-JC virus antibody titres increase over 
time with natalizumab treatment". The reporter added that the patient was on TYSABRI from 2009 until Aug 2014 
and received a total of 64 doses.
