Information was received on 19-May-2015 by Astellas license partner Mundipharma and received by Astellas on 
20-May-2015. This is an unsponsored study case reported by an investigator referring to a female patient who 
experienced neurological symptoms (suspected progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy)  with Bendamustine 
hydrochloride (Teva product cannot be ruled out) treatment.  The patient was enrolled in open label study BENDA 
Non-AST Study Interventional: Bendamustin (Study not sponsored by Astellas).
Other suspect drug(s) used were RITUXIMAB (non Teva) intravenous 375 mg/m2 other for Nodular (follicular) 
lymphoma starting from 19-Sep-2011 with the most recent dose prior to the event on 08-Sep-2014.
No medical history was provided. 
No concomitant medication information was provided. 
The patient received Bendamustine hydrochloride for Nodular (follicular) lymphoma according to the following 
dosage regimen(s): 06-Jan-2011  11-Jun-2011: intravenous 180 mg/m2, per protocol day 1 and day 2 of a 28 day 
cycle.
It was reported that on (b) (6)  the patient was hospitalized due to hearing difficulties which had developed 
over the previous two weeks. She developed an infection (no details provided) approximately two weeks prior to the
date of admission to the hospital; she had experienced chronic sinusitis, fever since two days from hospitalization 
and headaches. Approximately one and a half weeks prior to admission, she had been treated for tinnitus in an 
unspecified clinic (no details provided) due to aggravated hearing loss and several vertigo episodes, however 
without treatment success. Liquor cytology on (b) (6)  showed increased lymphocyte numbers without 
detection of oligoclonal bands. Later on an unspecified date an intravenous cortisone acetate stoss therapy was 
performed, followed by an oral phasing out scheme. These measures led to slight Improvement of hearing. On (b)(6)
 a cranial MRI without contrast agent showed supratentorial white matter lesions in both cerebral 
hemispheres. These however cannot be associated with any of her clinical symptoms. A repeated cranial MRI with 
and without contrast agent on (b) (6)  showed persistence of the white matter lesions without contrast 
enhancement. Upon consultation with her Oncologists it was decided to discontinue rituximab therapy; the patient 
received her last dose on (b) (6)  The event, neurological symptoms was the reason of hospitalisation but did
not prolong it. On (b) (6)  serum diagnostics showed positive JC-virus titres, liquor cytology was not altered 
and lymphocytic pleocytosis persisted. Taken together, a beginning PML was suspected. The patient was due to 
present to the clinic on 16-Dec-2014 to rule out PML. No signs of a relapse of her known NHL (Non-Hodgkin's 
lymphoma), granulomatous inflammation or cerebral lymphoma were seen. On an unspecified date, her 
pathological laboratory findings were: leucocytes count was 10.6 X 10^3/mcL (normal range: 4-10), absolute 
lymphocytes count was 4% (normal range: 25-40), Mean cell volume (MCV) was 95 fL (normal range: 80-94),

absolute neutrophil count was 93 % (normal range: 50 -70), immunoglobulin G (IgG) was 558 mU/ml (normal 
range: less than 100), potassium was 3.4 mmol/l (normal range: 3.5- 5,0), liquor leucocytes was 10/mcL (normal 
range: less than 5), plasma albumin was 3630 mg/dl (normal range: 3700-5100), C-reactive protein (CRP) was 3.4 
mg/dl (normal range: less than 1.0) and plasma IgG 681 mg/dI was (normal range: 700(1600); Details of laboratory 
tests such as brain biopsy, JC virus in CSF, IgM, CD20, CD8, CD4 were not reported. It was not reported regarding
storage of the patient's serum sample that was drawn within the previous 5 years of event onset. On (b) (6)
she was discharged from the hospital with medications cortisone, esomeprazole, pentoxifylline, dexpanthenol and 
sodium hyaluronate (Bepanthen eye) ointment, and Hydro Gel. On (b) (6)  she was using hearing aid device 
and hospitalised on same day. On (b) (6)  renewed diagnostic imaging showed the known infratentorial 
lesions, lumbar puncture continued to show an inflammatory lymphocytic pleocytosis. On (b) (6)  she was 
discharged from hospital. On (b) (6)  she was hospitalized to perform plasmapheresis to reduce rituximab 
level, three plasmapheresis therapies were performed (plasma exchange of 3 I) without complications. On (b) (6)
 she was discharged. On (b) (6)  she was hospitalised again due to impaired sensitivity and discreet 
paresis on left arm. The cerebrospinal fluid was found only low- positive for JC-virus(form (b) (6)  JC virus 
DNA 77 k/ml) for JC virus DNA, most likely still due to long-standing rituximab therapy. The cranial imaging was 
performed: CT performed on (b) (6)  and MRI performed on (b) (6)  showed a discreet enlargement of 
the cortical and sub/juxtacortical lesion as compared to previous imaging from (b) (6) . On (b) (6)  MR 
of the cervical spine showed disc prolapse at vertebrae 5/6, yet without compression of myelon or nerve roots. Labs
included B lymphocytes 2/ul (100-500), helper cells 254per ul(300-400), leukocytes 10.3x 10^3, lymphocytes 17 
percent (20-540), monocytes (optil) 11 percent (2-10), myelocytes (optil) 2 percent (0-1), neutrophils 77 percent 
(50-70), suppressor cells 60 percent of lymphocytes(10-30), EBV IgG 149 U/ml(less than 50), VZV IgG 276 
U/L(less than 100), ALT 62 U/I (less than 34), AST 63 U/I (less than 31), glucose 124 mg/dl(70-110), LDH 442 U/L 
(less than 247, cerebrospinal fluid: leukocytes 52/ul (0-5), plasma proteins: albumin 2580 mg/dl (3700-6100), CRP 
1.4 mg/dl(less than 1), lg G 312 mg/dl(700-1600), IgM 24 mg/dl(40-240). On (b) (6)  she was discharged. 
Discharge medication included esomeprazole, and prednisolone. On 14-Jan-2015, CSF cytometry did not show any
tumor cells. Cortisone therapy lead to marked improvement in the cytology of cerebrospinal fluid. On (b) (6)
she was again hospitalized due to increasing weakness of the left arm and of both legs, rhythmical fasciculation of 
the abdominal wall and light headaches and was diagnosed with non-Hodgkins lymphoma(in regression), status 
post plasmapheresis, long standing therapy with rituximab in the past and positive JC virus. She had  differential 
diagnosis with suspected progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, progressive tetraparesis of unknown origin 
and ataxia. On unknown date lumbar puncture was performed which revealed lymphocytic pleocytosis. On (b) (6)
 c MRT was performed. On (b) (6)  ECG showed alpha-rhythm sparse, beta activity and diffuse 
deceleration, picture of a mild overall alteration, repeated single and grouped polymorphous steep waves while 
duplexsonography and c MRT revealed a thrombosis with complete obliteration of the vena jugularis on the right 
side. It was possible that the placement of a central catheter for the recent plasmapheresis was the cause. She 
received full dose of heparin and subsequent oral anticoagulation with phenprocoumon (Marcumar). Thereafter,

headaches subsided. On (b) (6)  CT scan of chest and abdomen was performed for search of tumor but 
found to be unremarkable. On an unknown date, her state was deteriorated with worsening paresis and myoclonus 
of the abdominal wall. Additional diagnostic imaging MRI was performed for cervical and thoracic vertebral column 
and plexus brachialis which did not show relevant pathologies. On (b) (6) , ECG showed irregular waves, 
moderate alpha rhythm with frequency of 9 per seconds with theta activity, reaction on visual blockage completed, 
repeated temporal and central theta and delta waves, alpha-EEG with transition to slight overall alteration, 
discontinuation focal impairment in the right hemisphere temporal and central, rarely ETP s seen. Also follow up c 
MRT was performed which showed minimal changes. On (b) (6)  diagnostic imaging MRI was performed for 
cervical and thoracic vertebral column and plexus brachialis which did not showed relevant pathologies and 
neurography indicated bihemispheric damage and a complex severe nerve impairment with different affection of 
arm and leg. On (b) (6) cytology of cerebrospinal fluid showed no correlation to increase cell count, only 
lymphocytic, non-activated cells, no lymphoma cells or meningiosis. On, (b) (6)  ECG showed alpha rhythm 
per second spares, right centrally repeated small steep waves which was not entirely configured as ETPs. MRI was
performed for cervical and thoracic vertebral column and plexus brachialis which did not showed revelant 
pathologies. On (b) (6)  MRI showed progressive parenchyma lesions, in particular on the right, in the frontal 
and peri-ventricular and bilaterally in the fronto-parietal white matter. Along with symptoms and MRI alterations, it 
was observed that it was progressive leukocephalopathy and rituximab was not detectable hence therapy with 
mirtazapine was advised to be initiated. Due to rapid progression and conclusive diagnosis she was transferred to 
neurological department of university hospital hamburg eppendorf. On (b) (6)  she was discharged from the 
hospital and treated with prednisolone 20mg/d, esomeprazole 20mg/d, furosemide 40mg/d and phenprocoumon 
according to physician. (b) (6) , she was again hospitalized. On unspecified date, pathological laboratory 
parameters were performed as follows: Activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) 38 sec (normal range: 28-36), 
TSH basal 4.45 mU/I (0.30-4.20), B lymphocytes absolute 0 per mcg (100-500), T helper cells absolute 291 per ul 
(300-1400), leukocytes 10.9 10^3 per ul (4.0- 10.0), lymphocytes 18% (25-40), neutrophils 76% (50-70), suppressor
cells absolute 918 per ul (200-900), activated t lymphocytes 632 per ul (30-200), VZV IgG 610 mU/ml (less than 
100), ALT 79 u/l (less than 34), AST 51 u/l (35), GGT 39 U/l (less than 38), glucose 117 mg/dl (70-110), potassium 
3.2 mmol/l (3.5-5.0), LDH 299 U/l (less than 247), cerebrospinal fluid leukocytes 53 per ul (0-5), plasma protein IgG 
509 mg/dl (700-1600), plasma protein IgM 31 mg/dl (40-240). Later, she continued to show lymphocytic pleocytosis 
and CSF was positive for JC virus and suspicion of PML was diagnosed. FA CS analysis did not give hint of a 
hemato- oncologic disease. On an unspecified date, PET-CT was performed to rule out the recurrence of NHL but 
did not give proof of any suspicious, metabolically active lesions hence a relapse of NHL could not be ruled out. It 
was reported that rituximab level remained negative, hence plasmapheresis was not seen necessary. Oral 
cortisone therapy was tapered and a therapeutic attempt was made with intravenous immunoglobulins which 
caused a strong allergic reaction, so the therapy was discontinued. Later, prophylaxis with 
sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim (Cotrimoxazol) and aciclovir (Aciclovir) was commenced and tapering of cortisone 
did not improve immune status. It was reported that for leg spastics therapy with baclofen was initiated and

hypokalemia was treated and phenprocoumon therapywas continued due to status post sinus vein thrombosis. 
Later, spastic tetraparesis was worsened in further course with addition of reduced vigilance. On (b) (6)
following procedures were carried out during hospitalization: ergo therapy, oncological, medical-psychological, 
urological and gynecological evaluations. CSF showed sparse erythrocytes, no oligoclonal bands, lymphocytic 
pleocytosis, consistent with an inflammatory CNS process. On (b) (6)  c MRI was performed which showed 
progressive findings consistent with PML. It was reported that sinus vein thrombosis was improving. Therapy with 
levetiracetam (Keppra) and valproate sodium (Valproate) reduced her seizures. Overall less than the evnt PML was
progressive as there was no curative treatment she was transferred to hospice. On (b) (6)  she was 
discharged with aciclovir 1200mg per day, clindamycin 600 mg per day, emser salz 3 per day, esomeprazole 20mg 
per day, lactulose 15ml per day, levetiracetam 7 tablets per day, macrogol 3 sachets per day, mirtazapin 32 mg per 
day, phenprocoumon 1.5 mg per day, tizanidine 5 mg per day, valproate sodium 600 mg per day, 
sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim 260 mg twice a week, fentanyl patch every 3rd day, zolpidem 10 mg, ibuprofen 60 
mg as needed, lorazepam 0.5 mg as needed and macrogol as needed. On (b) (6)  she died. It was not 
reported whether autopsy was performed or not.
(b) (6)  Liquor cytology - showed increased lymphocyte numbers without detection of oligoclonal bands. 
(b) (6)  Cranial MRI without contrast agent showed supratentorial white matter lesions in both cerebral 
hemispheres.
(b) (6)  A repeated cranial MRI with and without contrast agent showed persistence of the white matter 
lesions without contrast enhancement. 
(b) (6)  serum diagnostics showed positive JC-virus titres, lymphocytic pleocytosis persisted.

ventricular and bilaterally in the fronto-parietal white matter.
(b) (6)  c MRI showed progressive findings consistent with PML.
Bendamustine hydrochloride treatment was stopped on 11-Jun-2011 prior to the onset of the event. 
The patient expired on (b) (6)  due to Neurological symptoms (suspected progressive multifocal 
leukoencephalopathy).
The outcome of Neurological symptoms (suspected progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy) was reported as 
fatal.
The Investigator assessed the following event with respect to Bendamustine hydrochloride: 
 - Neurological symptoms (suspected progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy) (seriousness: Death, 
Hospitalization; causality: Probable
The reporting investigator assessed the patient's neurological symptoms, suspected PML, as unrelated to therapy 
with rituximab.
No other causal relationships were reported.
Sender's comments: The Astellas Medical Reviewer assessed Neurological symptoms (suspected Progressive 
Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy) as serious due to death, hospitalization and the causal relationship to 
bendamustine hydrochloride as probable, in agreement with the reporting investigator.  Serum diagnostics 
indicative of positive JC-virus titres - in a setting of immunosuppression, was deemed a strong confounder.
