Medically Significant
On (b) (6)
A neurologist spontaneously reported that a  48 year old female patient on TYSABRI (300 mg, IV, QM) for Multiple 
Sclerosis from Aug 2007 to 26 Jul 2013 presented with MRI features consistent with PML diagnosis (MRI 
performed in late Jul 2013).
The patient had a medical history of multiple sclerosis since 2004. Previous MS background therapy included 
interferon beta, but no prior immunosuppressive therapy. In May 2011, the patient was tested positive for JCV 
antibodies.
In late Jul 2013, a routine brain MRI showed a new left parietal juxtacortical lesion non Gd-enhanced which was 
considered suspect for PML. No new neurological symptom/sign has been noticed and the patient was clinically 
well. A lumbar puncture was nevertheless performed on the same day and CSF samples were planned to be sent

On 09 and 10 Sep 2013
The treating neurologist reported that (b) (6)  JCV PCR testing returned negative whereas(b) (6)  JCV PCR testing 
was positive (number of copies unknown). The neurologist confirmed the diagnosis of PML. 
French Imputability: C2S2I2
Update on 17 and 20 Sep 2013
The neurologist reported that the last and 71th infusion was on 26 July 2013. The patient hasn?t experienced any 
interruption of TYSABRI therapy for a time of greater than 3 months. She was asymptomatic when PML was 
suspected.
The previous MRI before Jul 2013 was performed in May 2013 (results not provided). 
On (b) (6)  brain MRI showed MS demyelinating lesions already known. There was also left posterior parietal 
subcortical U fibers signal abnormality suggestive of PML.
On (b) (6)   brain MRI showed stable lesional load compared to brain MRI performed on (b) (6)
Furthermore, it revealed a slight extension of PML suggestive lesion presented as hypersignal in Flair and 
hyposignal T1 with neither mass effect nor Gd enhancement. There was no associated IRIS.
PCR JCV testing in CSF came back negative from a local laboratory (lumbar puncture done on(b) (6) ) and 
from (b) (6)  (lumbar puncture done on (b) (6) ) but PCR JCV test in CSF sent to(b) (6)  (lumbar puncture done 
on 14 Aug 2013) revealed 31 copies/ml. Other CSF analysis showed cell count < 1, protein at 0.51 g/l and glucose 
normal.
At the time of reporting, the patient hasn?t experienced any IRIS.  She was given Cidofovir (5mg/kg) and 
Mirtazapine (15mg per day) both since 02 Sep 2013 (still ongoing). Furthermore, she underwent 3 plasmatic 
exchanges respectively on (b) (6)  (b) (6)  and (b) (6)
EDSS score was 4.0 in Aug 2007 (prior to start TYSABRI), 4.0 on 26 Jul 2013 and 6.5 on 02 Sep 2013 (at time of 
PML diagnosis).  Karnofsky score was 90  in Aug 2007 (prior to start TYSABRI), 90 on 26 Jul 2013 and 60 on (b)(6)  
(b) (6)  (at time of PML diagnosis).
At this time of reporting, the patient was in rehabilitation/reeducation facility : she presented with severe 
monoparesia (right inferior limb), depressive mood and anxiety. She was able to walk with bilateral aid.

First signs of MS appeared in Jul 2004. Previous MS therapy included Betaferon (3 times a week) from Jul 2005 to 
May 2007. Prior to PML diagnosis, the patient presented with static cerebellar syndrome (gait ataxia) as bladder 
dysfunction (dysuria) as MS disease symptoms.
Biogen Idec considered this case to be a confirmed case of PML based on MRI and PCR JCV testing in CSF.

Update 25 November 2013:  Additional information received from the investigator.  The patient found to be enrolled 
in (b) (6)   This case is a clinical trial case report from France in Protocol Number (b) (6)  This case 
involved a 48-year-old female subject (ID#(b) (6) ).
The subject experienced her first symtoms of MS starting July 2004 characterized by dizziness (vestibular 
syndrome) and in 2005, hypoesthesia of the face and parethesia with left upper limb deficit.  In 2006 the subject?s 
EDSS was measured at 3.  On unspecified date the diagnosis of relapse remitting multiple sclerosis was made.
The subject's prior therapies included Betaferon (interferon beta-1a) which was stopped due to poor tolerance. The 
subject's past medical history included appendectomy. The subject had cutaneous allergy to nickel.  The subject 
did not have any children, no alcohol addiction but was an active smoker.  Her father was reportedly in good health,
while her mother had a stroke at the age of 70. Concomitant medications included Ceris (trospium chloride), 
Imovane (zopiclone), Scroplex (figwort, guaiacum, juniper berries, pareira, phytolacca decandra, water lily, 
xanthoxylum, yellow dock), and Laroxyl (amitriptyline). 
The subject received her first dose of commercially available TYSABRI (300mg, IV monthly) on 14 August 2007 
and subsequently enrolled in (b) (6)   According to the investigator the subject experienced no relapses during 
treatment with TYSABRI. At the time of the event the subject had received a total of 71 TYSABRI doses, with her 
last dose on 22 July 2013 (previously reported as 26 July 2013).  The last dose was reportedly tolerated well without
the occurrence of any adverse events. EDSS on 22 July 2013 was recorded at 3.5 and clinical signs were 
described by an amelioration of lower limb pain since treatment with Laroxyl (amitriptyline) had been initiated on 
unspecified date.
An opthalmologic exam previously performed 03 July 2013 revealed visual acuity (VA) of 10/10 in the right eye 
(RE), and 0.9 in the left eye (LE) (myopia), examination of the fundus of the eye revealed arteriosclerosis, while 
papilla and macula were normal.
On 30 July 2013 a routine brain MRI (every 3 months) revealed a left posterior parietal lesion with T2 hyperintensity,
T1 hypointensity, increased diffusion, no gadolinium uptake and no mass effect, subcortical, faint limits in white 
matter but clearly delimited in grey matter which was suggestive of PML. The suspicious lesion was not seen on the
MRI of January 2013.  A JCV [antibody] test previously performed on 05 May 2011 had been positive.

As a result the subject was admitted to hospital on (b) (6)  for further examination and lumbar puncture.
Clinical examinations were performed upon admission. Examination of  pyramidal function revealed a patellar 
tendon reflex sharper on the right, no Babinski, Hoffmann or Rossolimo reflexes, and no deficit noted; cereballar 
function: there was no dysmetria but static syndrome was noted with enlarged polygon of support and impossibility 
of walking in a straight line, multiple nystagmus, and upon Romberg?s test there was slight oscillation without 
lateralization.  Brain stem function was normal.  She had unlimited walking range, without help, and was reportedly 
in a sad mood. The subject had paresthesia of the lower limbs, of the right hand, and right half of face but no 
superficial or deep hypoesthesia.  She had loss of vibration sensation in the left upper limb. Urinary leakeage was 
noted one to several times per day.  Visual examination revealed VA 9/10 in the right eye and 4/10 in the left eye 
(needed new glasses) and VC normal to the finger. EDSS was thus noted at 4.0, and no peculiarity was noted.
Laboratory tests revealed normal haemostasis and complete blood count.  CSF samples taken showed WBC at 
less than 1/mm^3, RBC at less that 1/mm^3, sterile cultures, CSF proteins at 0.29 g/L, CSF sugar at 3.4 mmol/L 
(sugars in blood were measured at 7.2 mmol/L).  An initial JCV PCR done (Tenon) was negative (threshold = 500 
copies/mL).  JCV PCR from (b) (6)  done by (b) (6)  revealed 31 copies/mL.  A JCV PCR was also done by 
(b) (6)  labs (previously reported as negative). Anti-TYSABRI antibodies were negative (performed during this Aug 
hospitalization).
On (b) (6)  C-reactive protein (CRP) was measured at 5.8 mg/L. 
An EEG performed during hospitalization was normal, and an anti-TYSBRI antibody test was negative.
The patient was discharged on (b) (6)  with unchanged condition.
Treatment with TYSABRI was permanently discontinued with last dose on 22 Jul 2013.
A follow-up MRI was performed on (b) (6)  which revealed a slight increase in the size of the left posterior 
parietal lesion without enhancement.  The subject was subsequently admitted to neurology as an emergency.
Since (b) (6)  a right lower limb motor defecit was noted.
The subject was admitted to the general neurology unit on (b) (6)  for continued management of the event.
 Examination upon admission revealed walking was impossible without human assistance.  Pyramidal function: a 
motor deficit in the right lower limb with proximal predominance rated 4/5 was noted, and a tetrapyramidal 
syndrome with bilateral Babinski reflex was observed.  Cerebellar function: there was no ataxia, but mild static 
syndrome with a positive Romberg?s sign. Cranial nerve function was normal.  There was noted epicritic 
hypoesthesia and hypoallesthesia of the right lower limb.  Dysuria was noted and visual function was unchanged.
Reactive depression was observed.

A MRI performed on (b) (6)  revealed periventricular and subcortical supratentorial demyelinating lesions, 
and right cerebellar lesions consistent with known multiple sclerosis.  There was signal abnormality of the 
subcortical U fibers in the left posterior parietal region consistent with PML.
During hospitalization the subject received 3 plasma exchanges on (b)(6)  
(b)
(6)  and 
(b) (6)
Treatment also included medication with Norset (mirtazapine), cidofovir infusions, calciparine, and paracetamol.
A MRI performed (b) (6)  revealed a stable lesion load in comparison to the recent MRI ((b) (6)  
(b) (6) ).  There was a slight increase in the size of the lesion suggestive of PML in the left parietal/rolandic region 
and there was no indication of IRIS.
During hospitalization CRP was measured at 5.8 mg/L, urine proteinuria was noted (<0.1 g/L) and protein/creatinine
was measured at <0.02 g/mmol.
Laboratory tests done (b) (6)  revealed normal blood electrolytes, creatinine at 70 micromol/L, MDRD 
at 77 mL/min and Hb at 11.7 g/dL.
Mild normocytic anameia was noted.
Other blood and urine laboratory results were normal.
During the hospitalization there was an increase in the right lower limb motor deficit with distal motor testing rated at
2/5 and proximal 3/5.  Walking was still impossible without human assistance.
On (b) (6)  the subject was discharged to the rehabilitation unit.
On 23 September 2013 the subject was admitted to day hospital for the 3rd cidofovir infusion and continued 
management of the event.  Clinical examination revealed motor deficit rated 1/5 in the right lower limb, which made 
walking impossible, and a proximal motor deficit rated 4/5 in the right upper limb since 3 days prior.  The EDSS was
noted at 7.0.  The cidofovir infusion with concomitant administration of Probenecid was well tolerated.
On 07 October 2013 the subject was admitted to day hospital for the 4th cidofovir infusion which was well tolerated.
Clinical picture was rather unchanged; there was no improvement in motor defecit on the right side of the body and 
the subject was still unable to walk unaided.  There were no new symptoms elsewhere.  There was right 
hemiparesis: lower limb 0/5 distal, 2/5 proximal; upper limb 4/5 distal, 3/5 proximal. Proximal spasticity was greater 
than distal spasticity of the right upper limb.  EDSS was noted at 7.5. 
Laboratory tests from 04 October 2013 were normal with no proteinura.

Follow-up MRI on 07 October 2013 revealed enlargement of the left hemispheric lesion with forward extension and 
a discrete right posterior parietal lesion (new).  There was no clear evidence of IRIS.
EDSS in November 2013 was measured at 7.0.
At the time of this report the event was considered ongoing.  According to the investigator since the beginning of 
the event the subject has experienced ongoing worsening of cognitive and motor impairement.
The investigator considered the event related to TYSABRI.
Additional information was expected.
Update 19 March 2014: Additional information was received from the neurologist via a MS Standardized PML Data 
Collection Tool. The patient is alive, residing at rehabilitation facility and is currently on Rebif for MS therapy. The 
neurologist assessed the subject?s current clinical status as follows: recovery of speech disorder and mild 
improvement of right hemiparesis. The subject was diagnosed with IRIS which was determined by clinical 
symptoms and MRI finding. IRIS symptoms include speech (aphasia), motor (right hemiparesis) (onsets unknown), 
and seizure focal (onset 26 October 2013). IRIS treatment included corticosteroid regimen of methylprednisolone 
(five monthly courses). The neurologist assessed the subject?s estimated Karnofsky and EDSS scores on 19 
March 2014 to be 50 (requires considerable assistance and frequent medical care) and 8.0.  A brain MRI was 
performed on 19 March 2014 and results were not reported. No additional lumbar punctures have been done. As of
19 March 2014, the subject has not recovered from PML and has recovered from IRIS. Causality for the events was
assessed as related to TYSABRI.
Additional information was expected.
Update 06 August 2014: Additional information was received from a physician via a MS Standardized PML Data 
Collection Tool and diagnostic report. The subject is alive, residing at home, and is currently on Rebif (started Nov 
2013) for preventative MS therapy. On 25 June 2014, the physician assessed the subject?s estimated Karnofsky 
and EDSS scores to be 50 to 60 (requires considerable assistance and frequent medical care - requires occasional
assistance, but is able to care for most of her personal needs) and 7.0 to 7.5 respectively. The most recent brain 
MRI was performed on 19 March 2014, with results reported as follows: (comparison to MRI study dated 11 
December 2013) shows stability of lesions apart from disappearance of contrast enhancement at the right junction 
area and decrease of mass effect, showing a favorable evolution. The patient has recovered from PML and IRIS. 
Causality for the events was assessed as related to TYSABRI.
