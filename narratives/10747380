Medically Significant
A neurologist sponaneously reported via a Biogen Idec employee (Medical Science Liaison) that a patient (missing 
patient's identifiers) on TYSABRI (300 mg, IV, QM) for an unknown indication from unknown date to unknown date 
experienced suspicion of PML (onset unknown). Treatment and lab testing for the event were not report. The 
outcome for the event suspicion of PML is unknown. The causality for the event of suspicion of PML is unknown.  It 
is unknown if TYSABRI treatment is ongoing.
Update 17 Oct 2014: On the same day of the initial report, the neurologist provided the patient's identifier and this 
case became valid. The female patient was considered a high-risk patient due to previous MS treatment with 
mitoxantrone. TYSABRI therapy was withdrawn on unknown date. Lumbar puncture was scheduled for 20 Oct 
2014. No further information was provided.
Update 19 Nov 2014: The neurologist spontaneously reported via a Biogen Idec employee (Medical Science 
Liaison) that the patient started Maraviroc (details not provided) two weeks ago. The patient was doing well. No 
further information was provided.
Update 19 Jan 2015: Upon follow-up, the neurologist reported via a Biogen Idec MSL that the female patient was 
on TYSABRI therapy from 10 Oct 2007 until Jul 2008. Subsequently, there was a therapy interruption and TYSABRI
was restarted on 01 Mar 2010 and then discontinued due to suspicion of PML in Sep 2014. TYSABRI had not been 
administered every four weeks due to insufficient therapy adherence; therefore the total number of TYSABRI 
infusions was unknown. The patient was diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis in 1984 and treated with mitoxantrone 
(total dose of 320 mg) and Rebif (interferon beta-1a). The patient tested positive for anti-JCV antibodies on an 
unknown date. The patient presented first clinical symptoms of dizziness and unsteady gait at the beginning of Sep 
2014. The patient was unable to walk any longer. EDSS at that time was 7.0. Of note, the patient had been 
previously experiencing personality changes.  On an unknown date, CSF JCV DNA (local) was 2300 copies/ml. 
The following brain MRI results were reported: 16 Jan 2014: Known MS with evidence of supra- and infratentorial 
lesions characterized by moderate to distinct lesion volume and partial to significant axonal loss indicated on native 
T1-weighted images. Whole brain atrophy more pronounced in the internal regions. No certain contrast enhancing 
lesions. Compared with previous examination from Dec 2013, new questionable lesions temporal periventricular on 
the right side were not increased in size. No further relevant changes. 29 Apr 2014: No contrast enhancing lesions. 
Findings not changed compared with previous examination form Jan 2014. 12 Aug 2014: No contrast enhancing 
lesions. Findings not changed compared with previous examination from Apr 2014. 16 Oct 2014 and 03 Nov 2014: 
Indication - suspicion of PML. No imaging findings provided. 10 Dec 2014: Indication - Follow up of PML, 
deterioration. No imaging findings provided. 18 Dec 2014: Indication - Follow up of PML. Compared with previous 
examination from 10 Dec 2014, there were only subtle changes seen. However, contrast enhancement was slightly

decreased in both cerebellar hemispheres. Mild signs of brain atrophy were now demonstrated also in the medio-
basal cerebellar region on the left side. These affected left basal cerebellar areas appeared with somewhat more 
signal intensity on the FLAIR images. No further relevant changes. 13 Jan 2015: Indication - Follow up of PML. 
Given known PML in this patient, increased T2-signal in the pons now reaching broader to cranial region and to the 
right crus cerebri on axial images was demonstrated comparing to the previous examination from 18 Dec 2014. 
Similar to the previous exam, weak streaky cerebellar contrast enhancing lesions were seen bilaterally as well as 
signs of brain atrophy particularly in the medio-basal cerebellar region on the left side. Diffusion disturbance in the 
left cerebellar basal area appeared somewhat increased, whereas questionable discrete regression of diffusion 
disturbance in the right cerebellar area was seen. No new MS lesions. No further relevant changes.
The patient was diagnosed with PML and treated with immunoadsorption, maraviroc, mirtazapine, cortisone pulse 
therapy and two cycles of immunoglobulins (five days in each cycle). No IRIS had been observed in this patient at 
the time of this report and the patient's EDSS was 8.0. Treatment included Fampyra (fampridine) and amantadine. 
No further information was provided.
Update 22 Jan 2015: On 22 Jan 2015, Biogen Idec considers this case confirmed for PML based on positive CSF, 
consistent radiological findings, and clinical symptoms.
