AER 1599208 is a spontaneous case, received on 24/Jun/2015 from a physician via company representative via 
health authority (Italy AIFA, source id 315795) and concerns an 80 year old male patient who developed 
progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, sopor, temporospatial disorientation and died whilst being treated with 
rituximab (Mabthera).
Concomitant medications included cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin hydrochloride, vincristine sulfate, prednisone, 
vinblastine. Medical history. Concurrent conditions and past drugs were not reported.
On an unspecified date in Mar/2015, patient was diagnosed with stage IIIB large B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma 
and myelodysplastic syndrome type, refractory cytopenia with multilineage dysplasia. On 18/Mar/2015 his IgG was 
1310 mg/dL and absolute neutrophil count was 4630/mm^3, also WBC count was 7400/mm^3. On 01/Apr/2015 he 
received subcutaneous rituximab 1400 mg injection once a day for diffuse large B cell lymphoma. On 10/Apr/2015 
he received intravenous rituximab 375mg/mq (858 mg) (130013B15) once in 21 days for diffuse large B cell 
lymphoma. On 04/May/2015 therapy with intravenous rituximab was stopped. On 19/May/2015 he developed 
progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), sopor and  temporo spatial disorientation. Major complication 
he experienced include intestinal occlusion due to abdominal mass. He has done brain magnetic resonance 
imaging at the event onset. On 26/May/2015 he started therapy with subcutaneous rituximab 1400 mg once in 21 
days for diffuse large B cell lymphoma also third cycle of immuno chemotherapy was performed according to the R-
COMP regimen with subcutaneous rituximab and chemotherapeutic agents at a dosage reduced by 25% (reduction
due to his general clinical conditions and age). On the same day therapy with subcutaneous rituximab was stopped.
At the time of event onset he received 2 cycles of intravenous rituximab and 1 cycle of subcutaneous rituximab. On 
29/May/2015 therapy with subcutaneous rituximab was stopped. Between Apr - May/2015 2 cycles of 
immunochemotherapy were performed in accordance with the R-COMP regimen (rituximab IV, liposomal 
doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, vinblastine) prednisone. On (b) (6)  his absolute neutrophil count was 
4400/mm^3 and WBC count was 5000/mm^3 also he came for monitoring in soporous state. He was disoriented 
with respect to space and time. It was reported that, the symptoms had appeared approximately 2 days prior. His 
head computerised tomogram was performed revealing evidence of a hypodense lesion in the right temporo polar 
area, and he was admitted in neurology department where he underwent an magnetic resonance imaging of the 
head with contrast agent, and was discharged with a diagnosis of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy. 
During his hospitalisation, no investigation of John Cunningham virus took place. On 16/Jun/2015 his absolute 
neutrophil count was 2560/mm^3 and WBC count was 3700/mm^3. On (b) (6)  he died. It was reported that, 
if he was suffering from Herpes simplex or had immunodeficiency was unknown. Also he was not suffering from 
chronic viral infections, human immunodeficiency virus, herpes zoster, CMV pneumocystic carinii pneumonia, or 
known CNS pathology. It was reported that he did not have history of opportunistic infections. He did not receive 
bone marrow or solid bone transplant.

FOIA Case Report Information
At the time of this report, the outcome of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, sopor and  temporo spatial 
disorientation was fatal. 
The physician did not assess the causal relationship between progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, sopor,
temporo spatial disorientation with rituximab (subcutaneous and intravenous).
No further information was provided.
Additional information received on 29/Jun/2015. Following information was added to case: Phone number and 
email address of reporter, additional reporter, patient details, signs and symptoms of event were sopor, time and 
spatial disorientation, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, complete indication for the use of rituximab was 
large B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma with blastic morphology. It was diagnosed on an unspecified date in / 
Mar/2015. Major complication of the disease that he experienced was intestinal occlusion due to abdominal mass, 
prior to the onset of the adverse event, he received two cycles of chemotherapy with rituximab (intravenous, 858 
mg, 375 mg/mq), vinblastine sulfate( 5.55 mg intravenous, 3.7 mg/ mq), doxorubicin hydrochloride(75 mg 
intravenous, 50 mg/mq) and cyclophosphamide (1125 mg intravenous, 750 mg/mq): one on 10/Apr/2015 and one 
on 04May2015. At time of the onset of the event he received a cycle on 26/May/2015 with switch to subcutaneous 
rituximab(1400 mg). His medical history and clinical conditions, lab tests were added.
Health authority and source identification number, primary reporter changed, additional reporters, race of patient, lot
number and additional dosing regimen of subcutaneous rituximab, dosing regimen of cyclophosphamide and 
doxorubicin hydrochloride, concomitant vinblastin, additional events sopor and temporo spatial disorientation were 
added.
Expiry date of rituximab was added. The primary reporter specified that, first symptoms occurred on 01/Jun/2015 
when he was examined by the physician and he reported that sopor started two days before. He died on

Additional reporters added. The same case was received via roche key account manager, who was contacted by a 
hospital pharmacist.
The patient was diagnosed with stage IIIB large B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and myelodysplastic syndrome 
type, Refractory cytopenia with multilineage dysplasia. Between Apr - May/2015, 2 cycles of immunochemotherapy 
were performed in accordance with the R-COMP regimen (rituximab IV, liposomal doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, 
vinblastine) prednisone). On 26/May/2015, the third cycle was performed according to the R-COMP regimen with 
subcutaneous rituximab and chemotherapeutic agents at a dosage reduced by 25% (reduction due to his general

disoriented with respect to space and time. His relations reported that the symptoms had appeared approximately 2
days prior. For this reason, a head computerised tomogram was performed, revealing evidence of a hypodense
