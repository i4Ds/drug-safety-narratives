This spontaneous report was received from the mother of a 2 year old Caucasian female regarding Acetaminophen
32 mg/mL Child Cherry Suspension and Ibuprofen 20 mg/mL Child Berry Suspension. The child began receiving 
both products on 29SEP2015 for pain; the doses of the products were alternated. Every six hours, the child 
received two teaspoons of either the Acetaminophen 32 mg/mL Child Cherry Suspension or the Ibuprofen 20 
mg/mL Child Berry Suspension. On 02OCT2015, the child began experiencing hives and redness all over her body;
the mother further described the hives as small bumps that were worse on the childs arms and legs. The 
Acetaminophen 32 mg/mL Child Cherry Suspension was discontinued on 02OCT2015.  The Ibuprofen 20 mg/mL 
Child Berry Suspension taken every 12 hours regimen was stopped on 02OCT2015, and on 03OCT2015 the child 
began to receive the product at a dose of two teaspoons every 6 hours.  The mother reported treating the events 
with Eucerin cream. As of 05OCT2015, the child continued to receive only the Ibuprofen 20 mg/mL Child Berry 
Suspension, and the hives and redness had improved. The mother noted that the child had previously used 
unspecified acetaminophen (at a does of 1.5 teaspoons every six hours as needed) for an unspecified indication in 
2014 without experiencing any issues. The mother noted that the child possibly had an allergy to dyes, but had no 
known drug allergies. No further information is expected.
