This case report from a patient in the USA was initially received at EMD Serono on 19 Jul 2012 and was assessed 
as non-serious. Additional information received from a patient on 23 Jul 2012 changed the status of the case to

2012 to an unknown date and received a 22 mcg of Rebif on 18 Jul 2012 for multiple sclerosis.
On 18 Jul 2012, the patient took her first injection of the 22 mcg dose of Rebif and at 3:00 am the following day 
experienced flu like symptoms, characterized by not feeling well,  chills, and achiness which would not go away. 
The patient premedicated with aspirin 81mg as treatment and denied having flu like symptoms while on the 8.8 mcg

well as a high blood pressure of 270/240, and went to the emergency room. The patient had not experienced high 
blood pressure over the past year, while on Copaxone. The patient was admitted and treated with clonidine, which

shots. The patient reported that Rebif caused her blood pressure to be elevated to 270/24 where she had to be 
hospitalized, the patient was not seeing and that she was positive for the John Cunningham virus. The patient's last
