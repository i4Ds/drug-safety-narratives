Medically Significant
A neurologist reported that a 42 year old female patient on TYSABRI (300 mg, IV, QM) for an unknown indication 
from 01 Oct 2008 to 01 Oct 2012 experienced PML suspicion (onset 01 Oct 2012). No relevant medical history or 
concomitant medication was reported. On an unknown date an MRI was performed and the patient was found to 
have new cortical lesions considered suspicious for PML. The patient also presented with some cognitive troubles. 
The outcome for the event PML suspicion is unknown. The causality for the event of PML suspicion is unknown.
TYSABRI therapy was stopped temporarily on 01 Oct 2012.
Update 05 Oct 2012: Additional information was received from the neurologist. The patient tested positive for JCV 
on an unknown date. She had already been treated with TYSARI since 48 months. A lumbar puncture (LP) was

performed on 01 Oct 2012. CSF PCR results were pending. The patient had no clinical worsening but some 
cognitive troubles. 
Update 08 Oct 2012: Additional information was received from the neurologist who provided the CSF (b) (6)  report. 
The result of the JCV PCR quantitative test performed on CSF taken on 01 Oct 2012 was positive at 1271 
copies/ml.
Update 08 and 09 Oct 2012: Upon internal review this case was considered confirmed for PML based on positive 
CSF, clinical symptoms, and MRI consistent with PML. MRI images on CD from 12 Sep 2011, 20 Mar 2012, and 03
Sep 2012 were provided; however, the MRI reports were not available. 
Update 22 Nov 2012: Additional information was received from a physician via a MS Standardized PML Data 
Collection Tool. (Prior to starting TYSABRI) the physician assessed the patient's estimated Karnofsky and EDSS 
scores on 23 Sep 2008 to be 90 (able to carry on normal activity; minor signs or symptoms of disease) and 2.0. On 
29 Jul 2012 the patient tested positive for anti-JCV antibody status. (On TYSABRI prior to PML) the physician 
assessed the patient's estimated Karnofsky and EDSS scores on 03 Sep 2012 to be 90 and 2.0 and (at time of 
PML diagnosis) the estimated Karnofsky and EDSS scores on 27 Sep 2012 to be 70 (cares for self; unable to carry 
on normal activity or to do active work) and 2.5. On 28 Sep 2012 the patient had an MRI done (results not 
reported). The patient is currently residing at home. The patient has not recovered from PML and causality was 
assessed as related.
Update 10 Apr 2013: Additional information was received from the treating neurologist via a MS Standardized PML 
Data Collection Tool. The patient is alive, residing at home and is not currently on any therapy for MS. The 
neurologist reported the patient cannot work or drive but is otherwise independent. She is described as having 
tremor of the right arm (motor) and moderate aphasia (cognitive). The patient was diagnosed with IRIS by clinical 
symptoms and MRI findings. Clinical symptoms included (seizure, focal) aphasia and tonic-clonic movements of 
right arm (onset 15 Nov 2012). The patient was treated for IRIS with corticosteroids. Treatment included 
Methylprednisolone 1 gram IV 1x/day (11 Oct 2012 to 13 Oct 2012 and 14 Nov 2012 to 16 Nov 2012). The 
neurologist assessed the patient's estimated Karnofsky and EDSS scores on 08 Apr 2013 to be 70 (cares for self; 
unable to carry on normal activity or to do active work) and 3.0. On 08 Apr 2013 the patient had an MRI of the brain 
done (result not reported) and underwent a lumbar puncture (result pending). The patient has recovered from IRIS 
but has not recovered from PML. Causality for the events of PML and IRIS was assessed as related to TYSABRI.

FOIA Case Report Information
Update 30 Apr 2013: The treating neurologist provided the test results from (b) (6)  Labs for the 08 Apr 2013 JC 
Virus DNA ultrasensitive quantitative real time PCR test, which were negative.
Update 07 Oct 2013: Additional information was received from the treating neurologist via a MS Standardized PML 
Data Collection Tool. The patient is alive, residing at home, and is currently on Avonex (started 25 May 2013) for 
MS therapy. The patient has mild aphasia, right hand tremor, and dysmetria. She is independent at home but does 
not work. The neurologist assessed the patient?s estimated Karnofsky and EDSS scores on 30 Sep 2013 to be 70 
(cares for self; unable to carry on normal activity or to do active work) and 2.5. A brain MRI was performed on 13 
Sep 2013 with results reported as reduction of the lesions in the context of the PML. No difference (status quo) 
regarding the demyelinating lesions. No additional lumbar punctures have been done. The patient has not 
recovered from PML and IRIS. Causality for the events were assessed as related to TYSABRI.
Update 08 Apr 2014: Additional information was received from the neurologist via a MS Standardized PML Data 
Collection Tool. The subject is alive, residing at home, and is currently on Avonex (started 25 May 2013) for MS 
therapy. The patient?s current clinical status was reported as follows: suffers from epileptic seizures (tonic-clonic 
movements of right arm) and receives high doses of two anti-epileptic drugs. The patient continues suffering from 
dysarthria, clumsy movements of right hand, and cognitive difficulties. The neurologist assessed the subject?s 
estimated Karnofsky score (date unspecified) to be 70 (cares for self; unable to carry on normal activity or to do 
active work) and assessed the EDSS score on 27 Mar 2014 to be 2.5. A brain MRI performed on 31 Jan 2014 
showed no evolution. No additional lumbar punctures have been performed. The patient has not recovered from 
PML and IRIS. Causality for the event of PML was assessed as related to TYSABRI. Causality for the event of IRIS 
was assessed as not related to TYSABRI.
Update 07 Oct 2014: Additional information was received from the neurologist via a MS Standardized PML Data 
Collection Tool. The patient is alive, residing at home, and is currently on Avonex (since May 2013) for preventative 
MS therapy. The neurologist assessed the patient?s estimated Karnofsky and EDSS scores on 06 Oct 2014 to be 
70 (cares for self; unable to carry on normal activity or to do active work) and 2.5, respectively. A brain MRI 
performed on 26 Sep 2014 showed no new lesions. The patient has not recovered from PML and has not 
recovered from IRIS. Causality for the events was assessed as related to TYSABRI.
