Medically Significant
A neurologist spontaneously reported via a Biogen Idec Employee that an adult female patient (initials and age 
unknown) on TYSABRI (300 mg, IV, QM) for relapsing remitting Multiple Sclerosis from unknown date to 16 Dec 
2014 experienced PML suspicion (onset 16 Dec 2014).  The patient received her last TYSABRI infusion on 16 Dec 
2014 when the patient reported that she had language difficulties (onset unknown) and a right deficit (NOS) (onset 
unknown) evolving for a few weeks. A MRI performed on 16 Dec 2014 revealed a lesion suggestive of PML.  No 
treatment for the events was reported. The outcome for the events language difficulties and right deficit is unknown.
 The event of PML suspicion is ongoing. The causality for the events of PML suspicion, language difficulties, and 
right deficit is unknown. TYSABRI therapy was discontinued.  French Imputability: C1S1I1
Update 18 Dec 2014:  Additional Information was provided by the neurologist.  The patient's initials and date of birth

was provided. The 24 year old female patient started TYSABRI on 21 Apr 2011 and had never been treated with 
immunosuppressive drugs. On 16 Dec 2014, a TYSABRI infusion was administered when the patient reported that 
she experienced speech disorders (previously reported as language difficulties) and clumsiness in the right arm 
(previously reported as right deficit) which started 2 weeks ago (presume Dec 2014).  Anti-JCV antibodies serology 
was positive (date not provided).  A MRI performed on 16 Dec 2014 revealed a very suggestive PML lesion in the 
left juxta cortical fronto insular aera with no clear outlines and with slight punctiform Gd enhancement. This 
suggestive PML lesion didn't appear on the previous MRI performed 3 months ago. Lumbar puncture was done on 
17 Dec 2014 for JCV PCR testing. The patient underwent the 1st plasmatic exchange on 17 Dec 2014 and the 2nd 
one was planned on 19 Dec 2014.  TYSABRI was withdrawn on 16 Dec 2014 (last infusion date). French 
Imputability: C1 S1 I1
Update 20 Mar 2015:  A different neurologist spontaneously reported on a DCT form filled out on 22 Jan 2015 that 
this female patient experienced first signs of MS in Sep 2010 and was diagnosed with MS at the same time in Sep 
2010.  MS disease symptoms prior to PML suspicion were cerebellar with right dysmetria and dysuria. Before 
TYSABRI, prior DMT only included Copaxone (glatiramer) SC QD from Oct 2010 to 2011 (unspecified date) for MS.
TYSABRI was started on 21 Apr 2011 and the patient had received a total of 46 monthly infusions before stopping 
treatment. She did not experience any interruption of TYSABRI for greater than 3 months before stopping TYSABRI
on 16 Dec 2014 (last infusion). On 17 Dec 2014, the patient was tested positive for serum anti-JCV antibody with 
index value at 3.4 ((b) (6) ). The reasons why the patient was being evaluated for PML were as follow: patient 
presented with suggestive clinical signs and symptoms which prompted MRI which revealed suspicious findings. 
The presenting signs and symptoms which led to the evaluation for possible PML were: motor disorder with right 
arm paresis (MRC scale 4+/5) and speech disorder with mild dysphasia. The last brain MRI before PML suspicion 
was performed on 06 Oct 2014 (results not provided); MRI study which revealed suggestive PML lesions was 
performed on 16 Dec 2014 (no other information given; results previously reported). A lumbar puncture was 
performed on 17 Dec 2014 for PCR JCV testing in CSF at (b) (6)  laboratory which returned positive (NOS, the 
physician lost the (b) (6)  report). No other CSF analysis was performed. Pre-PLEX test results at the time of PML 
suspicion on 17 Dec 2014 were: absolute leukocyte count 17.2 G/L, absolute lymphocyte count 3.26 G/L.  CD4 was
quantified at 1.49 G/L, CD8 at 1.36 G/L and CD4/CD8 1.09 on 17 Sep 2014. The neurologist considered that PML 
was confirmed in this patient based on results of MRI and positive JC PCR testing in CSF. As corrective PML 
treatment, the patient underwent 5 sessions of plasmatic exchange from 17 to 21 Dec 2014 (1/day). PML treatment
also included: mirtazapine 30 mg/day started on 21 Dec 2014, Celsentri (maraviroc) 2 tablets started on 21 Dec 
2014, and G-CSF (granulocyte colony stimulating factor, NOS) 300 mcg/day from 23 to 28 Dec 2014.  At the time 
of filling the form, the patient's current location was at home, she was not receiving any MS disease therapy. The 
neurologist specified that the patient has never been enrolled in a clinical study (promoted by Biogen Idec or not). 
No further information was provided. French Imputability: C2S2I2.

Update 23 Mar 2015: (b) (6)  laboratory reported that CSF JCV PCR test result of lumbar puncture 
performed on 17 Dec 2014 was 601 copies/ml. No other information was provided.  French Imputability: C2S2I2.
Update 26 Mar 2015:  Upon internal review, Biogen considers this case to be confirmed for PML based on positive 
CSF, consistent MRI, and clinical symptoms.
Update 27 Aug 2015:  A report was received from literature.  Unknown L and Unknown A.  A homage to our sister, 
this angel in the sky.  Faireface.  01 Sep 2015:  739; 01.  The following additional information as provided.  The 
patient experienced flares (presumed MS) for which she was hospitalized (onset and dates of hospitalization not 
reported).  Treatment included "treatment" (NOS), self-catheterization, physiotherapy, and walking sticks.  The 
patient was diagnosed with PML on 16 Dec 2014 and hospitalized multiple times (dates not reported).  Treatment 
included hemapheresis (presumed plasmapheresis), HIV treatment (presumed in reference to treatment with 
maraviroc), and treatment for malignancy/ cancer (NOS).  The patient's psychomotor disorder worsened and she 
died on (b) (6)  (cause of death presumed to be PML).
