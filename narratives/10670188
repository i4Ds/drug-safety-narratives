A neurologist spontaneously reported that a female patient on TYSABRI (300 mg, IV, QM) for Multiple Sclerosis 
from unknown date to 02 Oct 2014 came under suspicion for progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) 
(onset unknown).  TYSABRl therapy was discontinued with the goal of starting Gilenya (fingolimod) and the 
patient's last dose of TYSABRl was administered on 02 Oct 2014 (the patient did not start Gilenya).  On an 
unknown date the patient tested positive for anti-JCV antibodies.  Testing included an MRI that showed new lesions
and non-Gd enhancing lesions.  An additional risk factor for development of PML included TYSABRl therapy for 
more than 2 years.  Treatment included mirtazapine and high doses of corticosteroids (NOS).  No plasma 
exchange (PLEX) was planned.  The event of suspected PML is ongoing.  The neurologist assessed causality as

related.  TYSABRl therapy was previously discontinued.
Update 15 Dec 2014:  Additional information was received via a Multiple Sclerosis PML Data Collection Form:
Suspect.  The patient was being evaluated for PML due to clinical signs and symptoms that prompted an MRI.
Symptoms included left hemiparesis and dysarthria since (b) (6)   An MRI at the time of PML suspicion was 
done on (b) (6)   An MRI prior to PML suspicion was done on 13 Jun 2014.  A lumbar puncture was done on 
(b) (6)   The patient tested positive for anti-JCV antibodies on (b) (6)  with an index value of 2.817 and 
on 03 Nov 2011.  No brain biopsy has been performed.  Laboratory testing prior to the start of TYSABRl therapy, on
03 Sep 2010, included leukocytes of 8.9/uL (reference range 3.9 to 10), lymphocytes of 21% (reference range 20 to
50) and absolute lymphocyte count of 1.9/uL (reference range 1.2 to 3.4).  Testing on TYSABRl (within product 
exposure), prior to PML suspicion, on (b) (6) , included leukocytes of 9.4 /uL, lymphocytes of 12.4% and 
absolute lymphocyte count of 1.2 /uL.  A CSF analysis was performed on (b) (6)  and was normal.  At the time
of this report, the patient was hospitalized.  The patient was on TYSABRl therapy from 03 Sep 2010 to 02 Oct 2014.
 The patient has not experienced an interruption of TYSABRl for greater than 3 months.  The patient was 
diagnosed with MS on 17 Jun 1996.  MS symptoms included paraparesis in Jun of 1996 and Jul 2010, hipoesterix 
(presumed hypoesthesia) in Oct 1997, and diplopia in Jul 1999.  The patient has not received prior 
immunosuppressant therapy.  Prior immunomodulatory therapy included Betaseron (interferon beta-1b).  The 
patient has not had plasma exchange (PLEX).  Treatment included mefloquine, mirtazapine, and corticosteroids 
(NOS).
Update 16 Dec 2014:  The laboratory provided the following additional information.  Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from 
a lumbar puncture (LP) on (b) (6)  tested positive for JCV DNA at 1,240 copies/ mL (lower level of detection 
unknown).
Update 16 Dec 2014:  The neurologist provided the following additional information.  The patient is enrolled in the 
(b) (6)   The patient tested positive for anti-JCV antibodies on 03 Nov 
20122 and 27 Nov 2013 with an index value of 2.817.  Laboratory testing prior to the start of TYSABRl therapy, on 
03 Sep 2010, included leukocytes of 8.9 mil/uL (reference range 3.9 to 10), lymphocytes of 21.5% (reference range
20 to 50) ad 1.9 mil/uL (reference range 1.2 to 3.4), and neutrophils of 71.5% (reference range 37 to 72) and 6.4 
mil/uL (reference range 1.5 to 6.5).  Testing on TYSABRl (within product exposure), prior to PML suspicion, on 10 
Dec 2014, included leukocytes of 9.4 mil/uL, lymphocytes of 12.4% and 1.2 mil/uL, and neutrophils of 77.1% and 
7.1 mil/uL.
Update 16 Dec 2014:  The study investigator provided the following additional information.  The event onset was (b)(6)
(b) (6)   The patient was on TYSABRl from 03 Sep 2010 to 02 Oct 2014.  Additional treatment for the event 
included mefloquine.  The MRI that prompted suspicion of PML was done on (b) (6)

Update 18 Dec 2014:  Biogen Idec considers this case to be confirmed for PML based on clinical presentation, 
positive CSF, and radiologic evidence.
Update 13 Jan 2015:  New information provided by the neurologist. The patient has worsened; she is currently 
admitted in the hospital with respiratory failure. The last dose of cidofovir was not administered because the patient 
has difficulty swallowing.
Update 31 Mar 2015: Additional information was received from a neurologist via a MS Standardized PML Data 
Collection Tool. In Aug 2014, while on TYSABRI prior to PML diagnosis, the patient's estimated Karnofsky score 
was 80 (normal activity with effort; some signs or symptoms of disease). At the time of PML diagnosis (date 
unspecified), the patient's height and weight were 170 cm and 50 kg, respectively. On 26 Mar 2015, the patient's 
estimated Karnofsky score was 40 (disabled; requires special care and assistance). No additional lumbar punctures
have been performed. The patient has not been diagnosed with IRIS. Currently, the patient is alive and is residing 
at home. As of 26 Mar 2015, the patient had not recovered from PML. Causality for the event of PML was assessed
as related to TYSABRI.
Update 09 Jun 2015: Additional information was received from a neurologist via a MS Standardized PML Data 
Collection Tool. On 04 Jun 2015, the patient's estimated Karnofsky score and estimated EDSS score were 40 
(disabled; requires special care and assistance) and 8.0, respectively. The most recent brain MRI was done on 21 
May 2015: the examination was compared with the previous one in Feb 2015 and moderate progression was 
observed in the alteration of the signal in relation to the lesions secondary to PML, which affect the subcortical and 
deep white matter of the right frontal convexity with greater involvement in the right periventricular white 
matter.There is also progression of the lesions in both the subcortical and deep white matter of the inferior frontal 
gyrus, corona radiata and pre- and postcentral gyri on the right side. The compromised area of the right thalamus 
remains unchanged. Demyelinating lesions located in the right frontal periventricular and left frontoparietal white 
matter, and the lesions in the semioval centres on the left side remain unchanged. The compromised area 
secondary to PML that affect the subcortical white matter, extending to the deep white matter in the superior area of
the left precentral gyrus remain unchanged. The rest of the examination was unremarkable. The patient has not 
been diagnosed with IRIS. Currently, the patient is alive, residing at home, and is not currently on another therapy 
for MS. As of 04 Jun 2015, the patient had not recovered from PML. Causality for the event of PML was assessed 
as related to TYSABRI.
Update 02 Sep 2015:  New information provided by the neurologist. The patient will be admitted at the hospital on 
(b) (6)  because a LP will be performed. The CSF sample will be sent to (b) (6)  to detect the 
presence of JCV DNA. The patient is clinically stable.

Update 24 Sep 2015:  New information provided by the neurologist. The result of the PCR to detect the presence of
JCV DNA in CSF performed at (b) (6)  laboratory was negative. A control MRI was performed (date unspecified) 
and it was negative for PML. The patient is much better and can be considered recovered.
