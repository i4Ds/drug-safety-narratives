The subject enrolled in (b) (6)  and received his first dose of natalizumab (300mg intravenous monthly) on 28 
March 2007. At the time of the event, 27 April 2013, the subject had received a total of 72 doses, with the last dose 
on 25 March 2013.
The subject had two generalized tonic clonic seizures on(b) (6)  and was hospitalized on (b) (6)  On 
(b) (6)  a brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan with contrast revealed the subject had developed a 
new subcortical left frontal lesion that showed no enhancement. On (b) (6)  a lumbar puncture was 
performed and cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) sample was sent to (b) (6)  on (b) (6)  for JCV DNA testing ? 
results were pending. CSF analysis was performed and was reported to be normal.
A neurological examination performed on (b) (6)  revealed an expanded disability status scale score (EDSS) 
of 7.5. The subject was started on carbamazepine 400mg/day since (b) (6)  and has not had any new seizure 
or new symptoms. He had two sessions of plasmapheresis on (b) (6)  and (b) (6) 3. His clinical feature was 
getting better. 
At the time of this report the event of possible PML was considered ongoing.
The study drug was stopped on (b) (6)  at the last most recent visit. 
The investigator considered the event of possible PML related to suspect drug.
Additional information was expected.
Update 08May 2013: CSF JVC DNA results returned negative from (b) (6)  diagnostic.
Update 16 and 17 May 2013: Additional information received from the investigator reported that the event term at 
the time of this report remained unchanged as possible PML. The subject was first diagnosed with multiple 
sclerosis in 1998 and had no medical history other than urinary tract infection and anti-JCV positive. The subject 
had no history of seizures and there was no family history of seizures. Concomitant medication included 
ciprofloxacin for suspected urinary infection. According to the informal discharge notes, the subject had attended a 
regular MRI on 26 April 2013. He had no complaints and the clinical picture was stable. On(b) (6)  at 5.00 
pm, the subject experienced his first generalized tonic clonic seizure. The subject?s wife reported that the seizure 
had lasted for approximately 60 seconds. He was transferred to a local hospital. Two hours post transfer to the 
local hospital the investigator spoke to the treating neurologist there. It was reported that the subject?s vital signs 
were normal.  He probably had post-ictal confusion. Weakness in both legs was noted. There were no meningeal 
signs. Five to six hours later the subject experienced his second seizure which lasted for about 60 seconds. The

subject awoke 25-30 minutes later. The subject was started on an antiepileptic agent.
On the night of (b) (6)  the subject underwent a brain MRI with and without gadolinium-diethylene- triamine 
penta-acetic acid (Gd-DTPA). Only old signs of MS on contrast enhancement were noted. He was discharged from 
the local hospital on (b) (6) . On(b) (6)  the investigator examined the subject. He was alert and 
oriented and had some history of memory defects lasting for days/months. Paraparesis was noted. The subject?s 
EDSS score had increased slightly to 7.5. The subject was hospitalized on (b) (6)  The subject?s treatment 
for the event included carbamazepine and three courses of plasma exchange (PLEX) on (b) (b) (b) (6)(6)  (6)  and
The subject returned to his usual neurological status EDSS score 6.5, his minimental testing score was 32.
An electrocephalogram (ECG) performed on (b) (6)  showed severe, disseminated disorganization mainly on 
both frontal regions. Frontal intermittent rhythmic delta activity (FIRDA) was suspected on the left frontal lobe. RNA,
plasma, serum and urine samples were obtained on(b) (6)  (results pending). The subject was discharged on
(b) (6)  his health was noted as well. The investigator confirmed that the study drug was temporarily 
discontinued. The rationale for the relationship to the study drug was not clarified.
Additional information was expected.
Update 24 and 28 May 2013: Additional information received from the investigator reported that the event term was 
confirmed as PML.
The investigator confirmed that the subject had experienced his first seizure at home on (b) (6)  and the 
second on the same day at the hospital. A third seizure occurred at home on 26 May 2013. Before the seizures, the
subject had been able to walk 500m with a walker; after the seizures he became wheelchair bound.  The study drug
was permanently discontinued.
A lumbar puncture performed on (b) (6)  showed the CSF was clear, pressure was normal, there were 3 
lymphocytes/cubic mm, protein 27mg/dL. The Pandy reaction was negative, glucose 60mg/dL. On (b) (6)
CSF sample was sent to the(b) (6)  lab, the result was confirmed as JCV DNA negative on (b) (6) . A 
reevaluation of the MRI performed on (b) (6)  indicated a suspected new left frontal lesion without contrast 
enhancement. The subject underwent a further MRI which confirmed this finding, Routine blood tests and urine 
analysis performed on admission were normal. RNA, plasma, serum and urine samples were from (b) (6)
(sent on (b) (6) ) were pending. A CSF sample sent on (b) (6)  to (b) (6)  was confirmed as JCV DNA 
positive on 23 May 2013. A new MRI was arranged for re-evaluating the left front lesion and the possibility of IRIS.
On 24 May 2013, the investigator discussed the health of the subject with himself and his relatives and all was well

at that time. On (b) (6)  (5.45p.m) the relatives called and reported a new seizure had started with deviation of
the head and eyes to the right for 40 seconds. The subject was re-admitted to hospital (Neurology Emergency Unit 
at 6.10p.m). On admission the subject?s vital signs were normal. Neurological examination was the same except 
for confusion (possibly post-ictal). The subject remained under observation in the emergency unit ((b) (6)
03.45 a.m). Additional information was expected.
Upon internal review, Biogen Idec considers this case to be confirmed for PML based on the positive CSF, MRI 
findings, and clinical symptoms.
Update 30 May 2013: Additional information received from the investigator who provided the (b) (6)  CSF report. One 
CSF aliquot tested positive at 38 copies/ml and a second CSF aliquot tested positive at 67 copies/ml. The JCV was 
identified as a virulent variant. 
Additional information was expected.
Update 20 August 2013: Additional information received from the investigator reported that the results of testing of 
plasma, serum and urine samples obtained on (b) (6)  were not yet available. The subject was observed at 
the emergency unit between (b)  and (b) (6)(6)  and a discharge summary was not available. On 
(b) (6)
the subject underwent an EEG which showed (frontal intermittent rhythmic delta activity (FIRDA). The subject?s 
clinical course during readmission included generalized tonic clonic seizures while under antiepileptic treatment. 
The dosage of carbamazepine was increased to 1600 mg per day. On (b) (6)  the subject underwent a brain 
MRI scan. Compared to an MRI performed on (b) (6)  several T2-hyperintense lesions consistent with 
demyelinating plaques and areas without contrast enhancement were observed to the left of the medulla oblongata 
at the level of the brachium pontis. The third and lateral ventricles showed atrophic volume increase. Volume loss 
was present at the corpus callosum. Images in the left internal capsule posterior limb, periventricular white matter 
areas, corona radiate and centrum semiovale extending to the subcortical white matter areas, showing widespread 
confluence consistent with demyelinating plaque. A lesion area was observed in the left frontal lobe, extending from
the subcortical white matter to the left lateral ventricle adjacent to the corpus, hypointense on T1-weighted series, 
hypointense in large part and clearly hyperintense on FLAIR-T2 weighted series peripherally, without diffuse 
hyperintensity or contrast uptake following the contrast injection on T2-weighted series, and thought to be 
significant in terms of progressive PML. The anterior-posterior size of this area was 4.5 cm and the medial-lateral 
size was 3 cm. When compared with the FLAIR T2 sequence of the subject dated (b) (6)  progression was 
observed in the lesion area. Demyelinating plaques were observed not to differ in number and size. However a 
slight increase was observed in the inflammatory area volume, thought to indicate PML. On 05 July 2013 a second 
lumbar puncture was performed and urine and blood samples were obtained and sent for testing (results pending). 
On 15 July 2013 the subject underwent a brain MRI scan. Compared to prior examinations from 29 April 2013 and

03 June 2013, the areas that showed signal intensity change in the left frontal lobe consistent with PML exhibited 
more volume increase and the anterior-posterior size was up to 7 cm and the right-left size was up to 3 cm. An 
increase was present in the dimensions of the area thought to indicate PML. Demyelinating plaques observed in 
other areas were found not to show a significant difference compared to the previous MRI examinations. The 
investigator confirmed that CT reports from baseline, during the event and after the event were not available. At the
time of the report the event of PML was considered ongoing.
Additional information was expected.
Update 26 November 2013: Additional information was received from the investigator via an MS Standardized PML 
Data Collection Tool. The subject is alive, residing at home, and is not currently on any MS therapy. The 
investigator reported that upon examination in early May 2013, the subject developed sub-acute right hemiparesis 
and dysphasia. He was wheelchair-bound and needed special care for eating, writing, bathing, and all aspects of 
self-care. His wife assisted him at home. Upon examination on 05 October 2013, he had improved. His 
comprehension and expression were good and he easily continued the conversation fluently. He could write, read, 
eat alone, and go to the bathroom with little assistance from the walls. His neurological function is at 80% and is at 
baseline before PML. He wants to use new MS therapy. The subject has not been diagnosed with IRIS and did not 
receive corticosteroids. The investigator assessed the subject?s estimated Karnofsky and EDSS scores on 05 
October 2013 to be 50 (requires considerable assistance and frequent medical care) and 7.0. On 05 October 2013,
the subject underwent a lumbar puncture with results reported as negative for CSF JCV DNA ((b) (6) ). The 
investigator plans to send the CSF sample obtained on this date to (b) (6)  After this result has been received, the 
investigator plans to start the subject on Tecfidera. CD4 results post-PML have not yet arrived. On 05 July 2013, 
the subject underwent a lumbar puncture (results not reported). The subject has recovered from PML. Causality for 
the event was assessed as related to TYSABRI.  At the time of this report, the investigator considered the event of 
PML as resolved on 05 October 2013.
Additional information was expected.
Upon clarification on 05 Dec 2013, it was determined that the previous Update 26 November 2013 (follow-up via an
MS Standardized PML Data Collection Tool) was actually received on 21 November 2013 . Additional information 
was expected.
Update 18 March 2014: Additional information received from the investigator reported that on CSF collected on 03 
October 2013 had 34 copies/ml of JCV DNA, consistent with variant most commonly associated with PML 
(reference range, equal to or greater than 10 copies/ml).

Plasma collected on 03 October 2013 had 71, 44, 81 and 40 copies/ml of JCV DNA, consistent with variant most 
commonly associated with PML.  Serum collected on 03 October 2013 had 70, 39, 54 and 34 copies/ml of JCV 
DNA, consistent with variant most commonly associated with PML.  Urine collected on 03 October 2013 had 26599,
30840, 33217 and 38098 copies/ml of JCV DNA, consistent with variant most commonly associated with PML and 
urine. Additional information was expected.
Update 27 June 2014: Additional information was received from the investigator via a MS Standardized PML Data 
Collection Tool and diagnostic report. The subject's EDSS score was 6.5 on 04 May 2014. The subject is alive, 
residing at home, and is not currently on any MS therapy. The patient has recovered from PML. Causality for the 
event was assessed as related to TYSABRI.
Update 14 May 2015: Additional information was received from the investigator via a MS Standardized PML Data 
Collection Tool. The subject's most recent brain MRI was in October 2013, no details were provided. The subject's 
Karnofsky score and EDSS score on 17 April 2015 were 60 (requires occasional assistance, but is able to care for 
most of his personal needs) and 6.5. The subject is alive, residing at home, and is not currently on any MS therapy. 
As of 17 April 2015, the subject was assessed as recovered from PML. Causality for the event was assessed as 
related to TYSABRI.
