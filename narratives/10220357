A neurologist reported that a 33 year old female patient on TYSABRI (300 mg, IV, QM) for Multiple Sclerosis from 
Apr 2011 to Apr 2014 was hospitalized from an unknown date to an unknown date for PML suspicion (onset 2014). 
The patient received a total of 36 infusions at the time of this report. Medical history was significant for previous 
immunosuppressant use with mitozantrone and positive JCV antibodies on an unknown date.  Brain MRI in Mar 
2014 showed an inconspicuous lesion.  Brain MRI on 16 May 2014 showed a small confluent lesion in the left 
frontal lobe, not Gadolinium enhancing, visible on diffusion and FLAIR, which was supect for PML. Furthermore, the
patient presented for two months with gradual onset of right hemiparesis affecting the right side of the body and 
associated with dysarthria. Lumbar puncture was performed on 19 May 2014 and CSF samples were sent to 
(b) (6)  lab for JCV DNA testing; results pending.  The outcome for the event PML suspicion is unknown. The 
causality for the event of PML suspicion is unknown.  TYSABRI therapy was discontinued.  French Imputability:

FOIA Case Report Information
Update 11 Jun 2014: Additional information was received from the affiliate. The neurologist did not send the [CSF] 
samples to (b) (6)  but directly to (b) (6)  result is negative. PML suspicion remains high.  A new control MRI is 
planned in 2 weeks and a biopsy will be planned if a lesion is highly suspicious. At the time of this report, the patient
is clinically stable with cerebellar syndrome and right brachio-facial ataxia and paresis.  The patient was discharged 
from the hospital on an unknown date and is currently in rehabilitation. French Imputability C2S1I1.
Update 11 Jul 2014: Additional information was received from the neurologist.  The PML was confirmed on biopsy 
(NOS). JCV PCR testing in CSF was negative. TYSABRI was discontinued on 11 Apr 2014. The patient received 
36 infusions in total.  French Imputability: C2S2I2
Update 16 Jul 2014: The neurologist reported additional information regarding the biopsy performed on 09 Jul 
2014.  On microscopic exam, 10 small fragments were observed about 2 mm. Infiltration of cerebral tissue was 
observed as evidenced by numerous inflammatory, essentially lymphocytic cells, net enhancement around vascular
structures, forming thick prevascular sleeves. There was no vascular wall destruction. Neurons were observed with 
ischemic signs, round cells with large nuclei and low lacquered, what may correspond to viral affect on morphologic
cells.  On immunologic and histochemical exam, these cells are positive with antiSV40 and antiMIB1 antibodies. 
Inflammatory infiltrate in mainly marked with anti lymphocytes T CD3 antibodies, less with anti lymphocytes B CD20
antibodies. Anti-CMV antibodies were negative. Anti CD68 antibodies showed associated macrophagic infiltration. 
Anti CD4 antibodies were difficult to analyze because of important positivity and intensive background noise. Anti 
CD8 antibodies were present in approximately 50% of lymphocytes. Anti-granzyme B antibodies were observed in 
rare marked cells. Perls coloration did not showed iron overload. The conclusion was PML with associated 
important Inflammatory infiltrate, suggesting IRIS.
Update 17 Jul 2014: A regulatory agency, ANSM via CRPV of Toulouse (ref number TO20141015) provided 
information regarding this case.  The patient has been diagnosed with RRMS since 2001. Presumed medical 
history included gastroduodenal catheter, tobacco and cannabis intoxication (presumed use of), alcohol 
intoxication, weaned since Apr2014. TYSABRI therapy was given from Aug 2010 (date discrepant) to 11 Apr 2014. 
Concomitant medication included Ceris (Trospium Chloride). Beginning in Feb 2014, the patient experienced 
fluctuant, then permanent right motor hemicorporal difficulties with upper limb dysmetria and sensitive disorders.
On 26 Feb 2014, brain MRI showed no PML suspect lesions.  The patient received steroid therapy, IV, for 3 days.
On 10 Apr 2014, the patient received her 36th TYSABRI infusion.  On 15 May 2014, the next infusion was planned 
but not performed as the patient presented with cerebellar syndrome, sensitivomotor deficit of upper right limb, and 
anti-JCV antibodies positive with index value of 2.9.  The patient was hospitalized from (b) (6)  to (b) (6)  
(b) (6)  in the neurology department.  Brain MRI showed PML suspect lesions, evolving slowly.  JCV intrathecal 
antibodies negative (presumed CSF JCV PCR).  Discharge medications included tardyferon, Ceris (trospium 
chloride), Dolipran (paracetamol), and lacrifluid carbomere 980.  From (b) (6)  to 06 Jun 2014, the patient

was in rehabilitation department for right hemiparesis and cerebellar syndrome - kynesi and ergo therapies.  At 
discharge on 06 Jun 2014, the patient was provided the same treatment and sagulax and eductil.  On (b) (6)
the patient was hospitalized in the neurology department and Copaxone (glatiramer acetate) was started.  On the 
same day, brain MRI showed numerous Gadolinium enhancing lesions, left frontal lesion extension (noted to be not
typical PML, but compatible to PML). Diagnosis of PML confirmed on biopsy (previously reported). French 
Imputability C2S2I2.
Update 17 Jul 2014: Biogen Idec considers this case confirmed for PML based on brain biopsy, MRI findings, and 
clinical symptoms.
Update 11 Sep 2014: Additional information received from the French Health Authorities (reference TO20141015). 
The 33-year-old female patient went into consultation on 28 Aug 2014. The patient presented abnormal movement 
of the mouth after the introduction of Norset (mirtazapine). She followed a re-education with accompanying 
physiotherapy, ergotherapy and orthophony. The patient returned home with a medical management on day care. 
Brain MRI (date unspecified) found a slight increase of left precentral and parietal abnormalities of FLAIR signal 
(related to the PML) and overall stability of the lesion load without signs of activity. Finally, favorable clinical 
outcome after rehabilitation in a patient followed for relapsing-remitting MS, treated with TYSABRI and associated 
with PML. Maraviroc 300mg on the morning and on the evening was introduced as corrective treatment. MRI was 
stable. Outcome of the patient for PML was switched from unknown to recovering (presume not yet recovered).
Update 07 Oct 2014: Additional information was received, via a Biogen Idec Account Business Manager and 
Medical Science Liaison, from a dissertation: Grosset-Janin C. A retrospective study of 13 patients who developed 
progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy under natalizumab: clinical and radiological. The dissertation was 
presented at University of Toulouse, France, on 02 Oct 2014. The author presented 13 cases of PML from two 
university hospitals. The diagnosis of PML was made or suspected between Dec 2009 and Jun 2014. Patient 
information was collected from medical records that were reviewed retrospectively from the hospital databases. 
Patient # (b)(6)  refers to case MCN # 2014BI051178. The female patient was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis in 
2001 at the age of 21. At the time of PML diagnosis, the patient was 34 year old (discrepant information) and MS 
was evolving for 13 years. TYSABRI was started 10 years after MS was diagnosed and was ongoing at the time of 
PML. The patient had received 36 infusions.  The neurologist assessed the event of PML as confirmed. JCV PCR 
in CSF was negative, however biopsy was positive. JCV serology was positive. The patient had received 
mitoxantrone, immunosuppressive agent, before TYSABRI and had 3 risk factors for the event. French Imputability:

performed on 27 Jun 2014, which was positive for JCV DNA. The following lab results were obtained on 26 Jun 
2014 at the time of PML diagnosis: absolute leukocyte count 5.96 G/L; lymphocyte count 36.7%; absolute 
lymphocyte count 2.2 G/L; hemoglobin 12.2 g/dl. The patient had a negative HIV result on 03 Oct 2014. She had a 
positive serology test for Epstein Barr Virus VCA Ig G and EBNA Ig G but negative test for Epstein Barr Virus IgM 
VCA on 03 Oct 2014. She was diagnosed with IRIS, which was determined by MRI findings. Prior to IRIS onset, 
she received methylprednisolone 1 G daily from 03 Mar to 05 Mar 2014 and from 12 Mar 2014 to 13 Mar 2014. She
has received maraviroc 300 mg twice daily since 28 Aug 2014. She did not receive corticosteroids post-IRIS onset. 
Currently, the patient is alive and is residing at home. She has recovered from PML and has recovered from IRIS. 
Causality for the events of PML and IRIS was assessed as related to TYSABRI.

 15 Jan 2015; published online:  1-5.  This case refers to patient 2; 33 year old female patient with a past medical 
history of RR-MS on beta-interferon therapy from 2002 to 2010 and natalizumab since 2010.  In May 2014, after 36 
infusions of natalizumab, the patient presented with PML characterized by fatigue, progressive right hemiparesis, 
and gait walk ataxia.  The patient's brain MRI at presentation showed T2 and FLAIR white matter hyperintensity 
with T1 hpyointensity associated with contrast enhancement in the left perirolandic area suggestive of PML.  Biopsy
of the left perirolandic lesion showed demyelinated lesions, JCV infected oligodendrocyte s (9.1 and 5.5/mm2 
respectively) and a parenchymal immune cell infiltration mainly composed of CD8+ T cells; CD68+ 
macrophagic/microglial cells (1,480/mm2), CD20+ B cells (55/mm2) and CD138+ plasma cells (241/mm2) were 
also present in the biopsied lesion.  The patient was assessed as having inflammatory PML and at risk for PML-
IRIS.  Treatment included discontinuation of natalizumab, MS therapy with a copolymer acetate, maraviroc, and six 
sessions of plasmapheresis.  The patient did not receive steroids.  At 20 weeks post maraviroc treatment initiation 
the right hemiparesis markedly improved, and repeated MRI showed a stability of lesion volume and a decrease in 
contrast enhancement.
