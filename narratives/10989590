Medically Significant
A registered nurse spontaneously reported, via a (b) (6)  CSF JCV PCR testing request, that a 37 year 
old male patient on TYSABRI (unknown dose, unknown route, unknown frequency) for an unknown indication from 
unknown date to unknown date experienced suspect PML (onset 05 Jan 2015). CSF sample was collected on 05 
Jan 2015 and CSF JCV DNA ((b) (6) ) results are pending. Treatment for the event was not provided. The outcome 
for the event suspect PML is unknown. The causality for the event of suspect PML is unknown.  It is unknown if 
TYSABRI treatment is ongoing.
Update 08 Jan 2015: Upon follow-up, a registered nurse reported that the male patient on TYSABRI (unknown 
dose, IV, Q4 weeks) from Jun 2010 to Nov 2014 has highly active RRMS. The patient had received 42 doses. The 
nurse reported that the patient had been doing very well on TYSABRI. The patient's MS was stable and he had no 
relapses since starting treatment. Testing included and MRI scan in May 2014, which showed no changes. The 
patient was anti-JCV antibody positive (date unknown) and his index level was very high - 4.4. Since the patient had
a high index value "they" were in the process of stopping treatment with TYSABRI and the patient had been brought
in to have an exit scan and a review to discuss options. A large lesion was detected on the MRI (Nov 2014), 
present in the dorsal pons (right hand side) - size not determined. The lesion was new and described as an area of 
high signal intensity. The patient has an EDSS score (date unknown) of 1-1.5 and is very stable. A sample of CSF 
was sent off for testing at (b) (6)  (presumed reference to 05 Jan 2015 CSF sample). At this stage, the reporter does
not think this is a case of PML. TYSABRI therapy was discontinued in Nov 2014.
Update 16 Jan 2015: A registered nurse spontaneously reported that the male patient tested negative for CSF JCV 
DNA ((b) (6) ). At the time of this report, the working diagnosis was an asymptomatic lesion on MRI. The nurse 
reported that the patient is likely to re-start TYSABRI. No further information was provided.
19 Jan 2015: A report was received from the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) 
(registry number: ADR 22833106-001). This report corresponds to case # 2015BI001862, was in the form of an 
anonymized single patient report of a 37 year old male patient, and contained no new information.
Update 12 Feb 2015: Follow-up information received from the nurse reported that the patient was doing very well 
and was re-started on TYSABRI.
Update 19 Feb 2015: Biogen Idec considers this case ruled out for PML based on negative CSF negative MRI, MD 
rule out and final diagnosis of asymptomatic lesion on MRI.
Update 23 Mar 2015: Follow-up information received from the physician indicated that a CSF sample was sent for

JCV DNA PCR testing on 20 Mar 2015.  No further information was available.
Update 24 Mar 2015: Follow-up information received from the physician indicated that the patient underwent MRI 
which "looks like PML." CSF test results were still pending.
Update 30 Mar 2015: Follow-up information received from the physician indicated that the CSF JCV DNA results 
were positive ((b) (6)  laboratory). The physician indicated that the patient had previously been tested for CSF JCV 
DNA in Nov 2014 and the result was negative. The patient wanted to go back on TYSABRI. The last infusion had 
been in Dec [2014] (previously reported as Nov 2014) and TYSABRI was stopped in Jan, Feb, and Mar 2015 as the
physician had suspicion of PML. During that time, the patient received monthly steroids. 
Update 31 Mar 2015:Follow-up information received from the physician indicated that the patient was clinically 
stable. In Nov 2014, a new lesion was seen on MRI and the patient had a high anti JCV antibody index. The patient 
received about 48 infusion [of TYSABRI] in total. 
Update 02 Apr 2015: Follow-up information was received from the physician. The patient's initials and date of birth 
were confirmed. MS was diagnosed in 2007. The patient received IFN (interferon) from 2007 to 2009 and TYSABRI
from Nov 2010 to Dec 2014 for a total of 44 infusions. JCV antibody was tested in Nov 2014 with an index of 4.4. 
EDSS pre-TYSABRI was 3.0, and when TYSABRI was stopped (NOS) was 1.5. On Nov 2014 the patient 
underwent MRI which prompted PML suspicion, the impression was "atypical brainstem lesion" and the patient was 
asymptomatic. The patient underwent lumbar puncture on 20 Mar 2015 for JCV DNA PCR for suspected PML and 
the result was positive. The patient was treated with IV steroids (NOS) and the final diagnosis was considered PML.
 Additionally in Feb 2015 the patient experienced fatigue, depression, and loss of libido; no further information was 
provided regarding these events.
Update 16 Apr 2015: Biogen considers this case confirmed for PML based on positive CSF and consistent MRI 
findings; asymptomatic case.
Update 28 Sep 2015: Additional information was received from the following abstract presentation: Nicholas R, 
Raffel J, Malik O. Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy presenting with posterior fossa radiological features 
in the context of natalizumab therapy in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis. Presentation presented at 31st 
Congress of the European Committee for Treatment and Research in Multiple Sclerosis (ECTRIMS); 06Oct2015; 
Barcelona, Spain. The abstract stated that, a 38 year old male who had received 48 infusions (discrepant 
information) of NTL (TYSABRI) had an EDSS of 1.5 and a high JCV index. He presented with a new brainstem 
lesion on routine scanning. Neuroradiology review felt this was an MS lesion. NTL was stopped and an LP was 
normal. Three months later repeat imaging showed a further enhancing lesion in the brainstem and new

characteristic PML changes in the left frontal lobe. Repeat LP showed 350 copies of JCV.
Update 02 Oct 2015: Additional information was received from the physician via a MS Standardized PML Data 
Collection Tool. The patient is alive, residing at home, and is not currently on another therapy for MS. The patient 
was diagnosed with IRIS (onset 08 May 2015) which was determined by MRI findings and the following clinical 
symptoms: cognitive / behavioral; motor - decreased mobility, ataxia, weakness in lower extremities; speech - 
slurred speech; cerebellar - concentration is poor, not able to focus; and sensory - numbness of lower extremities. 
The symptoms were observed on 08 May 2015.   The patient did receive corticosteroids post-IRIS. Treatment for 
IRIS included: methylprednisolone (1 g, IV, daily for five days) from 05 Jan 2015 to 09 Jan 2015, 
methylprednisolone (2 g, IV, one day) from 12 Feb 2015 to 12 Feb 2015, methylprednisolone (1 g, IV, daily for five 
days) from 20 Mar 2015 to 24 Mar 2015, and prednisolone (60 mg reducing dose, PO, unknown frequency) from 25
Mar 2015 to 30 Apr 2015. Abnormal laboratory test results included: 09 May 2015 - WBC of 14.9, hematocrit of 
0.371, mean cell hemoglobin of 356, neutrophil count of 12.8, lymphocyte count of 0.9, monocyte count of 1.2, 
APTT of 20.5, total bilirubin level of 29, and magnesium level of 1.06; 10 May 2015 -  WBC of 11.9, RBC of 4.17, 
hemoglobin of 127, hematocrit level of 0.365, neutrophil count of 10.3, lymphocyte count 0.7, monocyte count of 
1.0, APTT of 20.7, urea level of 8.0, alk phos level of 25, total protein level of 58, albumin level of 33,and total 
bilirubin level of 26; 11 May 2015 - hemoglobin of 128, hematocrit 0.375, neutrophil count of 8.5, lymphocyte count 
of 1.0, APTT of 19.6, ALK phos level of 23, total protein level of 58, and albumin level of 33; 12 May 2015 - WBC of 
11.1, neutrophil count of 9.5, lymphocyte count of 0.8, albumin level of 34, and magnesium level of 1.02; and 13 
May 2015 - neutrophil count of 8.9, alanine aminotransferase level of 103, and albumin level of 34. An MRI was 
performed on 17 Jun 2015, results not provided. The most recent brain MRI was performed on 20 Jul 2015 with the
following results: comparison was made with previous MRI study of 17 Jun 2015. There has been a reduction in 
peripheral enhancement of the bifrontal white matter abnormality. The widespread patchy predominately juxta and 
subcortical white matter signal changes throughout both cerebral hemispheres are again noted but there does 
appear to be slightly less involvement of the right thalamo-capsular region, and perhaps a slight reduction of many 
of the other sites of disease. The patient was assessed on 17 Sep 2015 as recovered from PML and as recovered 
from IRIS. Causality for the events of PML and IRIS was assessed as related to TYSABRI. The patient's estimated 
Karnofsky score was assessed on 25 Sep 2015 as 80 and EDSS score on 26 Sep 2015 was 5.5.
Update 21 Oct 2015: Additional information was received from a literature. Raffel J, Gafson A, Malik O, and

Update 06 Nov 2015: Additional information was received from the physician. The patient's medical history included
brown-sequard syndrome, sensory disturbance in lower limb, diplopia, ataxia, bladder issues, and migraines. A MRI
on an unknown date showed lesions consistent with demyelination. CSF was positive for oligoclonal bands (OCB) 
on an unknown date. The patient was reported to have previously received AVONEX and had an EDSS of 2.5 on 
an unknown date. Regarding the patient's history of MS, the patient had no relapses for twelve months and then 
had two relapses in 2006 and two more in Nov 2008. New lesions were seen on an MRI since 2005 and the 
patient's EDSS was 4.5 on an unknown date. TYSABRI therapy was then initiated and the patient's EDSS was 
noted to have improved to 3.0 over two years and MRI was noted to be stable on an unknown date. Then, the 
patient's EDSS worsened slowly to 6.0 over four years and in Apr 2014 EDSS was 6.5. In Jun 2014, the patient 
experienced a brainstem relapse (presumed MS) (onset Jun 2014), received intravenous methylprednisolone 
(IVMP) and showed some improvement. In Aug 2014, the patient had another brainstem relapse. TYSABRI therapy
was discontinued and alemtuzumab was considered. The patient began receiving monthly IVMP. A repeat MRI was
performed in Oct 2014 for which the image was provided. The impression of the MRI was not provided. In Nov 
2014, a lumbar puncture was performed which showed 3800 copies of JCV DNA. The patient was considered 
stable with an EDSS of 6.5. The outcome of the event of brainstem relapse (presumed MS) is unknown and 
causality was not assessed.
