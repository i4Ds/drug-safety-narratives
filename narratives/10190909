AER 1404904 is a non interventional study literature summary case, received on 19/May/2014 and concerns a 
group of patient (7 male elderly patients) some of whom (6 patients) died of Progressive multifocal 
leukoencephalopathy (PML) while treated with rituximab while enrolled in a study.
Using electronic medical records from the Veteran's Administration (VA); ICD-9 codes were used to identify 
patients diagnosed with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), PML, and HIV within the VA from 2003 to 2011. 
Pharmacy records were used to identify patients receiving rituximab, cyclophosphamide, hydroxydaunorubicin, and 
vincristine. This project was conducted inside the Veterans Affairs Informatics and Computing Infrastructure after 
obtaining approvals from the VA IRB and other oversight groups. Fifty seven thousand and forty one non-HIV NHL 
patients were identified. A total of 14/57,041 (0.025%) patients had developed PML; 7/8,895 (7.8 per 10,000) NHL 
patients who received rituximab subsequently developed PML while 7/48,146 (1.5 per 10,000) NHL patients who 
did not receive rituximab subsequently developed PML, which results in a statistically significant unadjusted relative
risk of 5.4 (95% CI: 1.9 - 15.4). The rituximab patients mean age at PML diagnosis was 65.5 years and the mean

time to their PML diagnosis from their  first rituximab dose (sd) was 14.9 months.
The authors concluded that among lymphoma patients, the use of rituximab is associated with a statistically 
significant relative risk for documented PML of 5.4. Measurement of JC virus prior to initiation of rituximab therapy 
as well as during rituximab therapy should be considered.
