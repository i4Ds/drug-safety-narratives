Medically Significant
Autonomous Community: CASTILLA-LA MANCHA
A physician spontaneously reported that a female patient (age unspecified) receiving TYSABRI (300 mg, IV, QM) 
from an unknown date experienced a suspicion of PML. Indication for TYSABRI was multiple sclerosis (MS), 
diagnosed on an unreported date. No medical history or concomitant medications were reported. 
The physician informed that the patient was treated with TYSABRI for 5 years. Four months ago the STRATIFY test
was performed to detect anti-JCV antibodies and the result was positive. Because of this result the patient stopped 
treatment with TYSABRI. On 10 May 2013 the patient started treatment with Fingolimod. The patient is clinically 
worse; she stopped walking and has emotional disorders. An MRI was performed, and it shows images suspicious

of PML. On May 15, 2013 a lumbar puncture will be performed and the CSF will be sent to the (b) (6)  Lab to detect 
JCV by PCR. 
The physician assessed the suspicion of PML to be related to TYSABRI. At the time of this report, the outcome of 
the suspicion of PML was not yet recovered. TYSABRI was discontinued 4 months ago.
Update 17 May 2013: The neurologist provided additional information reporting the patient started treatment with 
TYSABRI from Dec 2007 until Oct 2012. The patient was diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis in 2002. Previous 
therapies included interferon beta-1a and glatiramer acetate. The patient had experienced an MS relapse (onset 
Jan 2011); no further details regarding this event were provided. The suspicious PML symptoms began a week 
ago. Additional information is expected. 
Update 24 May 2013: Follow-up was provided that included 3 CDs with images for 13 May 2013, 27 Mar 2013, and 
20 Jul 2012. This case is now assessed as high suspect for PML based on internal review of MRI images received 
on 24May2013, as the Mar 2013 MRI is suspicious for PML.
Update 28 May 2013:  The neurologist spontaneously provided additional follow-up to report the patient remains 
clinically stable with slight improvement. The lesions in the MRI have improved due to the treatment with 
corticosteroids. Treatment with Gilenya has yet to be resumed. 
Update 28 May 2013: Follow-up was provided by (b) (6)  to report the result of the PCR performed at 
(b) (6)  to detect the JCV in CSF was negative. 
Update 03 Jun 2013: Follow-up was provided to report an extra CSF sample will be sent to (b) (6)  Lab to detect 
JCV by PCR on 05 Jun 2013.
Update 05 Jun 2013: New follow-up was provided by the neurologist who spontaneously reported the patient had 
no neurological clinical symptoms in Jul 2012. Suspicion of PML began in Mar 2013 and the patient suffered clinical
deterioration since then. This deterioration was initially interpreted as an MS relapse. From late Oct 2012 to Apr 
2013, when TYSABRI was stopped, only steroids were used when the treatment with Fingolimod (Gilenya) was 
started in Mar 2013.
Update 18 Jun 2013: The neurologist spontaneously reported the result of the PCR to detect JCV in CSF was 
positive, 66 copies/ml were detected.

Update 25 Jun 2013: Biogen Idec considers this case confirmed for PML.
Update 28 Jun 2013: The neurologist provided additional information to spontaneously report the patient had a 
single STRATIFY test done to detect anti-JCV antibodies in Jul or Aug 2012 not in Jan 2013 as previously reported.
TYSABRI treatment was discontinued in Oct 2012 due to the positive result of the STRATIFY test and the risk of 
developing PML. 
Update 27 Aug 2013: New information was provided by the neurologist to report another CSF sample will be sent to
(b) (6)  lab to detect the presence of JCV by PCR. Additional information is expected.
Update 13 Sep 2013: The neurologist reported that 26 copies/mL of JCV DNA were detected at the last PCR 
performed at (b) (6)  lab. The lumbar puncture was performed on 20 Aug 2013. No further information was 
provided.
Update 04 Dec 2013: Additional information was received from the neurologist via a MS Standardized PML Data 
Collection Tool. The patient is alive, residing at home, and is not currently on any MS therapy. The neurologist 
assessed the patient?s current clinical status as having a progressive spastic paraparesis and requires care for all 
daily activities. On an unspecified date, a brain MRI was performed with results reported as new lesions that 
suggest demyelination. The neurologist assessed the patient?s estimated Karnofsky and EDSS scores on 21 Nov 
2013 to be 60 (requires occasional assistance, but is able to care for most of her personal needs) and 6.5. The 
patient underwent a lumbar puncture on 06 Sep 2013 with CSF JCV DNA results reported as positive at 26 copies 
per mL. A lumbar puncture was done on 18 Jun 2013 with CSF JCV DNA results reported as positive at 66 copies 
per mL. The patient has not been diagnosed with IRIS. It is unknown if the patient has recovered from PML. 
Causality for the event was assessed as related to TYSABRI.
Update 31 Jan 2014:  New information provided by the neurologist. The patient is worse, more spastic and with 
more bradypsychia. The patient has a new lesion on the MRI and the neurologist doesnt know if it is due to the MS 
or the PML. The neurologist will send a CSF sample to the (b) (6)  to determine the presence of 
JCV DNA by PCR.
Update 12 Feb 2014: New information provided by the Neurologist. The result of the PCR performed at the 
(b) (6)   to detect JCV in CSF was positive (18 cop/ml). The CSF sample was sent to (b) (6)
(b) (6)  on February  04, 2014.
Update 13 Aug 2014: New information provided by the neurologist. A new CSF sample will be sent to the (b) (6)
(b) (6)  to detect the number of copies of JCV DNA by PCR.

Update 13 Aug 2014: Additional information was received from a neurologist via a MS Standardized PML Data 
Collection Tool. The patient is alive, residing at home, and is not currently on any MS therapy. On an unspecified 
date, the neurologist assessed the patient?s estimated Karnofsky score to be 60 (requires occasional assistance, 
but is able to care for most of her personal needs) On 27 Aug 2014 the neurologist assessed the patient?s 
estimated EDSS score to be 5. The patient has recovered from PML. Causality for the event was assessed as 
related to TYSABRI.
Update 26 Aug 2014: New information provided by the (b) (6)  The sample of CSF was tested 
twice by PCR and both results were negative. No copies of JCV DNA were detected.
