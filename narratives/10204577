Case number PHHY2014FR063886, is a spontaneous combined initial and follow up report received from the 
physician on 23 and 26 May 2014 respectively and further follow up reports received from the physician on 05 Jun 
2014, 22 Jul 2014 and 29 Jul 2014. 
This report refers to a 42 year old female patient. Her prior MS therapies included subcutaneous interferon from 
2002 to 2009 and Tysabri (Natalizumab) from 01 Jan 2009. Her multiple sclerosis was stable while on Tysabri. JCV
serology test was positive (2.842) in Jul 2013.  Tysabri was discontinued on 01 Oct 2013 due to positive JCV 
serology.
The patient began treatment with Gilenya (fingolimod) capsule one dose form daily for relapsing remitting multiple 
sclerosis (RRMS) on 01 Jan 2014. 
On 01 Mar 2014, the patient experienced blurred vision, orbital pain and two tonic clonic seizures which were 
initially led to suspicion of MS relapse. Corrective treatment included one Tysabri infusion. Seizures were treated 
with Keppra (levetiracetam). On 01 Mar 2014, treatment with Gilenya was discontinued 
In Apr 2014, the patient was treated with corticosteroids (unspecified). The patient symptoms temporarily improved 
for a week. On (b) (6)  patient was hospitalized for behaviour disorder, disorientation and apathy. Afterwards 
MRI showed one left sub cortical lesion with gadolinium enhancement and others lesions without gadolinium 
enhancement as well as diffuse hyposignal. The physician reported that PML (Progressive Multifocal 
Leukoencephalopathy) or IRIS was suspected. 
On 05 Jun 2014, JCV PCR (done locally) in CSF was found to be negative. Brain MRI done on 20 Apr 2014 and 01 
May 2014 revealed, lesions of multiple sclerosis more punctiform, enhancing on frontal and parietal areas; non-
enhancing hypersignal T2 lesion of the left insular cortex Suspicion of PML was not confirmed. 
Lumbar puncture was performed again on 13 Jun 2014 and send to(b) (6)  laboratory.  The result was 75 copies/mL, 
consistent with variant most commonly associated with PML. Diagnosis of PML was confirmed. According to

FOIA Case Report Information
treating physician, the seizures which initially led to suspicion of a MS relapse on 01 Mar 2014  is now considered 
as probably the first clinical sign of PML.
In Jul 2014, the patient experienced paraphasia, mood disorder and depression. She recovered from disorientation.
These symptoms could be related to PML but also can be caused by Keppra. No multiple sclerosis relapse was 
observed. It is planned to reintroduce Gilenya after the visit to her neurologist in order to continue the treatment of 
multiple sclerosis.
Outcome of the event seizures, blurred vision and orbital pain was reported as recovered but not reported for PML. 
Outcome of the event aphasia, apathy and behavior disorder was reported as condition unchanged and outcome 
was not reported for other events. 
The physician assessed the seriousness of the event PML as hospitalization and events of seizure, blurred vision 
and orbital pain as non-serious and assessed all the events including PMl to be unlikely related to Gilenya. The 
physician also reported that PML was probably related to Tysabri. No further information was available.
Follow up report received from a physician on 05 Jun 2014: Information related to patient's demography, suspect 
drug (start date, stop date), concomitant medication, events onset date, outcome, seriousness and causality and 
physician comments were updated.
Combined follow up report received from the physician on 22 Jul 2014 and 29 Jul 2014. New events of PML, 
depressive disorder and mood disorder were added. Co suspect (Keppra) and treatment drug were added.
