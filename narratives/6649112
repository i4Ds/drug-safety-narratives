This special surveillance (H3E-JE-AK01, non-interventional study) case, concerns a 77 year old male patient. This 
patient's medical history' pleural mesothelioma malignant (histological diagnosis :epithelioid type, stage lb) 
diagnosed on 18-Mar-2008 with pleural effusion, pleurodesis from 31-Mar-2008 to 11-Apr-2008, asbestosis, 
asbestos exposure, emphysema, diabetes mellitus, alcohol use, and smoker (30 pieces per day for 60 years). He 
received folic acid and vitamin B12 as supplementation, glimepiride, voglibose, oxatomide, bromhexine 
hydrochloride, oxycodone hydrochloride hydrate, magnesium oxide, prochlorperazine, metocloprarnide, 
dexamethasone, ramosetron hydrochloride. At the initiation of protocol on 24-Mar-2008, chest computed 
tomography (CT) showed right pleural effusion, tumor mass in right middle lung lobe and reticular shadow in both 
lower lung fields. On 22-Apr-2008, baseline performance status on the ECOG/Zubrod scale was 1.  The patient 
first and last received pemetrexed disodium (Alimta) 847 mg intravenously (iv.) and cispiatin 127 mg iv for pleural 
mesotheliorna malignant on 24-Apr-2008 during his hospitalization. Due to overload fluid associated with 
chemotherapy and fever (37.2 degrees Celsius), oxygen saturation (Sp02) was slightly decreased ( 94 %). He 
started to receive two liter oxygen per minute via nasal canula beginning On s ,41111 
days after the first dose of study drugs, he experienced renal impairment (prolonged hospitalization) with blood urea 
nitrogen (BUN) 49.2 m9/4:fiend creatin
and Cr 2.70 mg/dl. On 1.111111111 ine (Cr) 1.60 mgidl. 0114111101Mr enal function test was BUN 81.9 mg/di due to renal function worsened and fluid retention observed, oxygenation 
level decreased. Oxygen inhalation via nasal increased to four liter per minute temporary. Chest x-ray did not 
know show relevant change. On 1.011111.,indays after the first dose of study drugs, he experienced febrile 
neutropenia and platelets decreased with white blood cell count (WBC) 1700/mid ( sag 90 %) and platelet count 
(Pit) 54 kimict He received filgrastim and pazufloxacin mesilate. On Pit count decreased to 
Cle 06-May-2008, he started to receive meropenern hydrate  fever (38.6 degrees Celsius on11111. 
38.5 degrees Celsius on until 13-May-2008. WBC increased to 5300/micl. FIuk 
retention caused oxy g level decreased, oxygen inhalation increased again. Chest CT did not show 
significant change, however due to blood lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) increased to 588 LEL and fever, the 
laves  '0-    considered interstitial pneumonitis occurred. LDH increased was reported as serious (hospitalization) 
by the r . Dexamethasone sodium phosphate 4 mg intravenously started from 09-May-2008 to 12-May-2008. 
On: days after the first dose of study drugs, liver disorder occurred (prolonged hospitalization) with 
liver function test as follows; alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 19 IU/1, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 37 IU/I, 
blood lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) 1024 Wit_ and total-bilirubin 4.11 mg/di. On IMMO respiratory condition 
worsened and 40 % oxygen inhalation 12 liter per minute started. Chest X-ray showed reticular shadow in both 
lower lung fields and chest CT showed extended ground-glass shadow in both lower lung fields. Plt count 
increased to 11.2 Wink!. On 13-May-2008, although methylprednisolone sodium succinate 1 g was started, 
multiple organ failure and respiratory failure led him to CO2 narcosis. On 11111.11b he died of interstitial 
pneumonitis. The event outcome of renal impairment, liver disorder and LDH increased were not recovered. 
Autopsy information was unknown. Lot/control number information not requested during initial contact; Lot/control 
number not provided. In the opinion of the investigator, interstitial pneumonitis was related to pemetrexed and

asbestosis but unknown to cisplatin. Febrile neutropenia and platelets count decreased were related to both study 
drugs. She did not know the causal relationship between liver disorder, LDH increased and both study drugs. She 
also stated meropenem hydrate and pazufloxacin mesilate might cause liver disorder, interstitial pneumonitis and 
G-CSF were the possible cause of LDH increased. She stated renal impairment was not related to pemetrexed but 
related to cisplatin.  Updated on 16-Jun-2008; additional information received on 10-Jun-2008 from the 
investigator. Added patient's demographics, concomitant medications, clinical course and investigator's comment. 
Changed seriousness of interstitial pneuonitis from fatal to life-threatening, added death, renal impairment, febrile 
neutr  ,  -  , platelets count decreased and aver disorder to the event. Updated narratives and relevant fields. 
Case dernied. Updated on 08-Jul-2008, additional information received on 03-Jul-21308 from the investigator. Cause 
of death changed to interstitial pneumonitis, deleted 'death' from the event term. Changed seriousness of liver 
disorder' from life-threatening to prolonged hospitalization. Updated clinical course and laboratory data. Updated 
narratives and relevant fields. Case closed. Updated on 22-Aug-2008; additional information received on 21-Aug-
2008. Deleted seriousness of life-threatening' from 'interstitial pneumonitis'. Added 'LDH increased to the event 
and investigator's comment. Updated narratives and relevant fields. Case closed. Update 30-Nov-2009: Upon 
review, this case is being resubmitted due to a correction in the medical history E2B mapping.
