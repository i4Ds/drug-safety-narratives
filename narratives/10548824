RV-CLL-FMDA-383 (SPAIN): A phase I/II study of the safety and activity of lenalidomide plus rituximab (LenRtx) in 
patients with refractory or relapsed chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)
Initial information in this summary case was identified on 13Oct2014 in a scientific literature, more specifically: 
Study phase I/II safety and activity of the combination of Lenalidomide and Rituximab (LenRtx) in patients with 
chronic lymphatic leukemia (CLL) refractory or relapsed. The literature reports the results from a non-Celgene 
sponsored trial, protocol number RV-CLL-FMDA-383. The aim of the study was to determine appropriate guideline 
of lenalidomide in combination (LenRtx). In a 2nd phase is to identify the rate of clinical response. Other objectives 
were: establish toxicity profile and duration of response. Rituximab was fractionated in 1 cycle (100 mg day 1 and 
275 mg/m2l day 2); rest of cycles 500 mg/m2. 
29 patients in 6 centers (Jun09-Nov12) were recruited. 9 patients were excluded from the analysis (4: screening

failure; 5: premature abandonment). The mean age was 71,5 years (58.9-86.2). 11 patients were male and 9 were 
female. Average time  between the diagnosis and treatment start was 7.8 years. Number of previous lines was 2 (1-
4). Maximum tolerated dose (MTD) 15 mg; 8 received dose I (2.5 mg); 3 dose II (5 mg); 3 dose III (10 mg) and 6 
dose IV (15 mg), 13/20 (65%) received six cycles.  Causes for early termination of study: 3 toxicity; 3 progression; 2
SAE and 1 death. At study closure: 10 (50%) patients died [1 ALS (premature termination of study), 1 multifocal 
progressive leukoencephalopaty, 4 infections, 1 multiorganic failure and 3 progression). 13/20 patients progressed 
(65%) with average time until progression 15.4 months. 
No patients had complete response while 7/13 had partial response; 2/13 had stable disease; 4/13 had 
progression. Average follow-up time 12.3 months (1.3-42.6). 33 SAEs were reported: infection 23 (one multifocal 
progressive leukoencephalopaty case); 2 constipation; anemia, hemolytic, autoimmune 1; 1 infusion reaction to 
Rituximab; amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and GI bleeding; 4.

Additional information was received on 27/Feb/2015 in the form of abstract presented at EHA 2015. Specifically: 
LLC-Lenar-08 a Phase I/II study Lenalidomide-Rituximab in Relapse/Refractory Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia.
29 patients from 7 Spanish sites were enrolled. 34 SAE were reported, in 6 cases treatment was discontinued 
definitely (infection 4 patients, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy 1 patient, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis 1
patient). Grade 4 neutropenia was the main adverse event associated with the regimen.
The reporter did not provide serious criteria, but Celgene considered adverse event, hemolytic, autoimmune 
anemia, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), GI bleeding and neutropenia as serious medically important.
