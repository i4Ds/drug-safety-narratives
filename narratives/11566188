Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy and no therapeutic response. Vincristine.
Regulatory report received via ANSM (ref: BS20150487), which refers to a patient. 
Medical history included grade III diffuse large cell B lymphoma diagnosed in Sep-2011 with the form of pelvic 
compressive lymphomatic mass leading to deep vein thrombosis with pulmonary embolism. Concomitant 
medications included mitoxantrone, ifosfamide, etoposide, dexamethasone, cytarabine (high dose), and oxaliplatine
(doses and routes of administration not reported) for unknown indications.
On 08-Oct-2011, the patient started treatment with vincristine Hospira (8 courses of 2 mg, intravenous; lot number 
and frequency not reported), cyclophosphamide (Endoxan, 8 courses of 750 mg/m2, intravenous), prednisone 
(Cortancyl, 8 courses of 60 mg from D2 to D5, oral), doxorubicine Ebewe (intravenous; dose not reported), as part 
of the regimen R-CHOP for B lymphoma; methylprednisolone Mylan (8 courses of 60 mg, intravenous), and 
Uromitexan (8 courses of  550 mg x2 and 6 courses of 890 mg x3) for B lymphoma. On 10-Oct-2011, the patient 
also received rituximab (Mabthera, 8 courses of 350 mg/m2, intravenous) as part of the R-CHOP regimen for B

lymphoma. It was reported that the patient had no therapeutic response to the medications given. On Jun-2012, the
patient received 2 cycles of mitoxantrone, ifosfamide, and etoposide (MIV); without a therapeutic response. Then 
on 12-Jul-2012, the patient received dexamethasone, cytarabine (high dose), and oxaliplatine (DHOx); also without 
a therapeutic response.
On 16-Jul-2012, there was an appearance of clonia of the left lower limb which ceased with Rivotril (dose and route
of administration not reported). On Aug-2012, during the 3rd course of DHOx, in the 3rd line, there was persistent 
clonia of the left lower limb and spasticity of the left upper limb with increased cerebellar syndrome of progressive 
installation since mid Jul-2012 which was suggestive of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy. On an 
unknown date, a lumbar puncture was done to search for JC virus and antineuronal antibodies. On Oct-2012, 
progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy was confirmed by lumbar puncture. On a hematological level, the 
situation was qualified as totally palliative. Radiotherapy was pursued in order to avoid compressive syndrome with 
new thromboembolic complications. Action taken with vincristine Hospira, Mabthera, Endoxan, methylprednisolone 
Mylan, and doxorubicine Ebewe was withdrawn on 09-Mar-2012; Cortancyl was withdrawn on 13-Mar-2012; and 
Uromitexan was withdrawn on 25-Jun-2012.
On (b) (6)  the patient died. Cause of death was not specified. It was unknown if an autopsy was performed.
The reporter's opinion of causality between the events and the suspect drugs was not reported. However, it was 
reported that the JC virus found in the lumbar puncture was probably related to rituximab treatment. It was also 
reported that the effect of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy could have led to the patient's death. The 
French imputability score for the suspect drugs was assessed as C1 S1 I1.
Mabthera, Endoxan, Cortancyl, methylprednisolone Mylan, Uromitexan, and doxorubicine Ebewe were also 
considered as suspects.
