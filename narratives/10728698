Medically Significant
A neurologist spontaneously reported that a 54 year old female patient on TYSABRI (300 mg, IV, QM) for Multiple 
Sclerosis from 05 Dec 2008 to 21 Nov 2014 came under suspicion for progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy 
(PML) (onset 19 Dec 2014).  The patient tested positive for anti-JCV antibodies with an index value of 2.21 on 24 
Oct 2014.  Prior immunomodulatory therapy included AVONEX from 2004 to 2008.  The patient went for her 
TYSABRl infusion of 21 Nov 2014 and reported diplopia (onset Nov 2014).  The patient received her TYSABRl and 
an ophthalmologic consultation was made.  On 19 Dec 2014 an MRI showed lesions suggestive of PML and 
diplopia was confirmed by the ophthalmologist.  No treatment was reported.  Future testing was scheduled to 
include a lumbar puncture (LP) to test the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) for JCV DNA (at (b) (6)  lower 
level of detection 50copies/ mL).  The outcome for the event diplopia is unknown. The event of PML suspicion is

ongoing. The causality for the events of PML suspicion and diplopia is unknown.  TYSABRI therapy was 
discontinued.
French Imputability:  C2 S1 I1
Update 22 Dec 2014:  A LP was done on 22 Dec 2014 and the CSF was sent to (b) (6)  for JCV DNA 
testing.  French Imputability:  C2 S1 I1
Update 08 Jan 2015: Follow-up information was received from the neurologist. The neurologist reported that the 
patient was well. Lumbar puncture was performed on 22 Dec 2014 for CSF JCV DNA testing by (b) (6)   No further 
information was provided.  French Imputability: C2 S1 I1
Update 09 Jan 2015 & 12 Jan 2015: Follow-up information was received from the neurologist via faxed Suspect 
PML Data Collection Tool (DCT). The patient hadn't experienced any interruption of TYSABRI (300 mg, IV, QM) for 
greater than 3 months. The patient presented with first signs of MS in Jun 2003 and MS was diagnosed in Jun 
2004. Prior to TYSABRI, the patient had been treated with Avonex (interferon beta 1a) from 15 Jul 2004 to 04 Nov 
2008. The patient's MS symptoms prior to PML suspicion were cognitive/behavioral since Sep 2011, motor 
(paraparesis, BMRC - presume British Medical Research Council Rating Scale - grade 4 in 2 muscles) since 2009, 
cerebellar (gait ataxia, tandem walking), sensory (pallesthesia decreased in both lower limbs) since Oct 2010, and 
other (ambulatory 500m 10min12). Blood tests performed on 01 Aug 2014 included the following: White cells = 8.83
G/L (N=4 - 10); Neutrophils = 4.698 G/L (N=1.800 - 7.500); Eosinophils = 0.327 G/L (N= 0.000 - 0.500); Basophils =
0.124 G/L (N=0.000 - 0.200); Lymphocytes= 2.932 G/L (N=1.000 - 4.000); Lymphocytes CD3 = 1780/ L; 
Lymphocytes CD8 = 436/ L; Lymphocytes CD4 = 1303/ L; and CD4/CD8 ratio = 2.99. Routine medullar and brain 
MRIs were performed 1 per year and 1 brain MRI was performed every 3 months. The last MRI prior to PML 
suspicion was performed on 26 Sep 2014 and was stable compared to the previous MRI from 04 Jul 2014. The 
patient's EDSS score was 4 on 24 Oct 2014. Signs and symptoms leading to suspect PML included the patient 
presenting with diplopia and ocular movement impairment since 18 Nov 2014. Suspicious findings of PML were 
revealed by a routine MRI performed on 19 Dec 2014, which showed: Lesions recently appeared in the brainstem, 
in the right latero bulbar area, in the upper cerebellar peduncles, on the right side of the tectal plate, in the 
supratentorial area and in the bilateral subcortical frontal area. These lesions appeared in hypersignal B1000 
especially in the brainstem and in the left frontal area. There was no enhancement of these lesions after injection of
the contrast agent. They are suggestive of PML. The lesion load seems to be stable on the brain area and in the 
medullar area with no visible enhancement after injection. This MRI report concludes that new signal abnormalities 
were visible in FLAIR and in diffusion weight imaging sequences in the brainstem and in the bilateral frontal area, 
are suspect of PML lesions. On 19 Dec 2014, absolute leukocyte count was 8.83 G/L (N = 4-10 G/L) and absolute 
lymphocyte count was 2.94 G/L. On 22 Dec 2014, SDMT (presume Symbol Digit Modalities Test) was 61 (hopping 
on 1 foot not possible). A Lumbar puncture was done on 22 Dec 2014 and CSF JCV DNA ((b) (6) ) testing came

back positive (45373 copies/ml). Other CSF analysis was performed but no other information was given. No brain 
biopsy was performed. According to the neurologist, PML diagnosis has been confirmed. At the time of this report, 
no PML or IRIS treatment was given. The patient was hospitalized from (b) (6)  to (b) (6)  and 
underwent 5 plasmatic exchanges: 1st one on (b) (6) , 2nd one on (b) (6) , 3rd one on (b) (6) , 4th
one on (b) (6)  and 5th one on(b) (6) . At the time of this report, the patient was in good condition and 
was not receiving any MS disease therapy. French imputability: C2 S2 I2
Update 15 Jan 2015: Upon internal review, Biogen Idec considers this case confirmed for PML based on positive 
CSF, consistent radiological evidence, and clinical symptoms. French imputability: C2 S2 I2
Update 03 Feb 2015: A different neurologist spontaneously reported that the female patient had a lumbar puncture 
on 03 Feb 2015 for CSF JCV DNA ((b) (6) ) testing. French imputability : C2 S2 I2
Update 04 Feb 2015: The prescribing/treating neurologist spontaneously reported that there was no worsening of 
the SDMT score on (b) (6)  The patient was discharged from the hospital after plasma exchanges. The 
patient then presented with confusional state (onset unknown; presumed symptom of PML) so her husband brought
her to the emergency room on (b) (6)  and the patient was hospitalized. A MRI was consequently performed 
(date unknown) and revealed an extension of the PML lesion in the frontal area. A lumbar puncture was performed 
on(b) (6)  for CSF JCV DNA (b) (6) ) testing. At the time of this report, the patient was still hospitalized.

Update 07 Apr 2015: Additional information was received from the neurologist via a MS Standardized PML Data 
Collection Tool and diagnostic reports. The following test results from 17 Nov 2008 (prior to starting TYSABRI) 
were reported: leukocyte count 7.25 G/l (normal range 4 - 10); lymphocyte count 1.63 G/l; absolute lymphocyte 
count 22.5%; CD4 count 1011/uL; CD8 count 212/uL; CD4/CD8 ratio 4.8. On 17 Nov 2008, the patient s estimated 
EDSS score was 4.0. On 08 Aug 2011, the patient s serum anti-JCV antibody status was positive. On 09 May 
2014, the patient s serum anti-JCV antibody status was positive (index 2.29). The patient also had a negative HIV 
test result on this date. The following test results on TYSABRI prior to PML were reported: 01 Aug 2014 - CD4 
count 1303/uL; CD8 count 436/uL; CD4/CD8 ratio 2.99; 24 Oct 2014 - leukocyte count 8.73 G/L; lymphocyte count 
2.7 G/L; IGG 9.91 g/l (normal range 7 - 16); IgA 2.10 g/l (normal range 0.7 - 4); IgM 0.35 g/l (normal range 0.4 - 
2.3). On 24 Oct 2014, the patients estimated Karnofsky and EDSS scores were 70 to 80 (cares for self; unable to 
carry on normal activity or to do active work - normal activity with effort; some signs or symptoms of disease) and 
4.0, respectively. On 19 Dec 2014, the patient s estimated Karnofsky score was 70 to 80. On 22 Dec 2014, the 
patient s estimated EDSS score was 4.0. An MRI on 05 Jan 2015 showed no Gd enhancing-lesion brainstem and 
frontal lobes stable. The patient's neurological status was stable after plasmatic exchanges at hospital discharge 
and a switch to Gilenya (fingolimod) was planned.  On (b) (6)  the patient was admitted for worsened,

decreased weight, and confusional state lasting for a few days. On (b) (6)  the patient s estimated Karnofsky 
score was 30 to 40 (severely disabled; hospital admission is indicated although death not imminent - disabled; 
requires special care and assistance). A brain MRI on (b) (6)  (when compared to MRI from (b) (6) )
showed extension of the lesions in favor of PML progression with no argument in favor of IRIS as there was no 
contrast enhancement after injection. On (b) (6)  a lumbar puncture was performed and was positive for CSF
JCV DNA ((b) (6) ) at 135,103 copies/mL. On (b) (6) , a MRI was performed which showed extension T2 
lesions in frontal lobes with mild Gd enhancing in three areas. IRIS was suspected. The patient was diagnosed with
IRIS, which was determined by clinical symptoms (NOS) and MRI findings. The patient did not receive 
corticosteroids pre-IRIS onset. Corticosteroids post-IRIS onset included Solumedrol 1000 mg IV daily from (b) (6)  
(b) (6)  to (b) (6)  with no positive effect. On (b) (6)  the patient had the following test results: WBC 9.10 
Giga/l; 3.29 Tera/l; hemoglobin 10.6 g/dl. The following tests were performed (date illegible) with results outside 
normal range: WBC 14.27 Giga/l (normal range 4-10); RBC 3.33 Tera/l (normal range 3.8-5.6); hemoglobin 10.6 
g/dl (normal range 12-16); hematocrit 30.1% (normal range 37-47). A urine culture from (b) (6)  revealed 
Staph epidermidis. The patient experienced vomiting on (b) (6)  and a gastric tube was placed. A diagnosis of
pneumopathy post inhalation was suspected, and the patient was treated with Augmentin (amoxicillin/clavulanic 
acid) from (b) (6)  to (b) (6) . A gastrostomy was planned. The following test results from (b) (6)  were 
reported: CD4 count 1059/uL; CD8 count 294/uL; CD4/CD8 ratio 3.60. A brain MRI on(b) (6)  (when 
compared to MRI from (b) (6) ) showed increase in bifrontal FLAIR hypersignals but also pedunculo-bulbar. 
Frontal contrast enhancements are attenuated compared to the previous MRI. Some restricted diffusion lesions 
appeared on the right frontal area. Maraviroc 300 mg BID was started on (b) (6) . The patient experienced 
worsened status with swallowing disorders and sleepiness, bronchial congestions, and severe acute respiratory 
syndrome. The patient was admitted to the neurological reanimation unit on (b) (6)  for tracheostomy. She 
was discharged on (b) (6)  and returned to the neurological unit. A brain MRI on (b) (6)  showed very 
little increase in the extent of abnormalities (signal Flair and diffusion) visible at the level of the genu of the left 
internal capsule and at the level of the posterior part of the left cingulate cortex. After injection, appearance of a 
slight gyriform contrast enhancement in the bilateral internal frontal area with visualization of a slight contrast 
enhancement within the left frontal hyposignal. No other change. On (b) (6)  the patient experienced cardiac 
standstill, probably caused by suffocation (bronchial obstruction with mucus). On (b) (6)  the patient s 
estimated Karnofsky score was 10 to 20 (moribund; fatal processes progressing rapidly - very sick; hospital 
admission necessary; active supportive treatment necessary). An MRI on (b) (6)  showed increased frontal 
lesion evocative of PML progression. On (b) (6)  the patient experienced respiratory pauses and fecaloid 
vomiting (questioned sub occlusive syndrome). At the time of this report, the patient was alive and was in the 
hospital. As of (b) (6)  the event of PML was ongoing with worsening. As of (b) (6)  (presume(b) (6)  
(b) (6) ) the event of IRIS was stable. Causality for the events of PML and IRIS was assessed as related to TYSABRI.

Update 27 Jul 2015: Additional information was received from the neurologist via a MS Standardized PML Data 
Collection Tool. The patient is alive, in the hospital and currently not on any therapy for MS. The patient's most 
recent brain MRI was performed on (b) (6)  (results not provided). The patient was diagnosed with IRIS 
determined by MRI findings. IRIS symptoms included cognitive / behavioral symptoms (onset (b) (6) ). The 
patient did not receive corticosteroids pre-IRIS. Post-IRIS, the patient received Solumedrol (methylprednisolone;1 g
by IV for five days) from (b) (6)  to (b) (6)  (previously reported). On(b) (6)  the patient had the 
following lab values: leukocyte count 9.91 G/L and lymphocyte count 3.805 G/L. The neurologist assessed the 
Karnofsky and EDSS scores on (b) (6)  as 40 (disabled; requires special care and assistance) and 8.5. 
Currently, the patient has not recovered from PML and the outcome is unknown for IRIS. Causality for the events of
PML and IRIS were assessed as related to TYSABRI. French Imputability: C2S2I2
