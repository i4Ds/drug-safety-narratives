Medically Significant
Autonomous Community: Valencia
A physician spontaneously reported that a female patient (age unspecified) receiving TYSABRI (300 mg, IV, QM) 
from an unknown date experienced a suspicion of PML. Indication for TYSABRI was multiple sclerosis (MS), 
diagnosed on an unreported date. No medical history or concomitant medications were reported. 
The physician informed that the patient was treated with TYSABRI for more than two years. The patient has been 
stable (clinically) with the treatment until she started with cognitive impairment, visual problems and walking 
problems. The STARTIFY test to detect anti-JCV antibodies has not been performed in this patient. An MRI was 
performed and the images are suspicious of PML.

The physician assessed the suspicion of PML to be related to TYSABRI. At the time of this report, the outcome of 
the suspicion of PML was not yet recovered. TYSABRI was discontinued in an unknown date.
Update 02 Jul 2013: New information provided by the neurologist. A lumbar puncture was performed on 01 Jul 
2013, the CSF will be sent to the (b) (6)  laboratory to detect JCV by PCR.
Update 03 Jul 2013: New information provided by the neurologist. The patient is 50 years old. The first symptoms of
MS appeared in Mar 2006 with alteration of walking. In May 2007 the patient started treatment with Avonex, but due
to the progression of the disease in Mar 2010 the treatment was switched to TYSABRI. In Mar 2013 was 
administered the last dose of TYSABRI and the neurologist decided not to administer another dose because the 
patient started with visual symptoms and alteration of walking.
Update 10 Jul 2013: New information provided by the neurologist. The PCR performed in the (b) (6)  laboratory was 
negative; JCV DNA copies were not detected. The patient continues with a clinical suspicion of PML: cognitive 
impairment, ataxia and nearly blind. The neurologist will send an extra CSF sample to (b) (6)  lab for a PCR 
analysis.
Update 19 Jul 2013: New information provided by the neurologist. The result of the PCR to detect JCV in CSF 
performed at (b) (6)  laboratory is positive, 762 copies/ml were detected. The patient is stable with important congnitive
impairment, ataxia and cortical blindness. One week ago she was treated with immunoglobulins and corticosteroids
for 5 days. Currently, the patient doesn?t receive any treatment. 
Update 24 Jul 2013: Additional information provided by the neurologist. The MRI performed on September 17, 2012
showed multiple supratentorial lesions with affectation of corpus callosum splenium and anterior side  of 
protuberance. No catchment of contrast. On April 17, 2013 was performed another MRI and showed multiple 
lesions known and the appearance of white matter hyperintensity in the right temporal and bilateral occipital without 
mass effect suggesting LMP. Another MRI was performed on June 19, 2013 and showed persistence of images 
compatible with PML, with poorly defined edges and more extensive edema with contrast enhancement that was 
not present in the previous study. Affectation of both external capsules of new appearance,  and findings consistent
with IRIS. The TYSABRI treatment was discontinued in March 2013 due to the onset of visual impairment, poorly 
defined by the patient,  without papillitis and more suggestive of cortical blindness. The April 11, 2013 was 
performed visual potentials that showed greater impairment of optic nerve of axonal level than demyelinating. The

suspected symptoms of PML (visual impairment), according to the patient started during the month of March, first 
without much symptoms, but later added gait disturbance with ataxia type right hemiparesis and subsequently 
showed significant cognitive impairment, at that time Tysabri treatment was suspended two months ago. 
Update 30 Jul 2013: Upon internal review Biogen Idec considers this case confirmed for PML.
Update 11 Sep 2013: Additional information was received from the neurologist via a MS Standardized PML Data 
Collection Tool. The neurologist assessed the patient?s estimated Karnofsky score prior to starting TYSABRI as 80
(normal activity with effort; some signs or symptoms of disease), on TYSABRI prior to PML as 60 (requires 
occasional assistance, but is able to care for most of personal needs), and at time of PML diagnosis as 40 
(disabled; requires special care and assistance). The neurologist assessed the patient?s estimated EDSS scores 
as 3.5 on 29 Mar 2006, 5.5 on 01 Sep 2010, and 7 on 01 Apr 2013. On 20 Sep 2011, the patient had an MRI (result
not reported). On 01 Feb 2013, the patient had an MRI (result not reported). On 20 Feb 2013, the patient tested 
negative for blood JCV DNA and negative for HIV. The patient has not been tested for serum anti-JCV Antibody 
status and is residing at home. Outcome for the event of PML was not reported. Causality was assessed as related 
to TYSABRI.
Update 08 Jan 2014: Additional information was received from the neurologist via a MS Standardized PML Data 
Collection Tool. The patient is alive, residing in a nursing home, and is not currently on any MS therapy. The 
neurologist assessed the patient?s current clinical status as having bilateral blindness, asomatognosia, ataxia, and 
that denomination and evocation tasks were impaired. The neurologist assessed the patient?s estimated Karnofsky
score on 06 Jan 2014 to be 40 (disabled, requires special care and assistance) and assessed the estimated EDSS 
on 14 Dec 2013 to be 8. An MRI was done on 23 Sep 2013 (results not provided). The patient has been diagnosed 
with IRIS, determined by clinical symptoms and MRI findings. Cognitive/ behavioral and visual (blindness) 
symptoms were noted with an onset date of 01 Jul 2013, as well as cerebellar (ataxia) symptoms. The patient 
received IV immunoglobulin from 21 Jul to 26 Jul 2013 as treatment. No additional lumbar punctures have been 
performed. The patient has not recovered from PML and recovered for the event of IRIS. Causality for the event of 
PML was assessed as related to TYSABRI; causality of the event of IRIS to TYSABRI was not provided.
Update 20 Feb 2014: New information provided by the neurologist. The patient is clinically stable. The patient is 
better from the ataxia and cognitive impairment, however the blindness remains.
Update 11 Jul 2014: Additional information was received from the neurologist via a MS Standardized PML Data 
Collection Tool. The patient is alive, residing at home, and is not currently on any MS therapy. On 09 Jul 2014, the 
neurologist assessed the patient?s estimated Karnofsky score to be 40 (disabled; requires special care and 
assistance). On 14 May 2014, the patient?s estimated EDSS score was 7.5. A brain MRI performed on 29 Sep

2013 showed progression signs of PML. The patient has recovered from PML and IRIS. Causality for the events 
was assessed as related to TYSABRI.
