This case subsidiary sponsored trial: 
cems a 62-year-old Caucasian male. 
Medical history included: hypertension, dyspnea since Nov2011, thrombocytopenia, hypokalemia, anemia grade 3, 
respiratory infection and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Concomitant medications included: folic acid, 
cyanocobalamin, dexamethasone, paracetamol, amiodarone, omeprazole, metoclopramide, lactulose, prednisone, 
fenoterol hydrobromide, ipratropium bromide and theophylline. 
On 03May12, the patient began receiving pemetrexed 500mg/m2 intravenous (IV) in combination with cisplatin 
75mg/m2 IV every 21 days for the treatment of NSCLC. On 13Jun12, the patient had a scan that did not show 
disease progression, butl titalent deteri
received on 03Jul12. On elorated clinically. Prior to the event, the last dose of study therapy was d ays after last receiving study therapy, the patient presented to the
Emergency Room due to dyspnea, febrile neutropenia and cough and was admitted to the hospital. On ap t, the 
patient was transferred to intensive care with progressive worsening of symptoms. The patient experienced febrile 
neutropenia grade 4. Ong.. platelet count was 17,000, neutrophils were not able to be measured (very low) 
and anaerobic blood culture showed streptococcus pneumonia. The patient was diagnosed with septic shock. On 
11111111 platelet count was 24,000 and the patient died that same day due to acute respiratory failure and 
refractory shock. The mechanism of respiratory failure was unknown. An autopsy was not performed. Study therapy 
had not been discontinued prior to the death. 
In the opinion of the investigator, acute respiratory failure grade 4 was not related to pemetrexed, cisplatin or 
protocol procedure; patient had history of dyspnea since Nov2011. The event of febrile neutropenia and septic 
shock were possibly related to pemetrexed and cisplatin due to temporal relation with chemotherapy. Septic shock 
and febrile neutropenia were not related to protocol procedure. 
This case is linked to case BR201208001623.
