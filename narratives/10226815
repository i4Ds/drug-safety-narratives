Medically Significant
A neurologist reported via a Biogen Idec Medical Science Liaison that a female patient, age unknown, on TYSABRI 
(dosing regimen unknown) for an unknown indication, was hospitalized (date unknown) for progressive multifocal 
leukoencephalopathy (PML; onset unknown).The patient tested positive for the presence of anti-JCV antibodies on 
an unknown date. At the time of this report, the patient had received about 80 infusions of TYSABRI. Medical 
history, prior use of immunosuppressants and immunomodulators, concomitant medications, testing details, and 
treatment were not reported. The causality for the event, PML, was assessed as possibly related to TYSABRI. 
Additional information is expected.

(300 mg, IV, QM) from 2007 to Nov 2013 for highly active RRMS diagnosed in 2007 was hospitalized twice for PML
(onset Dec 2013) from (b) (6)  to (b) (6)  and(b) (6)  to(b) (6)  According to the neurologist,
the patient has received a total of 80 TYSABRI infusions from 2007 to Nov 2013. The patient has a medical history 
of hypothyroidism and haemochromatosis. Concomitant medications include L-Thyroxin (levothyroxine) 150?g and 
Iodine 50mg for hypothyroidism.  The patient did not have any prior medication with immunosuppressants.
Relevant diagnostic tests include the following: JCV PCR in CSF (Mar 2014) done at reference lab (b) (6)  27 
copies/ml, positive; MRIs of the brain (Feb 2014, Apr 2014, 05 May 2014, 08 May 2014). The patient was known to 
be anti-JCV-antibody positive since summer 2011.  Treatment included plasmapheresis, mirtazapine (60mg QD, 
since 20 Mar 2014 and continued), and mefloquine (250 mg QW, since Apr 2014 and continued); in addition 
omeprazole (20mg, QD since Apr 2014 and continued) for gastric protection.  The neurologist provided notes for an
outpatient visit on 13 Mar 2014 which indicated that between 2007 and 2013, while on TYSABRI, the patient had 
been relapse free and there had been no progression of disability.  However, in Dec 2013, the patient experienced 
slowly progressing speech disorder, gait disturbance, and numbness in left body half.  In the further course, urge 
incontinence and residual urine occurred. In Jan 2014, cortisone pulse therapy (5 x 1000 mg) was unsuccessful (a 
second cortisone pulse therapy was mentioned; however date or dose not specified).  Since Jan 2014, the patient 
has noticed gradual worsening of all reported symptoms.  The MRI in Feb 2014 showed several new partially 
contrast enhancing lesions in left precentral gyrus caudal of the hand area and left frontal gyrus in left cerebral 
peduncle. Furthermore, there was progression in size of a lesion in the right antero-lateral thalamus without 
disturbance of the blood brain barrier on review of that imaging study on 13 Mar 2014 when suspicion of PML was 
raised.  At time of presentation (13 Mar 2014), assisted walking distance was 100 m, free walking distance only few
meters, EDSS was 6.0, and pathological findings indicated dysarthria (otherwise cranial nerves OK), 
hemihypoesthesia on the left side, and hemiataxia on the left. The discharge summary from the hospitalization from
(b) (6)  to (b) (6)  indicated that MS was diagnosed in 2001 with the first clinical signs in 1998.  In Jan 
2014, the patient complained of mild dysarthria, hypoesthesia, feeling of heaviness in left arm, which was treated 
with 2 courses of cortisone pulse for 5 days. No improvement was reported, but progression of gait disorder and 
fine motor impairment in left hand. Findings on admission included marked spastic ataxic gait, mild cognitive 
impairment, gaze-evoked nystagmus, saccadic eye pursuit left > right, mild dysarthria, impaired fine motor skills in 
the left hand and ataxia at pointing test, Babinski positive on both sides. Testing for arm drift was positive on the left
and testing for leg drift was positive on the right.  Other pathologic lab results: TSH 0.31 mU/L (normal range not 
reported), leukocytes 11.8/nL (normal range not reported) which normalized in the further course; urinary tract 
infection with nitrite positive. Treatment included 5 sessions of immunoadsorption from(b) (6)  - (b) (6)
EDSS at time of discharge was 5.0. Diagnoses at discharge were CNS infection with JC-virus and uncomplicated 
urinary tract infection, which was treated with fosfomycin. The discharge summary from the hospitalization from (b)(6)  
(b) (6)  to (b) (6)  indicated that the patient was readmitted to the hospital due to worsening of speech 
disorder, weakness in left body half, double vision, and dysphagia. Neurological examination revealed moderate 
dysarthria, facial palsy, dysphagia, moderate senso-motor hemiparesis (more pronounced affecting the arms and

more pronounced distal), Babinski's sign positive both sides. On (b) (6)  cMRI [control MRI] gave evidence of 
progression of multiple bilateral demyelinated lesions with corresponding disruption of the blood brain barrier. There
was progression of findings in the right thalamus with disruption of blood brain barrier and disturbed diffusion. On 
(b) (6)  cMRI showed unchanged bi-hemispheric lesions; large right thalamic lesion and smaller left thalamic 
lesion; impression: stable finding. CSF testing revealed pleocytosis of 12/nL and test for JC-virus was positive. 
Therapy comprised another cortisone pulse for 5 days, placement of a feeding tube due to dysphagia, mefloquine 
and escalation of mirtazapine medication. On (b) (6)  the patient was transferred to a rehabilitation facility.
The event of PML is ongoing and causality was assessed as related to TYSABRI. 
Update 29 May 2014: Upon internal review, this case has been confirmed for PML based on positive CSF, MRI 
finding, and clinical symptoms.
Update 04 Jul 2014: Additional information was received from the neurologist via a MS Standardized PML Data 
Collection Tool. Brain MRI performed on 28 Jun 2012 revealed lesions typical for MS, no evidence of floridity. Brain 
MRI performed on 07 Feb 2013 showed no changes compared with previous examination from Jun 2012, lesions 
consistent with MS, and no pathological contrast agent enhancement evident for floridity. Brain MRI performed on 
15 Nov 2013 revealed mild progress of MS with new discrete contrast-enhancing lesion in mesencephalon. 
Otherwise no changes compared with previous examination - multiple periventricular MS lesions. The neurologist 
assessed the patient?s estimated Karnofsky and EDSS scores, respectively, as follows: 90 (able to carry on normal
activity; minor signs or symptoms of disease) and 1 in 2007; 90 and 1.0 in Oct 2013; EDSS 6.0 on 13 Mar 2014; 
Karnofsky score of 20 (very sick; hospital admission necessary; active supportive treatment necessary) in Apr 
2014; EDSS 8.5 on (b) (6)  A lumbar puncture was performed in (b) (6)  and in (b) (6)  and were both 
positive for CSF JCV DNA (Mar 2014 - 27 copies per mL). Currently, the patient resides in a rehabilitation facility 
and has not recovered from PML. Causality for the event was assessed as related to TYSABRI.
Update 17 Oct 2014: A professor of neurology at the university hospital spontaneously reported via a sales 
representative that a female patient on TYSABRI was suspected having PML. The female patient was 45 years old 
at the time of PML diagnosis which had been made in another hospital. The patient had received a total of 80 
TYSABRI infusions.  No further information provided. 
Update 22 Oct 2014: Additional information was provided by the professor of neurology at the university hospital.
The patient had presented for an outpatient visit at the hospital recently.  Liquor puncture was performed (date 
unknown) and CSF JCV DNA PCR did not reveal any copies. MRI was also performed on unknown date (results 
not reported). According to the reporting professor, the patient is severely affected by PML. No further information 
provided.

Update 28 May 2015: Additional information was received from the hospital neurologist via a MS Standardized PML
Data Collection Tool. The patient is alive, residing at home, and is currently not on any therapy for Multiple 
Sclerosis. The neurologist assessed the patient's estimated Karnofsky and EDSS scores on 03 Jan 2015 to be 40 
(disabled; requires special care and assistance) and 7.5. On 02 Feb 2015, a brain MRI was performed (results not 
provided). As of 03 Jan 2015, the outcome for the event of PML was reported as not recovered and the patient has 
recovered from event of IRIS. Causality for the events was assessed as related to TYSABRI.
