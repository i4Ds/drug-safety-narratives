AER 1339656 is an interventional clinical study case, received on 25/Jan/2014, from a physician, and concerns a 
59 year old female patient (patient number : (b) (6) ) who developed progressive multifocal leucoencephalopathy 
whilst enrolled in (b) (6)
(b) (6)
The patient's medical history included exeresis of melanoma, ovarian serous cystadenofibromas, uterine 
leiomyoma, she was immuno deficient with no chronic viral infections, HIV negative, had no history of herpes 
simplex/zoster or CMV pneumocystic carinii pneumonia and no known CNS pathology (lupus or lymphoma). The 
patient did not have a stored serum sample available that was drawn within the previous five years of event onset. 
Concurrent conditions included dyslipidemia, left ventricular hypertrophy, hypercholesterolemia and contrast 
medium allergy. Concomitant medications included aciclovir, sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim given for antiviral and 
antibacterial prophylaxis respectively, nadroparin calcium for thromboprophylaxis, rosuvastatin calcium and 
fenofibrate. No past drugs were reported.
On 14/Mar/2012 the patient was diagnosed with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Baseline brain MRI was 
not performed. On 04/Apr/2012, the patient started intravenous (IV) obinutuzumab (1000mg once every three 
weeks, lot number: PDH0000137), IV cyclophosphamide (1200mg, once every three weeks), IV doxorubicin (dose 
and form not reported), IV vincristine (2mg once every three weeks) and oral prednisone (100mg for five days per 
cycle). On 19/Jul/2012, she received the most recent doses of cyclophosphamide (1200 mg), doxorubicin (80 mg) 
and vincristine (2 mg) prior to event onset and then cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin and vincristine were stopped. 
On 26/Apr/2012, obinutuzumab was reduced to 1000mg once per cycle. On 23/Jul/2012, she received the most 
recent dose of prednisone (100 mg) prior to event onset and therapy was stopped. On 30/Aug/2012, she received

the most recent dose of obinutuzumab (250 ml with dose concentration of 4 mg/ml) prior to event onset and therapy
with obinutuzumab was stopped. On 15/Oct/2012, she started with 2 cycles of R-DHAP and received  rituximab 
(600 mg) and dexamethasone (40 mg). On 16/Oct/2012, she received cisplatin (170 mg).  On 17/Oct/2012, she 
received cytarabine (3400 mg). On 19/Oct/2012, she received dexamethasone.  On 16/Nov/2012, she received 
rituximab and dexamethasone, on 17/Nov/2012 cisplatin, on 18/Nov/2012 cytarabine and 20/Nov/2012 
dexamethasone. High dose sequential chemotherapy followed by autologous stem cell transplantation was 
decided. On 23/Dec/2012, she received cyclophosphamide (8.5 g) and cytarabine (3400mg).  On 25/Dec/2012, she
received rituximab. On 28/Jan/2013, she received her last dose of cytarabine. On an unspecified date in Feb/2013, 
the patient experienced febrile neutropenia after high dose Aracytine, her blood cultures (09/Feb-13/Feb/2013) 
were positive for staphylococcus epidermidis and staphylococcus hominis. The fever responded to therapy with 
liposomal amphotericin. On 05/Apr/2013, she received etoposide (3400mg). On 10/May/2013, fotemustine (500mg)
was administered. From 11/May/2013 to 14/May/2013, etoposide twice daily (170mg) was administered. On 
15/May/2013, melphalan (240mg) was administered. On (b) (6)  autologous stem cell transplantation was 
performed. Baseline laboratory tests were run on 14/Nov/2013, results were as follows: blood immunoglobulin M 
(IgM) 32mg/dL (normal range: 40-230), Blood immunoglobulin G (IgG): 457mg/dL (normal range: 700-1600), 
absolute neutrophil count (ANC): 4.00x10^3/ul (normal range: 1.9-8.0) and white blood cell count (WBC): 6.59^3/ul 
(normal range: 4.8-10.8). CD4, CD8, and CD20 tests were not done.  From 15/Nov/2013 to 05/Dec/2013 and then 
from 11/Dec/2013 to 31/Dec/2013, lenalidomide was administered. From December 2013, the patient reported 
hyposthenia of the right arm. The symptoms increased in seriousness following the medical examination. The 
patient also developed increased muscle tone (spasticity). Later, a progressive motor deficiency of the patient's 
right arm was noted. On 07/Jan/2014, the patient's absolute neutrophil count (ANC) was 1.8 x10^3/ul (normal 
range: 1.9-8.0) and white blood cell count (WBC) was 4.54^3/ul (normal range: 4.8-10.8). CD4, CD8, and CD20 
tests were not performed. On 17/Jan/2014, a brain MRI revealed subcortical white matter alteration. Progressive 
multifocal leucoencephalopathy (grade 3) was suspected and the patient was hospitalised on (b) (6) . During 
hospitalisation, cerebrospinal fluid analysis revealed: JCV, CMV, EBV, HHV6, HHV7, HHV8 and HSV were all 
negative. On (b) (6)  the patient was discharged from hospital. On(b) (6)  the patient was readmitted to
hospital and a follow-up brain MRI confirmed subcortical white matter alteration (this assessment confirmed what 
had been found with the previous one). On(b) (6)  her blood immunoglobulin M (IgM) was 32mg/dL (normal 
range: 40-230) and blood immunoglobulin G was (IgG): 381mg/dL (normal range: 700-1600) and she was treated 
with globulin, immune (Immunoglobulin) 0.5 g/kg until 09/Feb/2014. From (b) (6)  the patient had 
hyposthenia of the right leg with increased muscle tone (spasticity) and tremor of the right arm. On (b) (6)
she was treated with mirtazapine 15mg daily. On (b) (6)  a brain biopsy was performed which revealed six 
pieces of brain tissue characterized by loss myelin and inflammatory infiltrated composed most of all by histiocytes 
CD68 +. The glial cells population was composed in part by astrocytes with eosinophil cytoplasm (GFAP +) with 
nucleus with increased dimensions, irregular form and clear nucleolus and in part by oligodendroglial elements with 
iper-chromatic nucleolus. Both populations described resulted immuno reactive in their nucleus for P53 and Ki67.

No mitosis, no necrosis, and rare calcification. This morphological description positively confirmed the clinical 
suspicion of progressive multifocal leucoencephalopathy. The patient underwent unspecified surgery for the event 
of progressive multifocal leucoencephalopathy and received treatment with IG vena (globulin immune). On 
17/Apr/2014, the real time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was positive for John Cunningham (JC) virus DNA 
from brain biopsy (pathogen code 107). On 06/Aug/2014, the patient received infusion of anti JCV/CD8 activated 
lymphocytes. On 07/Aug/2014, delorazepam 0.5mg and quetiapine 100mg daily were started. On 13/Aug/2014, the 
dose of quetiapine was increased to 125mg daily. In Sep/2014, delorazepam was stopped. On 05/Sep/2014 
Movicol was given for constipation. On 10/Sep/2014, 22/Oct/2014 and 02/Dec/2014, the patient received further 
infusions of anti JCV/CD8 activated lymphocytes. On 13/Jan/2015, a neurologist consultation and brain MRI were 
performed and showed cognitive and behavioral improvement, motor aphasia was ongoing with radiological 
improvement. On the same day, mirtazapine was stopped and the dose of quetiapine was reduced to 75mg daily. 
On the 20/Jan/2015 Movicol (for constipation) was changed to taken on demand. On 21/Jan/2015, another visit 
showed cognitive improvement but motor deficit was ongoing. On the 31/Mar/2015 a brain MRI scan showed 
improvement. A visit to site on the 26/Jun/2015 showed the patient in a stable clinical condition. 
At the time reporting, the progressive multifocal leucoencephalopathy was not recovered. 
The following medication, started after the onset of progressive multifocal leucoencephalopathy, was taken 
concomitantly: metformin (diabetes), citalopram (anxiety), pantoprazole (gastroprotection), potassium chloride 
retard (mineral support), cholecalciferol (Dibase) (vitamin integration), nadroparin (thromboprophylaxis) and 
oxycodone/paracetamol (Depalgos) (pain).
A guided questionnaire indicated that the Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) was ongoing after therapy with 
obinutuzumab and CHOP and for this reason she received high dose chemotherapy followed by autologous stem 
cell transplantation. Due to the long treatment history, she experienced infectious complications which resolved 
after antibiotic treatment.
The investigator assessed the progressive multifocal leucoencephalopathy as not related to cyclophosphamide, 
doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisone but related to obinutuzumab, rituximab, autologous stem cell transplantation
(procedure) and unspecified concomitant medication. The investigator did not assess the causality of progressive 
multifocal leucoencephalopathy with cisplatin, cytarabine, dexamethasone, etoposide, fotemustine and melphalan. 
No other causal relationships were reported. The company assessed the event progressive multifocal 
leucoencephalopathy as not related to cisplatin, cytarabine, dexamethasone, etoposide, fotemustine and 
melphalan.
No further information was provided.
