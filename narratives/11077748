*** RETAINED DUPLICATE: THIS CASE WAS ALSO PREVIOUSLY REPORTED AS GENENTECH CASE = 
THIS IS A SPONTANEOUS REPORT REFERRING TO AN ELDERLY MALE PATIENT OF UNKNOWN AGE. A 
PHYSICIAN REPORTED THIS CASE.
NO PAST MEDICAL HISTORY AND ALLERGIES WERE REPORTED. CONCURRENT CONDITION WAS 
REPORTED AS UNKNOWN.
ON AN UNSPECIFIED DATE, THE PATIENT WAS INITIATED ON RITUXIMAB (DOSE, FREQUENCY NOT 
REPORTED, IV) WITH CHOP THERAPY FOR THE INDICATION OF MALIGNANT LYMPHOMA.
ON (b) (6)  THE PATIENT WAS SUSPECTED TO HAVE PROGRESSIVE MULTIFOCAL 
LEUCOENCEPHALOPATHY. IT WAS REPORTED THAT ON AN UNSPECIFIED DATE, REPORTED AS 
APPROXIMATELY ONE AND HALF MONTH AFTER THE LAST DOSE OF RITUXIMAB, THE PATIENT WAS 
TRANSFERRED TO THE NEUROLOGY DEPARTMENT OF THE REPORTER'S HOSPITAL AS THE PATIENT 
HAD BECOME UNABLE TO READ NEWSPAPER OR TO WRITE.
IT WAS ALSO REPORTED THAT PATIENT WAS PLANNED TO HAVE AN EXAMINATION FOR BLOOD 
CONCENTRATION OF RITUXIMAB AND AN ASSAY FOR "JB" VIRUS.
THE EVENT OF SUSPECTED PROGRESSIVE MULTIFOCAL LEUCOENCEPHALOPATHY WAS PERSISTING.
THE PHYSICIAN DID NOT PROVIDE THE SERIOUSNESS CRITERIA OF THE EVENT OF SUSPECTED 
PROGRESSIVE MULTIFOCAL LEUCOENCEPHALOPATHY.
THE PHYSICIAN ASSESSED THE EVENT OF SUSPECTED PROGRESSIVE MULTIFOCAL 
LEUCOENCEPHALOPATHY AS PROBABLY RELATED TO RITUXIMAB. IN THE REPORTER'S OPINION, 
OTHER POSSIBLE ETIOLOGICAL FACTOR INCLUDED CHOP THERAPY.
THE EVENT WAS IDENTIFIED AS MEDICALLY SIGNIFICANT BY ZENYAKU.

IT WAS REPORTED THAT THERAPY WITH RITUXIMAB WAS NOT REINTRODUCED.
THE EVENT OF PROGRESSIVE MULTIFOCAL LEUCOENCEPHALOPATHY WAS PERSISTING.
THE PHYSICIAN ASSESSED THE EVENT OF PROGRESSIVE MULTIFOCAL LEUCOENCEPHALOPATHY AS

THIS CONFIRMED CASE OF PROGRESSIVE MULTIFOCAL LEUKOENCEPHALOPATHY (PML) IS BEING 
EXPEDITED PER GENENTECH'S ENHANCED PV PLAN FOR PML.
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION IS BEING REQUESTED.
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION RECEIVED ON 10 SEP 2010:
ON 06 AUG 2010 AND 09 AUG 2010, THE PATIENT WAS TREATED WITH MEFLOQUINE HYDROCHLORIDE 
(2 TABLETS /DAY). FROM THE SECOND WEEK OF THE MONTH, THE PATIENT STARTED TO RECEIVE 
TREATMENT WITH MEFLOQUINE HYDROCHLORIDE (1 TABLET, WEEKLY). THE EVENT OF PROGRESSIVE 
MULTIFOCAL LEUCOENCEPHALOPATHY PROGRESSED GRADUALLY ON IMAGING. AN MRI-FLAIR 
SHOWED THE LESIONS EXTENDED TO THE BILATERAL FRONTAL LOBES AND OCCIPITAL LOBES. THE 
PATIENT EXHIBITED WORSENING OF CLINICAL SYMPTOMS INCLUDING PSYCHIC PARALYSIS OF GAZE, 
OPTIC ATAXIA, AGNOSIA, APHASIA, LEFT- RIGHT DISORIENTATION, ANARITHMIA AND AGRAPHIA.
FROM 30 AUG 2010, THE DOSE OF MEFLOQUINE HYDROCHLORIDE WAS INCREASED TO 2 TABLETS 
WEEKLY DUE TO THE POOR CLINICAL COURSE.
THE EVENT OF PROGRESSIVE MULTIFOCAL LEUCOENCEPHALOPATHY WAS PERSISTING.
NO FURTHER INFORMATION IS EXPECTED. CASE IS CLOSED.
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION RECEIVED ON 30-SEP-2010
THE SPECIMEN COLLECTED IN THE THIRD MONTH AFTER RITUXIMAB INFUSION REVEALED THE

ON(b) (6)  THE PATIENT WAS FOUND TO BE POSITIVE FOR JCV IN THE CSF, AND WAS 
DIAGNOSED WITH PML.
ON 05 AUG 2010, THE PATIENT STARTED TO RECEIVE AN ANTIMALARIAL DRUG, MEFLOQUINE 
HYDROCHLORIDE (250 MG, WEEKLY). FROM 02 SEP 2010, THE DOSE OF MEFLOQUINE HYDROCHLORIDE
INCREASED TO 500 MG WEEKLY. AFTER DIAGNOSIS, THE PATIENT EXHIBITED PROGRESSIVE 
SYMPTOMS INCLUDING INABILITY TO NAME OBJECTS, A DECLINE IN THE COGNITIVE FUNCTION AND 
SPATIAL NEGLECT. SUBSEQUENTLY, IN SEP 2010, THE PATIENT DEVELOPED FRONTAL LOBE 
SYMPTOMS SUCH AS IRRITABILITY AND EXCITATION, AND WAS REQUIRED TO BE KEPT UNDER 
SEDATION.
IN OCT 2010, THE PATIENT GRADUALLY BECAME DROWSY. SINCE MID-OCT 2010, THE PATIENT HAD 
AKINETIC MUTISM. IN THE MEANTIME, THERE WERE GRADUALLY EXPANDING LESIONS IN THE WHITE 
MATTER OF THE RIGHT FRONTAL, LEFT FRONTAL-PARIETAL AND BILATERAL OCCIPITAL LOBES ON MRI 
IMAGES OF THE HEAD. THE COPY NUMBER OF JCV REMAINED ON THE SAME LEVEL FROM AUG 2010 TO
OCT 2010.
IN THE END OF NOV 2010, THE COPY NUMBER OF JCV BECAME LESS THAN 200, AND ACCORDINGLY, 
THE IMAGING FINDINGS BECAME UNCHANGED. HOWEVER, THE PATIENT STILL HAD AKINETIC MUTISM 
WITHOUT IMPROVEMENT.
THE PHYSICIAN ASSESSED THE EVENT OF PROGRESSIVE MULTIFOCAL LEUCOENCEPHALOPATHY AS 
POSSIBLY RELATED TO RITUXIMAB.
THE PHYSICIAN'S COMMENT: THE EVENT OCCURRED IMMEDIATELY AFTER R-CHOP THERAPY. IT TOOK 
5 MONTHS UNTIL THE BLOOD CONCENTRATION OF RITUXIMAB FELL BELOW MEASURABLE LIMITS, AND 
WHICH MAY HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO MULTIPLICATION OF JCV. IN ADDITION, AFTER INITIATION OF 
RITUXIMAB, A STATISTICALLY INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF JCV WAS OBSERVED. RITUXIMAB 
AFFECTS B-CELL SYSTEM AND DOES NOT DIRECTLY AFFECT T-CELL SYSTEM. HOWEVER, GIVEN THE 
INTERACTION BETWEEN B-CELL AND T-CELL, RITUXIMAB MAY HAVE INDIRECTLY CONTRIBUTED TO 
THE ONSET OF PML.
NO FURTHER INFORMATION IS EXPECTED. CASE IS CLOSED.

Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) exhibited a slightly elevated protein level (54 mg/dL), with a normal cell count (2/mcL). 
Real-time polymerase chain reaction for the JC polyoma virus (JCV) in the CSF yielded a positive result of 
1.36x106 copies/mL. Other laboratory studies demonstrated negative serological results for HIV infection, with 
decreased absolute CD4+ T cell (305/mcL) and CD19+ cell (3/ mcL) counts and a normal CD8+ T cell count 
(596/mcL). Based on the patient's clinical and MRI findings, as well as the presence of JCV in the CSF, a diagnosis
of PML was made according to the PML diagnostic criteria. He received treatment with 15 mg of mirtazapine per 
day. The total clinical course of the PML was approximately 10 months.
The authors reported that the patient developed rituximab-associated progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy.

This confirmed case of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) is being expedited per 
Roche/Genentech Enhanced Pharmacovigilance Plan for PML.
Additional information was received on 07/May/2015. Following information was added to the case.
At the end of the third cycle of the R-CHOP regimen, the patient developed right-sided deficits in vision. A 
neurological examination revealed word amnesia, agraphia, right-sided homonymous hemianopsia and bilateral 
ideomotor apraxia. Brain MRI showed left parieto-occipital and right frontal hyperintense white matter lesions on 
FLAIR images without gadolinium enhancement. In addition, approximately three months after the onset of PML, 
mefloquine therapy was started at a dose of 500 mg twice weekly then subsequently prescribed at a dose of 250 
mg weekly. Approximately four weeks after the onset of PML, hematological analysis revealed a persistent 
decrease in both the absolute CD4+ T cell (270/mcL) and CD19+ cell (16/mcL) counts. After the dose was 
increased from 250 mg to 500 mg weekly, the concentrations of mefloquine in the serum and CSF rose to 2.05 
mcM and 0.116 mcM, respectively, while the JCV DNA copy number decreased to 2.0 x 10^5 copies/mL. However, 
the patient's right-sided hemitaresis progressed and he gradually developed a disturbance of consciousness. 
Approximately six months after the onset of PML, the JCV DNA copy number finally decreased to 254 copies/mL. 
The administration of mefloquine at a dose of 500 mg weekly was continued thereafter, and the JCV DNA copy 
number increased 16800 copies/mL seven months after the augmentation of mefloquine. Approximately eight 
months after the initiation of mefloquine, the patient died of pneumonia. The total clinical course of the PML was 
approximately 10 months.  Pathological findings: the autopsy showed moderate atrophy in the frontal, parietal and

temporal lobes. Large diffuse areas of softening and granular lesions were noted in the cerebral white matter on 
horizontal sections of cerebrum, with severe loss of white matter and cystic formation in the left posterior lobe. 
Histopathologically, there were large diffuse are as exhibiting the complete loss of myelin on Hematoxylin and Eosin
-Luxol fast blue (HE-LFB) staining of the cerebral white matter. There were also numerous macrophages containing
myelindevris, as well as bizarre astrocytes. However, no significant infiltration of CD3 or CD8 immunoreactive cells 
was observed. Meanwhile, there were a few small demyelinated lesions in the brainstem and cerebellum, with 
spherical or slightly oval densely eosinophilic oligodendroglial nuclei in the periphery of the demyelinated lesions. In 
some instances, the oligodendroglial nuclei exhibited a diffuse basophilic appearance with chromatin particles. 
These findings were consistent with pathologic changes of PML. The reporter stated that taking into consideration 
the patient's neuropathological findings, extremely high JCV copy number in the CSF during the early clinical 
course and severe lesions on repeated brain MRI examinations, the reporter believed that rituximab-associated 
PML, particularly that originating from NHL, was a very severe disease that might be difficult to treat. Laboratory 
data was updated in the case.
