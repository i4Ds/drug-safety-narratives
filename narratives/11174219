Medically Significant
A medical doctor reported that an unidentified patient on TYSABRI (unknown dose, IV, unknown frequency) for an 
unknown indication from unknown date to unknown date came under suspicion for progressive multifocal 
leukoencephalopathy (PML) (onset unknown).  No testing or treatment was reported.  The outcome for the event 
was unknown. The causality for the event of was unknown.  It was unknown if TYSABRI treatment is ongoing.
Attempts to obtain valid patient identifier(s) were ongoing.
Update 27 May 2015:  The reporting physician provided the following additional information.  The female patient's 
last TYSABRI infusion was on 04 May 2015.  Risk factors for PML included an anti-JCV antibody titer greater than 3
(date of testing not reported), long term treatment [with TYSABRI] "since 2008 at least".  The patient was reported 
as asymptomatic.  A routine surveillance MRI (date of test not reported) showed a new tiny lesion (clarified as MS 
lesion consistent with active disease).  A lumbar puncture (LP) date unknown was negative for JCV DNA via a

commercial lab (lower limit of detection unknown) and positive at 10 copies/mL per (b) (6)  lab (lower limit of detection 
10 copies/ mL).  At the time of this report the patient was residing at home, working, working out, and fully 
functional.  At the time of this report, the TOUCH database indicated that the patient had received a total of 99 
infusions of TYSABRI from 19 Oct 2007 through 04 May 2015.  The patient first developed MS symptoms on 01 
Sep 1998 and was diagnosed with MS on 01 Apr 2004.  Prior MS therapy included Rebif (interferon beta-1a) and 
Copaxone (glatiramer acetate).  Prior immunosuppressive therapy included steroids (NOS).  The patient was not 
enrolled in (b) (6)
Update 10 Jun 2015:  The reporting physician provided the following additional information via office notes and MRI
report. A MRI performed on (b) (6)  revealed a new left frontal small brain lesion, abutting U-fibers with two 
(illegible)... to tell MS exacerbation vs PML apart soley on the basis of MRI scan in a pre-symptomatic patient. The 
patient was asymptomatic and was instructed to present at the emergency room (ER) for a LP.  MRI performed on 
27 May 2015 (compared to (b) (6) ) revealed the following:  No restricted diffusion, intracranial hemorrhage, 
mass effect, midline shift, or extra-axial fluid collection. The ventricles are unchanged in size and configuration. 
There is similar atrophy of the corpus callosum.  Multiple scattered foci of T2 prolongation in the periventricular, 
subcortical, pontine, midbrain and upper cervical spine WM are again noted and are stable in size and configuration
relative to the prior study.  Compared to the most recent prior study, the 2 left frontal subcortical foci of T2 
prolongation which demonstrate associated enhancement on images 27 and 29 of series 8 are unchanged. In 
addition, there is a R frontal subcortical focus of T2 prolongation which demonstrates associated enhancement on 
image 28 of series 8 also unchanged. No new foci of enhancement. IMRPRESSION:  WM disease as described 
above consistent w/demyelinating process and unchanged relative to the prior study. There are 3 stable foci of 
enhancement in the bilateral frontal lobes. The patient tested positive for anti-JCV antibodies on the following dates:
 30 Jul 2012 (index value not provided), 10 Nov 2013 with an index value of 3.47, 13 Jan 2014 with an index value 
of 3.3, 28 Jul 2014 with an index value of 3.42, and 12 Jan 2015 with an index value of 2.85.  The CSF sample 
(previously reported as negative for JCV DNA per local lab) was drawn on 08 May 2015.  The MRI that prompted 
initial suspicion for PML was clarified as taken on (b) (6)  and was performed as part of routine monitoring 
which occurred every 6 months.
Update 23 Jun 2015:  The reporting neurologist provided the following additional information.  The patient first 
developed symptoms of MS in 1998 characterized by dizziness, right facial weakness, diplopia on right lateral gaze,
right sixth nerve palsy, and tingling in left arm, thumb, and foot.  An MRI showed T2 hypointensity, enhancing with 
Gd contrast, at the right ventral caudal pons, approximately 0.5 x 0.7cm, as well as a couple of small areas and 
increased T2 signal in the periventricular white matter of the left parietal frontal region.  Treatment included oral 
prednisone.  In 2002, she had a recurrence of the same episode and an MRI at that time did not show any new 
lesions.  In Apr 2004 the patient developed a feeling of pins and needles in her feet, numbness in her legs and 
lower buttocks, and difficulty with urination.  An MRI on 06 May 2004 showed 2 enhancing lesions in the cervical

spine and 1 enhancing lesion in T10 location.  The patient was subsequently diagnosed with MS and started 
therapy with Rebif.  The patient had two relapses in 2006 and a new cord lesions.  In 2007 the patient had ongoing 
disease activity per MRI and was treated with SoluMEDROL (methylprednisolone) for 6 months.  A repeated MRI 
(date not provided) showed "ongoing MRI activity" and the patient started TYSABRI in Oct 2007.  Laboratory testing
since 2012 (dates not provided) included the following:  white blood cell counts (WBC) of 8.48, 6.98, 7.21, 7.37, and
10.79 (dates, units, and reference ranges not reported), neutrophils of 4.22, 3.03, 4.12, 3.29, and 6.74, and 
lymphocytes included 3.54, 3.34, 2.50, 3.35, and 3.38.  The patient had a follow-up MRI (date and results not 
reported).  The patient remains asymptomatic.  The patient did not receive plasma exchange (PLEX) therapy.
Treatment for the event of suspected PML included mirtazapine.
Update 26 Jun 2015:  The 40 year old patient reported, via a Biogen sponsored program of Monitored Therapy, that
she was diagnosed with PML (presumed in reference to previously reported event of suspect PML) (onset May 
2015).  The patient stated this diagnosis came through a spinal tap (presumed in reference to previously reported 
CSF results).  An MRI from May 2015 also revealed a new lesion (presumed in reference to previously reported 
MRI from (b) (6) ).  The patient states she is asymptomatic.  The event was ongoing.  The consumer did not 
provide a causality assessment.  TYSABRI therapy was discontinued on 04 May 2015.
Update 21 Jul 2015:  The neurologist reported, via a MS TOUCH Prescribing Program Form (TYSABRI Initial 
Discontinuation Questionnaire) that the patient is suspected for PML.  Additionally, since 25 Apr 2015, the patient 
tested positive for anti-JCV antibodies.  No additional information was provided.
