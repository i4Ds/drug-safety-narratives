(b) (6) .This report received from Clinical 
Trial (b) (6)
 EudraCT Number: 2012-000600-15, 
concerned a 72 year old female (Site: (b) (6)  Subject: (b) (6) ) from Germany.
Initial information was processed with additional information received on 29-JAN-2015 and 30-JAN-2015. 
The subject's height was 160 centimeters; and weight was not reported.
The subject's concurrent conditions included: chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) B type diagnosed on 12-AUG-
2008 (RAI stage IV; Binet stage C); and staging in JUN-2014 showed no clinical lymphadenopathy with partial 
remission according to computed tomography (CT), hypertension, atrial fibrillation, secondary immunodeficiency, 
stomach cramps, uterus myomatosis, panaritium of third finger left hand, and allergy to iodine. Her previous 
medical history included: basalioma, herpes zoster, and pneumonia, pleural empyema and sepsis in (b) (6)  The
subject was previously treated with bendamustine and rituximab from 07-JUL-2009 to 02-DEC-2009 for CLL and 
she experienced a partial response. On 09-JUN-2011, she developed disease progression and/or relapse.
At the time of study screening in DEC-2013, results of immunology testing included: positive hepatitis B core 
antibody, negative hepatitis B surface antigen, negative hepatitis B virus viral load, negative hepatitis C antibody, 
immunoglobulin (Ig) A 87 mg/dL, IgG 1165 mg/dL, and IgM 120 mg/dL.
The subject was treated with blinded study medication, ibrutinib or placebo (capsule, oral; batch/lot number: 
4369070; medication kit number: 60331): 420 mg once a day, initiated on 19-DEC-2013 to 27-OCT-2014; 
bendamustine hydrochloride (powder, intravenous): 112 mg once every 29 days, initiated on 19-DEC-2013 to 22-
MAY-2014; and the non-Company investigational medicinal product, rituximab (concentrate for solution for infusion,
intravenous): 800 mg once every 29 days, initiated on 17-DEC-2013 to 21-MAY-2014; all for CLL. Concomitant 
medications included: rivaroxaban for atrial fibrillation.
On (b) (6)  the subject was involved in a car accident.
On (b) (6) , the subject had recurrent vomiting and increasing disorientation and she was admitted to the 
hospital. According to her friend, she was already confused prior to the car accident. On physical examination, the 
subject was disoriented to time; and her heart rate was 108/minute and blood pressure was 184/85. 
Electrocardiogram (EKG) showed an "absolute arrhythmia in the course of ventricular fibrillation" with a heart rate of
100/minute. Chest X-ray compared to 08-DEC-2014 showed improved findings; no infiltration or effusion and

possibly the start of central congestion without peripheral correlation. 
On (b) (6)  cranial CTs showed a finger-shaped edema at right and left "frontobase", most likely due to 
traumatic edema. Neurology was consulted and organic psycho-syndrome caused by traumatic cerebral edema 
was suspected. Echocardiogram showed minimal mitral and tricuspid insufficiency. Result of an unspecified study 
of the brain supplying arteries showed macroangiography of the carotid arteries with medial thickening up to 1.5 
mm plaque in the bulbus caroticus bilaterally without any relevant carotid artery stenosis. On(b) (6)  and (b)(6)
(b) (6)  cranial CTs showed post-traumatic frontal edema; right more than left and without progression. 
On (b) (6)  a ventricular inhibited (VVI) pacemaker implantation was performed for bradycardia-tachycardia 
syndrome. The subject then experienced intermittent asystole with change of position following the procedure.
On (b) (6)  cranial CT showed similar findings compared to (b) (6)  The subject's clinical condition 
worsened and treatment with dexamethasone was ineffective. Due to the fact that her disorientation was prior to 
the car accident and progressive worsening of her condition, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) in 
the course of a JC-viral infection was suspected. Dexamethasone was discontinued and a biopsy was planned. On 
(b) (6)  cranial CT showed previously detected contusion edema both sides mild sized progressive over 
time; moderate edema in cerebellum (left greater than right); no cause for space-consuming lesion as reason for 
edema; and differential diagnosis inflammatory reaction. 
On (b) (6) , (b) (6)  days after initiating and(b)(6)  days after the last dose of ibrutinib/placebo, the subject was 
transferred to a neurological hospital and PML was diagnosed. The event was assessed as toxicity grade 4. A 
cerebrospinal fluid analysis was performed and an extremely high JC polyomavirus (JCV) load was found. 
The subject was initially treated with gentamicin, piperacillin/tazobactam and cotrimoxazole, which were 
discontinued after virology findings were received. She developed pseudomembranous colitis with the detection of 
Clostridium difficle; and then acute renal failure that was difficult to treat. On (b) (6)  electroencephalogram 
(EEG) showed right parieto-frontal slow lesion. On (b) (6)  EEG showed mild general change and 
decelerated activity with bi-frontal deceleration nidus. 
On (b) (6)  the subject death was expected and she was transferred to hospice in an acinetic-mutistic state.
On(b) (6)  the subject died. An autopsy was not performed.
Action taken with ibrutinib/placebo, bendamustine hydrochloride and rituximab was not applicable.

FOIA Case Report Information
The subject's outcome for the PML was fatal. 
The investigator assessed causality for the event of PML as possible for ibrutinib/placebo; not related for 
bendamustine hydrochloride; and very likely for rituximab. 
The investigator considered the event of PML to be unrelated to trial procedure. 
Co-suspect labeling for rituximab and the event of PML was assessed using the United States Prescribing 
Information (USPI) for Rituxan (rituximab) dated 2014.
The treatment assignment information was unblinded for this subject.
This report was serious (death, life-threatening, and hospitalization).
This case, involving the same subject was linked to Manufacturer Report Numbers: 20140204072 and 
Additional information was received from the investigative site on 02-FEB-2015.
This report provided new information; and no changes were made to this report. 
Additional information was received on 18-MAR-2015:
The interim analysis treatment assignment unblinding of study occurred on 18-Mar-2015.
Additional medically important information was received from the investigator on 30-JUN-2015.
The event of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy with onset date of (b) (6)  was now reported as 
recovered on (b) (6) , with recurrence on (b) (6)  with a fatal outcome (hospital discharge date was 
also reported as (b) (6) ).
