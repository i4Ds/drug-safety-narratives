Medically Significant
The treating physician reported that a male patient on TYSABRI (300 mg, IV, QM) for an unspecified indication 
from 2007 to Feb 2014 and enrolled in a Biogen Idec sponsored marketing program of Monitored Therapy 
experienced PML suspicion characterized by behavioral changes (onset unknown).  An MRI performed on an 
unspecified date showed a lesion leading to PML suspicion.  The patient had previously (date not reported) tested 
negative to JCV antibodies and recently (date not reported) tested positive with an index of 3.1. The event of PML 
suspicion characterized by behavioral changes is ongoing. The causality for the event of PML suspicion 
characterized by behavioral changes is unknown.  TYSABRI therapy was withdrawn.
Update 20 Feb 2014: Results of JCV DNA testing performed on 20 Feb 2014 was positive with 50 copies.

FOIA Case Report Information
Update 28 Mar 2014: Additional information received from the treating physician reported that the patient's medical 
history included optic neuritis in 2004 with a second episode in 2007. The patient was placed on TYSABRI 
treatment in 2008 and the last infusion was administered on 07 Jan 2014 (discrepant dates from previous reports). 
The patient was JCV antibody negative in 2011 (exact date unknown) but was positive in Jan 2014 with an index of 
3.145. MRI's performed prior to PML diagnosis were as follows: on 30 Sep 2013, the MRI revealed suspect lesion, 
assessed as not related to PML. On 21 Nov 2013, the MRI revealed a negative diagnosis for PML. On 25 Jan 2014,
the patient presented with changes in behavior. On 07 Feb 2014, and MRI was performed and revealed findings 
compatible to PML. Following the positive JCV DNA testing on 20 Feb 2014, the patient was hospitalized (date not 
provided) and received cortisone and gamma globulin. On(b) (6)  the patient was hospitalized and received 
his  first PLEX treatment on (b) (6)  Another five PLEX sessions were scheduled. The patient's current EDSS
score was assessed to be 2.5, his EDSS score whilst on TYSABRI (date not provided) was zero.
Update 16 Apr 2014: Additional information was received from the treating physician. JCV DNA testing, performed 
on 11 Apr 2014 at (b) (6)  laboratory, revealed positive results (<50 copies). No further information 
was provided. 
Update 24 Sep 2014: The treating physician spontaneously reported that the patient's condition had improved. He 
had only minor speech difficulties for which he received sppech therapy sessions. His current EDSS was 1-1.5. MRI
reports (retrospect and recent) will be provided. The patient had no history of immunosuppressant use and was on 
Avonex prior to TYSABRI therapy. He was started on Copaxone since Apr 2014. No further information was 
provided.
Update 14 Nov 2014: Additional information was reported by the neurologist via MRI reports. MRI on 21 Nov 2013 
was negative for PML. MRI n 07 Feb 2014 (received on 28 Mar 2014) showed findings compatible to PML; full MRI 
report received on 14 Nov 2014 showed several foci of high magnetic signal intensity in the subcortical WM (white 
matter) of the left cerebral hemisphere. In particular, the focus in the subcortical WM of the left temporal lobe, 
which was a new finding from the previous exam, is somewhat larger in this exam, as is another one, in proximity to
that, located immediately above and forwardly thereof in the subcortical WM of the left frontal area, with a diameter 
of about 22 cm. A nearly new finding in this exam is the similar foci in the subcortical WM of the left parietal area 
and behind the splenium of the corpus callosum, to the left of midline. A similar focus, in the convexity of the left 
frontal lobe, in the subcortical WM is also a new finding. Confluent foci of high intensity magnetic signal in the 
subcortical WM of the left temporal lobe from the lower pole of the left temporal lobe to about the level of the lateral 
Sylvius fissure, which are more intense in this exam. These foci do no present enhancement after the IV contrast. 
However, they do not have the features of demyelination foci. These are strongly suspect of PML.  MRI on (b) (6)  
(b) (6)  showed increased dimensions of the foci of pathological magnetic signal in the subcortical WM of the left 
cerebral hemisphere, which do not present the typical features of demyelinating lesions. They therefore raise the

suspicion of PML. MRI on (b) (6)  showed confluent foci of abnormal signal intensity in the subcortical WM of 
the left cerebral hemisphere, consistent with PML. No clear change as compared to the previous exam and no 
contrast enhancement. No imaged findings typical of an IRIS syndrome. MRI on 07 Jul 2014 showed confluent 
elements of increased signal intensity in the T2 and FLAIR sequences within the context of the history of PML have 
increased compared to prior exam, while minimal elements of punctuate contrast enhancement are a new finding. 
The possibility of IRIS is considered likely. The outcome for the event possible IRIS is unknown. The causality for 
the event possible IRIS was not assessed. 
Update 18 Nov 2014: Upon follow-up, the neurologist reported that the patient is "currently" 29 year old but the 
exact birth date was not provided.
Update 20 Nov 2014: Upon internal review, this case is considered to be confirmed for PML based on positive CSF,
radiological evidence, and clinical symptoms.
Update 12 Feb 2015: The neurologist spontaneously reported that the patient was currently at home at the time of 
this report. His Karnofsky score was 100 and his EDSS was 0. PML is considered resolved. The patient's current 
MS therapy is Copaxone (glatiramer).
