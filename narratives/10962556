HYDROCHLORIDE), Coumadin (WARFARIN SODIUM), Ambien (ZOLPIDEM TARTRATE) and Fentanyl patch ( 
FENTANYL).
On an unspecified date prior to 02Feb2015, the subject started taking 5-10 mg Oxycodone HCl CR Tablets (similar 
to NDA 22-272) OXYCODONE HYDROCHLORIDE every four hours as needed for cancer pain.  
On (b) (6) , the subject had been at the university all day for screening assessments to enroll in the study.  The
subject had taken 10 mg Oxycodone at noon, 3 PM and 6 PM due to cancer related pain.  When the subject got 
home she was unable to get out of the car without help and was becoming less responsive/cognitive disturbance.  
The patient was admitted to the hospital.  Work Up scans showed no evidence of stroke, intracranial hemorrhage, 
infection or renal failure.  Hospital staff believed the subject inadvertently overdosed due to increased pain 
secondary to the above normal activity during the day.  The subject received no treatments and was discharged the
next day on (b) (6) .  The subjectt experienced the reported events prior to receiving the first study drug 
administration.  
The action taken with Oxycodone was no change.  The patient recovered from the reported events.
The reporting pharmacist considered the events experienced cognitive disturbance and overdosed on opiate 
medication to be related to the suspect drug, but did not  relate the event of increased pain to the suspect drug but 
instead to the above normal amount of activity.. 
This case was rated to be serious as it involved in-patient hospitalization.
Additional information can not be requested.
***Upon internal review on 29Jul2015, the case type was updated from non-company study to spontaneous as 
oxycodone was a suspect concomitant medication, and not a study comparator drug. The initial narrative has been 
updated to reflect spontaneous report type.
