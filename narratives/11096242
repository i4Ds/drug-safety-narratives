Medically Significant
A hospital nurse spontaneously reported via a Biogen employee that a 43 year old male patient treated on 
TYSABRI (300 mg, IV, QM) for Multiple Sclerosis from unknown date to 30 Dec 2014 was hospitalized from (b)(6)  or 
(b) (6)  to an unknown date for PML suspicion (onset (b) (6) ).  The patient experienced worsening in 
cognitive disorders, paraparesis, gait disorders, and bladder-sphincter disorders. The patient had received a total of
56 TYSABRI infusions, the last one being performed on 30 Dec 2014. Decision of stopping the treatment was due 
to positive JCV serology with high index (5.85), exact date of the test not mentioned. Prior MS treatments were not 
provided. Gilenya (fingolimod) was then started on 12 Feb 2015. On 04 Mar 2015, brain MRI was performed 
(reason not provided) which was found unremarkable (no PML suspicion). Brain MRI performed on (b) (6)
led to suspect PML (NOS). Lumbar puncture was performed on (b)(6)  or 
(b) (6)  for JCV PCR testing (CSF sent 
to (b) (6)  and to a French laboratory), results still pending.   No treatment was reported. At the time of reporting, 
the patient was not well at all. The event of PML suspicion is ongoing. The causality for the event of PML suspicion 
was assessed as related.  TYSABRI therapy was previously discontinued.  No other information was provided.
French imputability: C2 S2 I2
Update 08 Apr 2015:  A neurologist spontaneously reported that the patient died on (b) (6)  in the morning. An 
autopsy will be performed on (b) (6) . No further information was provided. French Imputability: C1 S1 I1
Update 22 Apr 2015:  An update was received from the French Health Authorities ANSM (registry # ST20150315) 
on the 43 year old male patient.  The patient experienced "slowdown of fine motor skills", "dysarthria", 
"paraparesis", "positive test to JC virus", and "progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy".  TYSABRl therapy was 
started on 08 Oct 2010 and discontinued on 30 Dec 2014 due to treatment duration greater than 2 years and 
positive JC virus serology with index value greater than 1.5 (at 2.585) (index value discrepant).  Treatment was 
switched to Gilenya on 12 Feb 2015 and stopped on 04 Mar 2015.  In early Mar 2015 the patient's motor weakness 
of the right lower limb worsened, however the patient's EDSS remained stable at 5.  The patient also experienced 
marked worsening with idomotor slowing, dysarthria, paraparesis, and MRI showing lesions [suspicious for] PML.
A lumbar puncture (LP) showed no cells, proteinorachy at 1.45 G/L, and JCV DNA results were pending.  A brain 
MRI on 28 Jan 2015 showed non-specific right frontal hyperintense signal that was not present prior to treatment 
switch.  A repeat MRI on 04 Mar 2015 showed the signal was still present and suspicion for PML was raised.  The 
patient's neurological picture has improved slightly.  Subsequently the patient had aspiration pneumonia, sepsis, 
and death.
French Imputability:  C1 S2 I1 B4
Update 10 May 2015:  The reporting neurologist provided the following additional information.  The patient had not 
experienced any interruption of TYSABRl therapy for greater than 3 months.  Prior MS therapy included AVONEX.

FOIA Case Report Information
The patient first developed symptoms of MS in Dec 2004 and was diagnosed with MS in Oct 2006.  MS disease 
symptoms prior to PML included ataxic-pyramidal syndrome and cognitive disorders (EDSS of 5; date of evaluation 
not reported) with cognitive slowdown and dysexecutive syndrome, multifocal motor symptoms (moderate 
deficiency of the right lower limb) and focal sensory symptoms of the right lower limb.  The patient tested positive 
for serum anti-JCV antibody on 08Dec2011 and on 10Oct2012 with an Index Value at 2.585.  The patient died on 
(b) (6)  from purulent bilateral pulmonary disease.  Additionally, the patient had signs of septic shock with no 
fever, vital signs and lab tests (NOS) were normal.  However, the patient had atelectasis of the right lung with 
inflammation in the blood that persisted despite antibiotics (NOS) and fibroaspirations.  An autopsy was performed 
on (b) (6)  at the time of this report results were pending.  The neurologist assessed the patient's death as 
related to TYSABRI as aspiration bronchopneumopathy was due to PML.  The neurologist stated that an MRI was 
done on (b) (6)  after the patient presented 04 Mar 2015 with cognitive slowdown (but coherent), paraplegia 
with full deficit of right lower limb and partial deficiency of the left lower limb, multifocal sensory symptoms, and 
fatigue.  The MRI from (b) (6)  showed inflammatory demyelinating plaque in the cerebral region that 
appeared as FLAIR hypersignal and had significantly spread; it was localized in the subcortical upper right frontal 
area and the U-fibers were also affected.  Multiple punctiform and nodular lesions also appeared in T2 FLAIR in the
right semi-oval center, right insula, right anterior temporal-polar region, pons, and two cerebellar hemispheres.  In 
the medullary region, there were multiple demyelinating lesions, non Gd-enhanced, mainly located in the vertebral 
bodies D3-D4 and D5.  The rapid extension of subcortical demyelinating plaques spread up to the U-fibers and the 
emergency of multiple foci of demyelination and diffuse Gd-enhanced lesions led to a strong suspicion of PML.
Prior MRIs from 09 Oct 2014, 28 Jan 2015, and 04 Mar 2015 revealed suspicious punctiform Gd enhanced lesions.
 The brain MRI from 28 Jan 2015 (compared to MRI from 14 Feb 2014) showed FLAIR non-specific subcortical 
hyperintense signal of the right frontal convexity and a punctiform right frontal subcortical contrast enhancement.
The brain MRI from 04 Mar 2015 showed subcortical upper right frontal hyperintense signal (unchanged) reaching 
the U-fibers in some places.  Few punctiform enhancements in the right semi-oval center were observed (likely 
related to non-specific vascular contract enhancement).  Two demyelinating plaques were also observed; one in the
left semi-oval center and one in the pons, paramedian right.  There was a discrete contrast enhancement of the 
punctiform lesion in the pons.  It was clarified that the lumbar puncture (LP) was performed on 19 mar 2015.  The 
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was negative for JCV DNA from CERBA labs (lower level of detection unknown), was 
inconclusive ("the result of the sample was below the limit of detection and therefore 'not detected' although positive
for JCV DNA amplification when inspected manually") for JCV DNA from (b) (6)  (lower level of detection 
unknown), and was positive for JCV DNA from a local lab at 1750 copies/mL.  Further CSF analysis was significant 
for 1 WBC/mm3 and protein at 1.45G/L.  Other testing at the time of PML suspicion on (b) (6)  included an 
absolute leukocyte count of 11070/mm3 (reference range 4 to 10000) and absolute lymphocyte count of 310/mm3 
(reference range 1500 to 4000).
