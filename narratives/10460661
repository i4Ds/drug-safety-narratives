A neurologist reported that a 37 year old female patient on TYSABRI (300 mg, IV, QM) for relapsing remitting 
Multiple Sclerosis from an unknown date in 2010 to an unknown date Apr 2013 experienced weight loss (onset Feb 
2013), urinary tract infection (onset Apr 2013), somnolence, walking weakness, persistent dizziness, nausea 
tendency, vomiting tendency, diffuse demyelinating lesions, and cerebral atrophy (onsets 07 Jul 2013).  On 07 Jul 
2013, the patient underwent an MRI, which showed diffuse demyelinating lesions, cerebral atrophy, and no 
gadolinium enhancing lesions.  Treatment is unknown.  The outcome for the events weight loss, diffuse 
demyelinating lesions, and cerebral atrophy is unknown. The event of urinary tract infection is resolved. The events 
of somnolence, walking weakness, persistent dizziness, nausea tendency, and vomiting tendency are ongoing. 
Causality for the events nausea tendency and vomiting tendency was assessed as unknown.  The causality for the

remaining events was not assessed.  It was noted that a CSF sample would be obtained in order to perform JCV 
antibodies testing.  TYSABRI therapy was discontinued for unknown reasons.
Update 12 Jul 2013: The same neurologist re-reported that the female patient on TYSABRI experienced weight 
loss (onset Feb 2013), urinary tract infection (onset Apr 2013), somnolence, walking weakness, persistent 
dizziness, nausea tendency and vomiting tendency  (onsets 07 Jul 2013).  Treatment is unknown.   The patient 
tested positive for the JCV antibody test on 11 Jul 2013.  Causality for the events nausea tendency and vomiting 
tendency was assessed as unknown.  The causality for the remaining events was not assessed.  TYSABRI therapy
was discontinued for unknown reasons.
Addendum on Update 12 Jul 2013: It was discovered on 16 Sep 2014 the patient's JCV results were misreported. It
was previously reported that "The patient tested positive for the JCV antibody test on 11 Jul 2013." However, 
laboratory test results received on 12 Jul 2013 actually indicated that the patient's CSF sample collected on 08 Jul 
2013 and tested on 11 Jul 2013 tested JCV DNA PCR positive at < 50 copies. The event of PML (onset 07 Jul 
2013) has been added to the case.
Update 08 Sep 2014: A report was received via the literature: Karageorgiou CE, Giannouli E, Kargadou A, 
Athanasouli A, Emanouil G. Late onset PML in a natalizumab-treated MS patient. 30th Congress of the European 
Committee for Treatment and Research in Multiple Sclerosis (ECTRIMS) held jointly with the 19th Annual Meeting

Conference of the Latin-American Committee for Treatment and Research in Multiple Sclerosis (LACTRIMS). 
P870. A medical doctor reported that the 37 year old female, diagnosed with MS in 2002, received interferon-b1a 
for eight years. Due to a high number of relapses (MCN 2014BI094388), TYSABRI was initiated and the patient's 
condition stabilized for 2.5 years (EDSS = 5, date unknown). However, the drug (presume TYSABRI) had to be 
discontinued temporarily because of recurrent urinary infections. The patient's condition was stable for three 
months after TYSABRI discontinuation and she only complained of extreme fatigue (presumed symptom of PML) 
and weight loss. A brain MRI at this point (date unknown) only showed lesions compatible with MS. Three and a 
half months after TYSABRI discontinuation the patient exhibited marked deterioration with vomiting, vertigo, 
horizontal nystagmus and ataxia (presumed symptoms of PML). A repeat brain MRI (previously reported MRI was 
performed on 07 Jul 2013) showed a non-enhancing lesion in both cerebellar penduncles compatible with PML and 
CSF analysis (previously reported as JCV PCR test performed on 11 Jul 2013) showed 150 JCV copies. The 
patient received high dose of corticosteroids (NOS) and IVIG with initial improvement; however the patient showed 
deterioration later on, both clinically and on the MRI, (spreading of the lesion in the brainstem; date unknown). The 
patient received further corticosteroid treatment (NOS), both IV and oral, as well as immunomodulatory treatment 
with glatiramer acetate.  Approximately 8 months later the patient's condition has stabilized with moderate 
improvement (EDSS = 7, date unknown). Plasma exchange was not employed as the drug (presume TYSABRI)

was considered to have been eliminated from the patient's body. Repeat MRIs (date unknown) showed gradual 
improvement of the lesion and at no point was lesion enhancement detected which would be indicative of immune 
reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS).
Update 12 Sep 2014: A report was received via the poster: Karageorgiou CE, Giannouli E, Kargadou A, 
Athanasouli A, and Emanouil G. Late onset PML in a natalizumab-treated MS patient. Poster presented at the 30th 
Congress of the European Committee for Treatment and Research in Multiple Sclerosis (ECTRIMS) held jointly 
with the 19th Annual Meeting of the Americas Committee for Treatment and Research in Multiple Sclerosis 
(ACTRIMS) and 2014 Annual Conference of the Latin-American Committee for Treatment and Research in Multiple
Sclerosis (LACTRIMS) on 12 Sep 2014. The patient?s MRI images (presumed from Jul 2013) were included on the
poster in addition to the abstract information that was previously reported on Update 08 Sep 2014. No additional 
information was provided. 
Update 24 Sep 2014: The neurologist reported via a Biogen Idec sponsored program of Monitored Therapy that the
female patient received an unspecified number of TYSABRI infusions from 2010 to Apr 2013. Prior to TYSABRI the
patient was on Avonex (interferon beta 1a) for 8 years. The patient had been tested once for JCV antibodies (date 
unknown) and was positive. The neurologist noted that for the treatment of PML, the patient received gamma 
globulin and high dose intravenous cortisone. The patient did not receive PLEX for PML. The neurologist stated that
the patient is currently residing at home and her current EDSS is approximately 7.  The patient currently receives 
Copaxone (glatiramer acetate) for MS though the neurologist indicated that the patient is not doing very well 
conforming to the dosing regimen. No further information was provided.
Update 25 Sep 2014: Upon internal review, Biogen Idec considers this case to be confirmed for PML based on 
positive JCV DNA, consistent detailed MRI findings, and clinical symptoms present.
Update 20 Oct 2014: Information was received via a meeting abstract (M1708) from the 139th Annual Meeting of 
the American Neurological Association (ANA), Baltimore, MD. Karageorgiou CE, Giannouli E, Garifalia E, 
Athanasouli A, Kargadou A, and Tagaris G. Uncommon Infratentorial Localisation of PML in Natalizumab-Treated 
MS Patients. Annals of Neurology. 2014; 76 (S18): S109-S110.The authors reported 3 patients with an EDSS under
TYSABRI treatment of 2.5-5, TYSABRI treatment longer than 2 years, without prior immunosuppression, and only 
infratentorial localization of PML lesions. This case refers to a female patient with relapsing remitting Multiple 
Sclerosis initially treated with interferon (NOS) who received 30 infusions of TYSABRI. The patient's EDSS was 5 
(date unknown). The patient eventually presented with cerebellar symptoms after a period of extreme fatigue. In 
this patient, the disease appeared three months after TYSABRI discontinuation. MRI showed PML cerebellar 
lesions with quick spread in the brainstem. The patient received standard anti-PML treatment (NOS) with a final 
EDSS (date unknown) of 7-7.5 (presume reference to previously reported EDSS score of 7). Conclusions: Rare

infratentorial PML localization appeared after long-term TYSABRI treatment in patients without any prior 
immunosuppression. The disease was more severe and its course more indolent than other reported PML cases. 
Finally, the risk of PML still exists even three months after TYSABRI discontinuation.
