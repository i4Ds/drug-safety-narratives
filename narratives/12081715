This spontaneous report was received from the mother of a 4 year old Caucasian male regarding Ibuprofen 20 
mg/mL Child Grape and Berry Suspensions. The child had undergone a tonsillectomy in SEP2015 and was advised
by his physician to take alternating doses of ibuprofen and acetaminophen for pain. In SEP2015, the mother began 
giving the child 7.5 mL of Ibuprofen 20 mg/mL Child Berry Suspension as needed, alternated with doses of 
Childrens Tylenol and nonPerrigo childrens acetaminophen. Each time the Ibuprofen 20 mg/mL Child Berry 
Suspension was administered, the child would experience a burning sensation to his throat and crying. The mother 
noted that the child would let some of the medication come out of his mouth and then after a couple of minutes he 
would drink water and the burning sensation and crying would resolve. In SEP2015, the mother stopped trying to 
give the child the Ibuprofen 20 mg/mL Child Berry Suspension and instead began giving him 7.5 mL every six hours
as needed of the Ibuprofen 20 mg/mL Child Grape Suspension. However, each time the child received the 
Ibuprofen 20 mg/mL Child Grape Suspension, he again experienced a burning sensation to his throat and crying; 
the events again resolved after a couple minutes with drinking water. The mother discontinued use of the product 
on 13SEP2015, after which the burning sensation and crying completely resolved. The mother noted that the child 
had used both products on previous unspecified dates without experiencing any issues. The child has no known 
drug allergies. No further information is expected.
