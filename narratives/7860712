hydrochloride, benzonatate, transfusion with packed red blood cells, and oxycodone. On 11May06 the patient 
received the first, and only pemetrexed (Alimta) 685 mg treatment for NSCLC. 0411111111.the patient presented 
to the hospital with a five day history of diarrhea, anorexia, dehydration, increased weakness, shortness of breath, 
and cough. On days since last receiving pemetrexed, the patient was admitted with diarrhea grade 3 
resulting in deh ration grade 3, pneumonia grade 4 (indicated as life-threatening), and shortness of breath 
resulting in hypoxia grade 5. Chest x-ray detected a large left pleural effusion. Electrocardiogram detected atrial 
fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. The patient received loperamide hydrochloride and intravenous fluids. 
On elliftan abdominal x-ray was flat and upright with no obstruction. Aspiration of the pleural cavity was 
performed: 1500 ml of blood tinged fluid was removed. On an. patient developed neutropenia grade 4 
(indicated as life-threatening). On chest x-ray revealed left and right pleural effusion with ill defined 
consolidation noted in left base. Lab results: white blood cell count 0.9, hemoglobin 10.8, platelets 89, neutrophils 
15% and bands 1%. On ithe patient died. Cause of death was hypoxia related to probable pneumonia. 
Neutropenia and pneumonia were considered not recovered at the time of death. An autopsy was not performed.

related to pemetrexed; and neutropenia was definitely related to pemetrexed. No relatedness opinion for protocol 
procedures was provided. Hypoxia was related to pneumonia. Update 24Mar2011: Non-med sig edit. Upon review
