AER 1498948, is a clinical case, received on 26/Nov/2014, from a hematologist and concerns a 67 year old male 
patient (patient number:(b) (6) ) who developed progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy while enrolled in 
(b) (6)
(b) (6)
The patient's concurrent conditions included atrial fibrillation, hypertension, pneumonia, hyperuricemia, 
hypercholesterolemia, cardiomyopathy, sleep apnea and chronic venous insufficiency. Concomitant medications 
included bemiparin sodium, captopril, omeprazole, levofloxacin, candesartan cilexetil, 
sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim, allopurinol, atorvastatin calcium, propranolol hydrochloride, acenocoumarol, 
paracetamol, dexchlorpheniramine, ondansetron, cefuroxime, cloperastine, budesonide, acetylcysteine, enalapril, 
sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim, carvedilol and hydrochlorothiazide. The patient did not have a history of 
immunodeficiency, chronic viral infection, bone marrow or solid bone transplant, herpes simplex, herpes zoster, 
history of opportunistic infection, CMV pneumocystic carinii pneumonia and known CNS pathology (CNS lupus or 
CNS lymphoma). No past drugs were reported.
On 10/Jun/2013, the patient started therapy with intravenous rituximab 375 mg/m2 (induction therapy in cycle 1) 
(batch/lot number B6205). On 12/Jun/2013, the infusion with intravenous rituximab was completed. On 08/Jul/2013,
he started therapy with subcutaneous rituximab 1400 mg every 3 weeks (batch/lot number PT1036H02A). He 
received the subcutaneous rituximab on the following dates: 05/Aug/2013, 05/Sep/2013, 30/Sep/2013, 
28/Oct/2013, 25/Nov/2013, 27/Dec/2013, 24/Feb/2014, 21/Apr/2014, 18/Jun/2014, 11/Aug/2014 and 06/Oct/2014 
(patient had received 12 cycles by the time of event onset). On 06/Oct/2014, he recived last dose of sc rituximab. 
On 22/Nov/2014, he experienced symptoms of possibly progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy. On 
(b) (6)  he was admitted to the emergency room with progressive increase in 2- 3 days of evolution of feeling 
bad, low mood, confused speech, disorientation, without headache or nausea or vomiting or fever, Patient had bad 
general status, incoherent language and inappropriate laughter. On the same day, his computerized tomogram 
(CT) scan was performed which showed focal hypodense lesion located in the white matter of the left frontal lobe 
with mass effect. The therapy with subcutaneous rituximab was temporarily stopped. On (b) (6)  he 
underwent brain nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (MRI scan) which showed multifocal lesions in the white 
matter. The patient was stable. On (b) (6)  his brain biopsy was performed which was positive for 
encephalopathy. The final diagnosis was confirmed as progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (grade 3). No 
treatment was required for the event. On (b) (6)  the event of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy 
was resolved with sequelae and he was discharged from the hospital. On 09/Dec/2014, therapy with subcutaneous 
rituximab was permanently discontinued. It was reported, that the patient did not complete the study and therapy 
was discontinued due to the progression of disease. On 30/Dec/2014, brain MRI was not done. It was reported that 
patient have not stored serum sample available that was drawn within the previous 5 years of event onset.

FOIA Case Report Information
The hematologist assessed the causal relationship for the event of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy as 
related with intravenous rituximab and subcutaneous rituximab. 
No further information was provided.
This confirmed case of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) is being expedited per 
Roche/Genentech Enhanced Pharmacovigilance Plan for PML
Additional information received on 28/Nov/2014, following information was added to the case; batch lot number of 
rituximab SC (PT1036H02A), lab diagnostic (MRI scan), event description.
Additional information received on 01/Dec/2014, following information was added to the case: The dose of 
rituximab, start dates of subcutaneous rituximab and event description.
Additional information was received on 02/Dec/2014 and was added to the case,  Dose of intravenous rituximab 
was updated (previously reported as 836mg), batch/lot number for intravenous rituximab (B6205), outcome of brain
mass was updated (previously reported as persisting),  the brain biopsy was pending and the patient was stable, 
laboratory test (biopsy), it was reported that final diagnosis for the event brain mass was possibly 
leukoencephalopathy but biopsy result was pending, reporter causality was updated (previously reported as 
unrelated to study drug but related to pre-existing condition follicular lymphoma).
