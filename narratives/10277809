Medically Significant
A neurologist spontaneously reported that a 72 year old female patient on TYSABRI (300 mg, IV, QM) for relapsing 
remitting Multiple Sclerosis since 01 Apr 2010 experienced PML suspicion (onset 16 Jun 2014).  The patient was 
diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis in 2006. Testing included a three month routine brain MRI from 16 Jun 2014 
which showed a lesion in the left occipital, seen only on DIR (double inversion recovery) neither on T2, nor on T1 
with or without GD+. The patient is also JCV antibody positive with an index of 2.0 and a lumbar puncture is 
scheduled for 23 Jun 2014. No treatment was reported. The outcome for the event PML suspicion is unknown. The 
causality for the event of PML suspicion was assessed as related.  TYSABRI therapy continues.
Update 24 Jun 2014: Additional information was received from the neurologist via Biogen Idec employee (MSL).

FOIA Case Report Information
The CSF sample is expected to arrive at (b) (6)  on 26 Jun 2014; the results of the patient's lumbar puncture is still
pending. Routine lab testing (NOS) did not show any deviations, 4/3 leuco's (presumed leukocytes) TE 0.58 g/l (to 
be clarified on follow-up). No further details were provided. 
Update 27 Jun 2014: Additional information was received from the neurologist. The neurologist stated the patient is 
currently doing well and lumbar puncture results are still pending from (b) (6)  laboratories. The MRI images were 
assessed by a neuroradiologist from the (b) (6)  who agreed the MRI appears to be PML. Treatment was initiated 
with PLEX with a second round occurring on 27 Jun 2014. Mefloquine was initiated at 250mg three days a week 
and then 250 mg weekly until IRIS starts. The patient was initiated on Metrozapine (presumed Mirtazapine) at 15 
mg (unknown frequency) which will be up-titrated to 60 mg (unknown frequency). No further details were provided. 
Update 01 Jul 2014: The neurologist reported the patient's date of birth and initials were initially reported incorrectly.
The correct date of birth and initials were provided. No further details were provided. 
Update 02 Jul 2014: Additional information was received from the neurologist. On 25 Jun 2014, the patient noticed 
a change in her visual field. On 27 Jun 2014, an eye specialist confirmed right sided parietal homonyme 
hemianopsie with 50% visual field loss on the right side.  Next MRI is planned for next week.  The patient's last 
plasmapheresis treatment was on 02 Jul 2014.
Update 07 Jul 2014: Additional information was received from (b) (6)  and the neurologist. According 
to the neurologist, the patient received 4 rounds of plasmapheresis.   After 4 rounds, the saturation level of 
natalizmab was below the reported level from Coyle et al's publication (MD does not remember the specific level) 
so they decided to stop after 4 rounds of plex. Since the last PLEX, the patient had a slightly elevated temperature 
of 38 degrees Celsius and elevated leucocytes of 19.5 (units not provided) (normal value = 11.0) CSF JCV PCR 
results from (b) (6)  returned positive (1477 copies/ml).  
Update 10 Jul 2014: Upon internal review, PML has been confirmed in this case based on MRI findings, positive 
CSF, and clinical symptoms.
Update 24 Jul 2014: A healthcare professional spontaneously reported additional information.  MRI performed on 
11 Jul 2014 showed growth of the lesion with no enhancement.  MRI performed on 21 Jul 2014 showed no change 
compared with 11 Jul 2014.  The patient was scheduled to undergo MRI on 31 Jul 2014.
Update 27 Jul 2014:  The neurologist spontaneously clarified that the routine lab of the CSF did not show any 
deviations with leucocytes of 4/3 (ULN = 10/3) and total protein (TE) of 0.58 g/l (ULN = 0.60 g/l).  The patient is 
doing well in general.  The visual field deficit, confirmed as right-sided partial homonyme hemianopia (loss of 50%

in het visual field right sided) appears to be resolving and the patient is feeling good. Following PLEX, the patient 
felt tired and blew up, however currently she is slim again and no longer needs an afternoon nap. Following an 
initial increase of lesion size seen on the MRI of 11 Jul 2014, the latest MRIs (dates unspecified) showed a 
decrease of the lesion's size and no Gd+ enhancement.
Update 09 Sep 2014: Additional information was provided by the neurologist. The patient experienced visual 
impairment and confusion during PLEX.  After 4 PLEX sessions, TYSABRI concentration was very low at 1pg/mmol
in serum and as a result, in agreement with (b) (6)  a 5th PLEX was not initiated.  After PLEX, the patient had one 
seizure resulting in confusion, concentration and imprinting's disorder, and phatic problems. A month later (date not
provided), a MRI showed evidence of IRIS. The patient was treated with a weekly three-day course of 
methylprednisolone 1000 mg daily. After four repeat MRIs, volume reduction of lesions were noted with only 
discrete residual staining (presumed in reference to previously reported MRIs).  Clinically, the patient is no longer 
confused, cognition has improved, and vision expands again. The patient has hardly any motor problems and 
speech is good.  The patient seems to have made the turn.  MRI control is maintained. Mefloquine and mirtazapine 
has been discontinued. MRI Images will be provided.
Update 10 Oct 2014:  Additional information was provided by the neurologist.  The patient deteriorated suddenly 
last week and went blind on 07 Oct 2014 (presume symptom).  An MRI was performed which showed MS 
reactivation, but in the region of the PML and PML-IRIS.  The patient received another course of 
methylprednisolone from 08 Oct 2013 to 10 Oct 2014.  The patient's sight was returning slowly and she was able to 
identify light and some coloring. No further information provided.  No further information provided.
Update 20 Oct 2014: Additional information was received from the neurologist via an MS Standardized PML Data 
Collection Tool. The patient started TYSABRI on 03 Dec 2009 (discrepant from previous report). The neurologist 
assessed the patient?s estimated Karnofsky and EDSS scores as follows: 70 (cares for self; unable to carry on 
normal activity or to do active work) and 4 in 2009 prior to starting TYSABRI; 80 (normal activity with effort; some 
signs or symptoms of disease) and 3 in May 2014; and 80 and 3 in Jun 2014. The patient tested positive for serum 
anti-JCV antibodies in May 2013.  Leukocyte count in Jan 2009, prior to starting TYSABRI was 5.17 x10(9)/L 
(normal range 4 to 11).  Testing on 05 Jul 2013 revealed the following: leukocyte count 8.4 x10(9)/L, and 
lymphocyte count 3.7 x 10(9)/L (normal range: 1 - 4).  On 16 Jun 2014 leukocyte count was 10.4 x10(9)/L. A lumbar
puncture was performed on 23 Jun 2014 and was positive for CSF JCV DNA at 1477 copies per mL (previously 
reported).
The patient was diagnosed with IRIS, which was determined by clinical symptoms and MRI findings. Onset date of 
clinical symptoms was 11 Aug 2014 and included decline in comprehension and imprinting (cognitive/behavioral) 
and late progressing quadrant anopsia (visual). The patient did not receive corticosteroids pre-IRIS onset, but

received corticosteroids post-IRIS onset. Treatment for IRIS included mefloquine 250 mg PO weekly, started 27 
Jun 2014, mirtazapine 15 mg PO daily started 27 Jun 2014, and methylprednisolone 1000 mg IV 3 days per week 
four times, started on 11 Aug 2014. The patient did not receive methylprednisolone for two weeks, and then the 
treatment was tapered two times. An MRI was performed on 04 Sep 2014 and on 03 Oct 2014 (results not yet 
provided). Currently, the patient is alive and is in the hospital. The outcome of the event of PML and IRIS was 
unknown. Causality for the event of PML was assessed as related to TYSABRI, with the primary cause being JCV 
positivity in CSF.  Causality for the event of IRIS was assessed as unrelated to TYSABRI as it was due to "immune 
reconstitution".
Update 21 Feb 2015: Additional information was received from the neurologist via a Standardized PML Data 
Collection Tool and email. The patient is alive, residing at home, and is not currently on any MS therapy. The 
patient was seen in the outpatient clinic on 20 Feb 2014 (presume 20 Feb 2015) and clinically the patient has 
improved remarkably, has a positive mind, notices improvement on multiple areas: increased memory, better 
imprinting, increased visual, is reading, assessing time (on a clock), and can watch TV. Speech has more or less 
normalized.  The neurologist assessed the patient's estimated Karnofsky and EDSS scores on 20 Feb 2015 to be 
60 (Requires occasional assistance, but is able to care for most of his personal needs) and 3. A brain MRI was 
performed on 16 Feb 2015 which showed less white matter lesion load and decreased enhancing. Test results on 
18 Feb 2015, post-PML, include leukocyte count 7.2 X10(9)/L (normal range: 4.0-12.0), lymphocyte count of 2.2 
X10(9)/L (normal range: 1.0-4.0), and chemistry, TSH, T4 all within normal limits. The patient has developed IRIS 
determined by clinical symptoms and MRI findings. Clinical symptoms included multifocal seizure (single tonic-
clonic seizure, levetiracetam 2 dd (presume 2 doses daily) 500 mg started, no seizures afterwards) (onset 04 Aug 
2014) and cognitive/behavioral (memory, orientation, dyspraxia), speech (nonfluency, expressive aphasia) and 
visual (cortical blindness) (onsets 14 Aug 2014).  The patient did not receive corticosteroids pre-IRIS onset and did 
receive corticosteroids post-onset. Treatment for IRIS included methylprednisolone 500 mg IV three times per week
from 14 Aug 2014 to 06 Nov 2014. As of 20 Feb 2015, the patient has recovered from PML and was recovering 
from IRIS. Causality for the events was assessed as related to TYSABRI.   The neurologist noted that IRIS was 
provoked by PEX.
Update 20 May 2015:  Follow-up information received included MRI images from 31 Oct 2014, 28 Nov 2014, 09 Jan
2015, 16 Feb 2015, and 20 Apr 2015 (results for MRI image from 16 Feb 2015 was previously reported; results of 
other MRI images were not provided).  No further information was provided.
