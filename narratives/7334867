was suffering from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPE)). He had a smoking habit (40 cigarettes per day 
for 50 years). He was diagnosed with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) stage IV with lung metastases. lie did 
not receive arty chemotherapy, surgery, radiotherapy or any other therapies for NSCLC. He concomitantly received

FOtA Case Report Information 
A computerised tomogram (CT) thorax on 26-Nov-2007 showed tachetic reticular shadow predominantly 
in both and upper lobe_ Before receiving pemetrexed, emphysematous lung was observed and interstitial 
shadows Nice swiss cheese appearance were seen around the tumor. Tachetic reticular shadow in both middle and 
upper lobe was not observed at that time. On 10-Aug-2009, the CT showed interstitial shadows in right upper lobe. 
On 09-Sep-2009, a X-ray showed no -      9   alitie.s. On 11-Nov-2009, lab data was as follows: oxygen saturation 
(Sp02) 96%, partial arteriat pressure of oxygen (Pa02) and partial arterial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) 
39.3%. The patient received pemetrexed disodium (Alirnta) 800 mg intravenously for large cell lung cancer as first 
line  a s  on 11.-Nov-2009. On the same day, he developed-inflammatory reaction and received levoitaxan. Lab 
data was as follows: white blood cell count (WBC) 641.0/mm3, neutrophil count (Neut) 4070/mm3, platelet count 
(Pit) 1.080001mm3, aspartate arninotransferase (AST) 24 ILI/I, alanine arninotransferase (ALT) 20 lUll, lactate

On the same day, hisAST increased to 34 ILA On 20-Nov-2009, 10 days after the administration of pemetrexed, 
his ALT Increased to 52 lUff (non-serious). On platelets infusion was performed. On 22-Nov-2009, he 
recovered from the Neut decrease (Pit 8 ..# -0:t  -    3 and Neut 2475/mm3). On 26-Nov-2009, cephozopran

26-Nov-2007 a  nnoott   be ruled out. The investigator did not know if RI decrease was related to pemetrexed but 
r to DIC. The causality assessment of Neut decrease was not provided. Further information was requested. 
Updated  24-Mar-2010: Added the serious events of interstitial pneumonitis, platelets decrease and neutrophil 
count decrease. Added the patient demographics, concomitant medications, details of DIC, tab data and 
investigator's opinion. Changed the event onset date and outcome of DIC. Updated the narrative and relevant 
fieida. Updated on 25-May-2010: Additional information was received on 20-May-2010: Hypoaibuminaemia was 
add as a serious event. Lab data was added. Dosage regimen of concomitant medication was changed: The 
repOrted causality of IP was changed from unknown.to yes. Narrative was updated. Updated on 03-Jun-201D: 
Additional information was received on 20-May-2010: Added the lab data and treatment information. Updated the 
narrative and relevant fields. Update on 30-Jun-2010: Additional information received from the study investigator 
on 21-Jun-2010. Deleted the event of hypoalbuminaernia which was downgraded from serious to non-serious.
