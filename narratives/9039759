A hospital neurologist spontaneously reported that a 51 year old female patient, on TYSABRI (300 mg, IV, QM), 
from an unknown date to Sep 2012 was suspected of possible progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML; 
onset mid Sep 2012). Indication for TYSABRI was Multiple Sclerosis diagnosed on an unknown date. At the time of 
the event, the patient had received a total of 22 doses of TYSABRI. Prior IS history, JCV antibody status, and 
concomitant medications were unknown.
In the beginning of Sep 2012, the patient presented with arm paralysis. An MRI was performed at that time and the 
patient's primary neurologist (from a private practice) diagnosed the paralysis as an "MS relapse" and treated the

patient with unspecified treatment. The patient then proceeded to receive the scheduled Sep 2012 infusion. In mid 
Sep 2012, the patient was seen by a hospital neurologist (reporter) and PML was suspected. The patient underwent
a lumbar puncture and CSF was tested for JCV DNA and returned negative from two local labs (in (b) (6)  and in 
(b) (6) ). Plasma exchange was not administered due to fear of IRIS.
Repeat MRI from 14 Nov 2012 confirmed the suspicion of PML. At the time of report, the patient's symptoms are 
not affecting the hand but are more or less stable. The hospital neurologist also noted that this case was discussed 
with three Swiss specialists. A new CSF sample had been sent to (b) (6)  for JCV testing.
The hospital neurologist did not provide a causality assessment for the event of suspected PML. The event is 
ongoing. TYSABR therapy was permanently discontinued.
Update 22 Nov 2012: Additional information was received from the hospital neurologist. The patient was diagnosed 
with relapsing remitting Multiple Sclerosis in 2008. TYSABRI therapy was initiated in 2010 (exact date not provided).
Prior MS therapies included AVONEX (interferon beta-1a) from 2008 to 2010. As previously reported, 22 infusions 
had been administered at the time of PML suspicion in mid-Sep 2012 when the JCV [antibody] test was positive. 
The patient presented with paresis of the left upper arm. MRI on 14 Nov 2012 revealed highly suspicious cortical 
frontal lesions. The first CSF JCV PCR in Sep 2012 was negative (previously reported). There has been 
progression of symptoms and lesions since the beginning of Nov 2012. A new CSF sample (collection date 
unknown) was being shipped to (b) (6)  for JCV testing; results are pending.  NOTE: Correction to paragraph 3 of 
initial narrative: The patient's symptoms are now affecting the hand (previously reported as "not" affecting the 
hand).
Update 04 Dec 2012: The neurologist reported he is waiting for the results of the second spinal tap. He considers 
that, clinically and radiologically the case is compatible with PML.
Update 04 Dec 2012:The neurologist confirmed that the patient experiences a weakness of the right arm with 
problematic prehensile functioning of the right hand. NOTE: The following information was omitted from the 22 Nov 
2012 update. The new CSF sample that was sent to (b) (6)  was collected on 22 Nov 2012. 
Update 16 Jan 2013: The neurologist reported via a Data Collection Tool that TYSABRI was taken from Feb 2011 
to Sep 2012. The patient was positive for anit-JCV antibodies on 20 Jun 2011. The CSF JCV DNA results were as 
follows:19 Sep 2012 ((b) (6) l) negative; 22 Nov 2012 ((b) (6) ) negative; 22 Nov 2012 positive.  The patient did not 
receive PLEX or Immunoadsorption. the patient's current location si home.  MRI reports were received and

05 Oct 2011:MRI=Lesion burden stable compared to last examination of 13-Oct-2010 and absence of any 
arguments in favour of the presence of active lesions. Stable cervical and dorsal medullar lesional burden 
compared to last examination of 13-Oct-2010 and absence of any arguments in favour of the presence of active 
lesions.12 Sep 2012:MRI=Evidence of two new supra-tentorial lesions ? localization: cortical and juxtacortical at the
level of the pre-central left gyrus, as well as a small ? millimetric ? punctiform lesion of the posterior part of the left 
centrum semiovale. These two lesions are the location of a breach of the hematoencephallic barrier.Otherwise 
stability of the known lesional burden and absence of an objectively observed increase in contrast at the level of the
known lesions.Stable intra-medullar data compared to the last examination of 05-Oct-2011. Absence of new intra-
medullar lesions. No signs of active lesion.
19 Sep 2012:MRI=Hyperintense signal at the left precentral cortico-sub-cortical level. The aspect is gyriform 
following the cerebral cortex, and is punctiform at the level of the left frontal white substance, and quasi 
disappearance of the increased contrast observed on the comparative MRI. The radiological evolution of the 
ensemble of the images is more evocative of plaques of a known MS. A multifocal progressive leuco-
encephalopathy (PML) seems to us radiologically less probable, however we propose to correlate the radiological 
findings to those of a lumbar puncture with search for JC virus. A frequent MRI control is recommended. No new 
lesions, and otherwise no suspect increase of contrast were observed. 
22 Oct 2012:MRI=No new lesions. Morphological stability of the left precentral cortico-sub-cortical lesion and 
complete regression of increased contrast. Stability of the punctiform lesion of the left corona radiata with increased
contrast.
The ensemble of these findings is evocative of MS lesions. A PML at the left pre-central level seems unlikely.
14 Nov 2012:MRI= Progressive evolution of the left precentral juxtacortical lesion with onset of increased contrast 
evocative of PML . IRIS,20 Dec 2012:MRI=Global stability of the ensemble of the lesions of the white substance 
within the context of a known MS. Discrete internal extension of the left precentral juxtacortical lesion (the aspect 
remains compatible with a PML, today without aspect of IRIS). Signs of acute sinusitis. The outcome and causality 
for the event of acute sinusitis (onset 20 Dec 2012) was not provided. 
Update 22 Jan 2013: Biogen Idec considers this case to be confirmed for PML based on clinical symptoms, positive
JCV DNA in the CSF, and positive MRI. 
Update 30 Jan 2013: Follow-up from the hospital neurologist reported the symptoms are now affecting the leg as 
expected.

stated that their office saw the patient in private practice, and had not seen the patient between 27 Mar 212 and 26 
Sep 2012.  The patient was regularly seen by neurologists at the hospital where she receives her monthly TYSABRI
infusions.  The initial arm symptoms were reported by the patient to the hospital physicians.  The MRI performed on
12 Sep 2012 was a routine annual scan for a patient treated with TYSABRI, and had been planned prior to onset of 
the symptoms.  The diagnostic given by the radiology center of this MRI (MRI from 12 Sep 2012) did not suggest 
PML.  The primary treating neurologist (private practices) saw the patient next on 26 Sep 2012, eight days after her 
last TYSABRI infusions and her hospitalization in the neurology ward of the hospital ((b) (6)  to (b) (6) ).
The first MRI to suggest possible PML was the MRI from (b) (6) .
Update 25 Feb 2013:  The neurologist reported, via a company representative, that the patient experienced 
immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) (onset unknown). Treatment included corticosteroids (once), 
however, the patient did not respond to the corticosteroid treatment. Outcome of the event of IRIS was reported as 
not recovered. TYSABRI has been permanently withdrawn.
Update 28 Feb 2013: The neurologist reported, via a company representative, the following JCV test results: 19-
Sep-2012 (University hospital (b) (6) ): JCV PCR ADN (qualitative) LCR (cerebral spinal fluid) analysis revealed 
negative results (sampling date unknown); 21 Sep 2012 (University hospital (b) (6) ): JCV PCR (quantitative) sample
received revealed negative results (sampling date unknown); 22 Nov 2012 (b) (6) : JCV PCR sampling revealed 
undetected / negative results; and 22 Nov 2012 (University hospital (b) (6) ): JCV PCR ADN (qualitative) LCR 
(cerebral spinal fluid) analysis revealed positive results noted as, "a very weak viral load; results obtained with a 
commercial kit" (sampling date unknown). No further information was provided.
Update 08 Apr 2013: The neurologist reported, via a company representative, that the patient's condition is 
improving clinically and radiologically (MRI). The patient is regaining partial function of the right leg, hand, and right 
arm. No additional information was provided.
Update 25 Apr 2013: Additional information was received from the treating neurologist via a MS Standardized PML 
Data Collection Tool and diagnostic reports. The neurologist assessed the patient's estimated Karnofsky and EDSS
scores as follows: (prior to starting TYSABRI) on 12 Mar 2008 to be 90 (able to carry on normal activity; minor signs
or symptoms of disease) and 1.5; (on TYSABRI prior to PML) on 30 Mar 2011 to be 100 (normal, no complaints; no
evidence of disease) and 0; and (at the time of PML diagnosis) on 26 Sep 2012 to be 80 (normal activity with effort; 
some signs or symptoms of disease) and 3.0. On 06 Feb 2013 the patient had a cerebral MRI which revealed (in 
comparison with scan on 20 Dec 2012) imaging consistent with PMLE-IRIS with improvement of the oedema 
(especially left pre and post central, right precentral, central gray nuclei) and multiple areas of supra-and 
subtentorial contrast uptake. On 04 Mar 2013 the patient had a cerebral MRI which revealed (in comparison with 
scan of 06 Feb 2013) favorable radiographic progress. On 10 Apr 2013 the patient had a cerebral MRI done which

revealed (in comparison to scan on 04 Mar 2013) favorable radiographic progression of the left precentral PMLE 
lesion and multiple supra- and infratentorial lesions with enhancement. MS lesions stable. The neurologist 
assessed the patient's estimated Karnofsky and EDSS scores on 23 Apr 2013 to be 60 (requires occasional 
assistance but is able to care for most of personal needs) and 3. The patient is currently at home and has not 
recovered from PML. Causality was assessed as related to TYSABRI.
Update 05 Jul 2013: Additional information was received from the neurologist via a MS Standardized PML Data 
Collection Tool and diagnostic reports.  The patient was alive and residing at home. A Karnofsky score assessment
on 05 Jul 2013 was estimated to be 70 (cares for self; unable to carry on normal activity or to do active work) and 
the patients EDSS was 3. No additional lumbar punctures have been performed and the patient had not been 
diagnosed with IRIS (discrepant from previous report). A cerebral MRI performed on 24 Jun 2013 (compared to a 
13 Jun 2013 exam) revealed stability of the imaging of the known pre-central left lesion. No arguments for a new 
worsening of MS, with disappearance of the left active periventricular lesion and stability of the other lesions of the 
white substance without emergence of new lesions or contrast enhancement. A cerebral MRI performed on 13 May
2013 (compared to a 13 Apr 2013 exam) revealed radiological stability of the left pre-central PML lesions. 
Appearance of a new active lesion periventricular left within the context of known MS. Stability of multiple other 
lesions of the infra- and supratentorial white substance. The patient had not yet recovered from the event of PML 
and causality of the PML was assessed to be related to TYSABRI.
Update 20 Jan 2014: Additional information was received from the neurologist via a MS Standardized PML Data 
Collection Tool. The patient is alive, residing at home, and is not currently on any MS therapy. The neurologist 
reported the patient?s current clinical status as stable since the last report. The neurologist assessed the patient?s 
estimated Karnofsky and EDSS scores on 20 Jan 2014 to be 70 (cares for self; unable to carry on normal activity or
to do active work) and 3. 
A cerebral MRI was performed on 25 Nov 2013 and compared with a previous examination from 13 Sep 2013. The 
description was reported to be "The pre-central sub-cortical involvement lesion left is found in hypersignal T2/FLAIR
(with hypersignal diffusion, without diminution of the apparent diffusion coefficient). Stability of the linear gyriform 
contrast enhancement, compared to the known PML lesion. Stability of the multiple supra- and infratentorial lesions
of the white substance in hypersignal T2 and FLAIR, especially at the calloseptal interface; this compared to the 
known demyelinating disease. No new lesions have appeared in the meantime. No pathological contrast 
enhancement indicative of disease activity. Presence of mucous thickening at the right maxillary sinus. Partial 
obstruction of the left maxillary sinus with known components in hyosignal T2 and hypersignal T1 (hyperproteic) 
and now presence of liquid. Spumous obstruction of the left sphenoidal sinus. In conclusion, there was stable PML 
lesion pre-central left and stable MS lesions (without activity signs for the latter). Acute maxillary sinus left. No 
additional lumbar punctures have been performed. The neurologist reported that there was no IRIS (discrepant

from previous reports). The patient has not recovered from PML. Causality for the event was assessed as related 
to TYSABRI.
Update 11 Jun 2014: Additional information was received from the neurologist via a MS Standardized PML Data 
Collection Tool. The patient is alive, residing at home, and is not currently on any MS therapy. The neurologist 
reported the patient?s current clinical status as having no modification of the clinical status since last report; always 
with pyramidal syndrome of the upper right limb. On 11 Jun 2014, the neurologist assessed the patient?s estimated
Karnofsky and EDSS scores to be 70 (cares for self; unable to carry on normal activity or to do active work) and 3, 
respectively. On 23 Apr 2014, a brain MRI was done with results reported as follows: stability of the PML lesion pre-
central left. Progressive demyelinating left frontal superior lesion with contrast enhancement indicative of character.
No additional lumbar punctures have been performed. The patient has not recovered from PML and has recovered 
from IRIS. Causality for the events to TYSABRI was not provided.
Update 30 Jun 2014: A report was received via the literature, Lalive PH, Ferfoglia RI, Bridel C, et al. Minimal 
supportive treatment in natalizumab-related PML in a MS patient.  J Neurol Neurosurg Psychiatry. 2014;0:1-2. 
Doi:10.1136/jnnp-2014-308154.  The author reported on a patient diagnosed with RRMS at 46 years old. JCV IgG 
serum status was positive 6 months after natalizumab initiation.  After 22 infusions, the patient presented with 
progressive symptoms of right arm weakness and ESDD of 3.0 (presume timeperiod is Sep 2012 based on prior 
report).  MRI revealed new atypical linear hyperintense T2 lesion in the left subcortical precentral region suggestive 
of PML.  However, CSF analysis for JCV DNA by PCR was negative. Two months later, the patient was clinically 
stable but MRI showed progression of the lesion. A second spinal tap revealed a positive JCV DNA by PCR and 
confirmed the diagnosis of PML. Since the spontaneous washout of NTZ is expected to be completed 3 months 
after treatment cessation, it was decided not to initiate PLEX. Three months after NTZ cessation, the symptoms 
were aggravated with a progression of the right arm paresis associated with a right central facial hemiparesis and a
right leg paresis (EDSS of 4.0). The MRI showed a largely unchanged lesion with no signs of IRIS and no CS 
treatment was initiated. One month later the MRI showed IRIS with substantial progression of the lesion on 
T2/FLAIR and diffusion trace b1000 with associated mass effect and linear contrast enhancement, together with 
the appearance of multiple bilateral supratentorial and infratentorial contrast-enhancing lesions even though the 
patient had reported no new symptoms. Methylprednisolone intravenous 500 mg was initiated. The day after 
treatment initiation, the patient experienced worsening symptoms. Clinical exam confirmed the deterioration of the 
right hemiparesis. The patients refused additional CS. Follow-up MRI demonstrated a decrease of IRIS and the 
clinical exams showed a progressive recovery. One year after PML diagnosis, the patient recovered completely 
except for the persistence of right arm paralysis (EDSS of 3.0). The duration of the radiologic IRIS was 
approximately 6 months.

Collection Tool. The patient is alive, residing at home, and is not currently on any MS therapy. The neurologist 
assessed the patient?s estimated Karnofsky and EDSS scores on 09 Dec 2014 to be 70 (cares for self; unable to 
carry on normal activity or to do active work) and 3. No additional brain MRIs have been performed since 23 Apr 
2014 (previously reported). As 09 Dec 2014, the patient had not recovered from PML and had recovered from IRIS.
Causality for the events of PML and IRIS was assessed as related to TYSABRI.
