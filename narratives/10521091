MEDICALLY SIGNIFICANT
The below information is a case summary from 20 Aug 2014 to 30 Oct 2014:
A 28 year old Italian male patient on TYSABRI for MS x 24 infusions from 10 Sep 2012 to 12 Aug 2014. His MS 
was diagnosed in Mar 2008. He tested anti-JCV antibody positive with index of 2.703 on 10-Jul-2012. The patient 
had no IS history and was previously on Betaferon up to 2010 and then Rebif. Clinically, the patient was 
asymptomatic. PML suspicion was prompted by MRI findings from 08-Aug-2014 which showed a new non 
enhancing atypical lesion in the left thalamic area. Repeat MRI from 21 Aug 2014 showed that the left thalamic 
lesion appeared unchanged in size and morphology. CSF for JCV PCR obtained on 21 Aug 2014 returned negative
from(b) (6)  and a local lab. Follow up MRI from 27 Aug 2014 remained unchanged. The presence in the left

thalamic area of a curved lesion, with well-defined edges, hyperintense on long TR sequences and with mild 
hypeintensity on DWI, unchanged in size (of maximum 15 mm in diameter) and morphology compared to the 
reference examination. MRI from 04 Sep 2014 continued to show no changes. The patient received 3 cycles of 
PLEX and was started on mirtazapine since 21 Aug 2014. At this point (09 Sep 2014), the neurologist felt that the 
final diagnosis was radiological MS reactivation as the patient remained stable and asymptomatic. The patient 
underwent another repeat MRI on 17 Sep 2014 which findings were  definitely stable . However, clinically the 
patient was showing "doubtful" sensory symptoms and was deemed to have worsened compared to when he was 
discharged, more specifically the patient showed worsened cognitive functions. A CSF sample was performed and 
sent to (b) (6)  for JCV testing which  returned positive at 14 copies/mL (results received on 03 Oct 2014). Biogen 
Idec considers this case confirmed for PML on 30 Oct 2014 based on the radiologic evidence and positive CSF for 
JCV (received on 03 Oct 2014).
Update 25 Nov 2014: Additional information was received from a neurologist via MS Standardized PML Data 
Collection Tool. The patient is alive, residing at home, and is not currently on any MS therapy.  The patient was 
diagnosed with IRIS by clinical symptoms including motor multifocal (upper and lower right limbs hypoesthesia), 
sensory multifocal (right side hypoesthesia) (onsets 21Oct 2014), and MRI findings.  The patient did not receive 
corticosteroids pre-IRIS. The neurologist assessed the patient s estimated Karnofsky and EDSS scores in 01 Jul 
2012 (prior to starting TYSABRI) to be 90 (able to carry on normal activity; minor signs or symptoms of disease) 
and 3; 19 Feb 2014 (on TYSABRI prior to PML) to be 90 (able to carry on normal activity; minor signs or symptoms 
of disease) and 3; and 08 Aug 2014 (at the time of PML diagnosis) to be 90 (able to carry on normal activity; minor 
signs or symptoms of disease) and 3. The patient was tested for serum anti-JCV antibodies on 19 Jul 2012 with 
positive results of 2.703 index value at (b) (6)   MRI was performed prior to PML diagnosis on 03 Feb 2014 and at 
time of PML diagnosis on 08 Aug 2014; results were not provided. The patient underwent a lumbar puncture on 23 
Sep 2014 with results reported as positive for CSF JCV DNA at 12 copies per mL. As of 14 Nov 2014, the patient 
has not recovered from PML and has not recovered from IRIS. Causality for the events was assessed as related to 
TYSABRI.
Update 16 Mar 2015: A report was received from literature. De Mercanti, S., Alberto Artusi, C., Clerico, M., 
Iudicello, M., et al. Atypical Presentation of Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy in a Natalizumab-treated 
Patient. Insight Medmeme. Abstract presented at the 67th Annual Meeting of the American Academy of Neurology 
(AAN); Washington, DC; USA on 17 Apr 2015. The authors presented a case report regarding a 28 year old man 
affected by RRMS that showed MRI findings compatible with PML (left thalamic lesion without contrast 
enhancement) during treatment with TYSABRI after 24th course, in absence of neurological signs or symptoms. 
Interferon beta-1a was the previous therapy. TYSABRI was immediately interrupted and JCV-DNA was detected in 
cerebrospinal fluid with a viral load of 12 copies/mL. Three plasma-exchanges were performed and mirtazapine 
administered. For the next two months patient remained asymptomatic and underwent a strict MRI follow up, one

MRI every 2 weeks, with no changes. On Oct 2014 right-hand weakness and hypoesthesia suddenly occurred, 
followed by right leg paresis with gait impairment. A new MRI showed enlargement of the thalamic lesion, extending
to upper white matter along the cortico-spinal tract up to the cortical prerolandic area and no contrast enhancement.
Considering the probable late worsening of PML, anti-edema drugs were administered with partial recovery. Two 
weeks later a new MRI showed contrast enhancement of all the previous MS lesions and partially of the PML 
lesion, without a further dimension increase; moreover a new lesion of the left upper cerebellar peduncle appeared.
The findings were consistent with PML immune reconstruction inflammatory syndrome (IRIS), high dose 
intravenous steroids (NOS) were administered. The article concludes that Pauci- or a-symptomatic PML should be 
strictly clinically and radiologically followed-up because of the possible rapid worsening even after a long period of 
stability. After some months from PML diagnosis, physicians should take into account that neurological worsening 
could be due to PML extension as well as to IRIS occurrence.
Update 17 Mar 2015: Additional information was received from a neurologist via a clinical report at 6 months from 
PML diagnosis. Neurology anamnesis was reported as follows:
10 Sep 2012: natalizumab was started. On 08 Aug 2014, the scheduled brain MRI with contrast media, after the 
23rd administration of intravenous TYSABRI, showed the presence of a new lesion, hyperintense on T2 and left 
thalamic region without uptake of contrast medium. On (b) (6)  in consideration of the atypical features of the 
new lesion (location, size) the patient, although asymptomatic, was hospitalized in order to perform diagnostic 
investigations on radiological suspicion of PML. On the day of admission, the patient underwent a brain MRI with 
contrast medium that was stable compared to the previous one from 08 Aug 2014, and lumbar puncture for the 
determination of JCV DNA, that resulted negative (sensitivity of the test, negative for viral replication <50 copies / 
ml). So, after the full blood test, the first treatment by plasmapheresis was performed. Two other cycles, 
respectively on 23 and 25 Aug 2014 were performed. The treatments were well tolerated, except for a reduction of 
the anti-thrombin III, after the first and third cycle, immediately recovered. The patient was administered with 
mirtazapine, starting from 15 mg/day, up to 30 mg/day. During hospitalization the patient was asymptomatic and no 
new neurological signs were detected at the scheduled neurological examinations. The brain MRI with contrast 
medium did not show changes in the morphology of the known left thalamic lesion. 17 Sep 2014: MRI brain with 
contrast medium showed left thalamic lesion unchanged. 18 Sep 2014: at neurological examination it was reported 
a slight deterioration of right hand sensitivity (with difficulty in writing) and minimal dysarthria. 24 Sep 2014: The 
patient reported substantial stability of the clinical picture, with persistence of right hand hypoesthesia. Neither 
memory nor semantics difficulties were reported. The physical examination showed minimum right dysmetria in the 
finger to nose test, no changes with respect to the previous examination. 02 Oct 2014 (date discrepant from 
previous report): JCV DNA test showed the presence of 12 copies; compatible with a diagnosis of PML. 06 Oct 
2014: The patient presented to the outpatient clinic due to worsening of the sthenic/sensory deficit of the upper right
end limb, with difficulty to perform precise movements (e.g. use tools, writing). The patient underwent a brain MRI 
with contrast medium showing slight enlargement of some already present lesions, while the thalamic lesion is

substantially unchanged. Pathological contrasts were not observed. The patient was hospitalized. During the first 
days of hospitalization the patient developed a slow and progressive worsening of strength in the right hand and the
appearance of occasional gait disturbance related to strength deficit in the lower right limb; Mingazzini II test 
showed a slight (sic). The brain MRI performed on 09 Oct 2014 showed further volumetric increase (compared to 
the one on 06 Oct 2014) of the extensive and confluent areas of altered signal, involving on the left, the juxtacortical
white matter of the prerolandic and superior frontal gyri, the cortical-spinal region (in the posterior region of the 
internal capsule), the thalamus and the cerebral peduncle, related to PML affected area; demyelination was 
unchanged; no abnormal area evidenced by the contrast medium. An anti-edema therapy with steroids and 
mannitol was added to Mirtazapine with partial relief. A cycle of neuromotor rehab was started after physiatrist 
counselling. The patient was assigned to rehab (level II). On 21 Oct 2014, a control brain MRI with contrast medium
showed stable confluent alteration signal extending from the prerolandic cortex to the cerebral peduncle, involving 
the cortical spinal area and thalamus. The contrast medium evidenced irregular area in the structure of the lesion 
with mixed pattern, partially linear, and partially spotted (related to perivascular inflammation) and partially with a 
band shape, a small T2w with demyelination focus of the left upper cerebellar peduncle. Moreover, there were 
signs of inflammatory reactivation of many of the demyelination plaques lesion load background. Overall, the 
findings expressed the signs of immune reconstitution (PML-IRIS). Given the radiological picture compatible with 
IRIS, on 21 Oct 2014 a cycle of steroidal boluses (Solumedrol 1 g/day) was initiated for 10 days (from 21 Oct to 30 
Oct 2014). On 24 Oct 2014, there was evidence of deterioration in gait and in strengths as diagnosed (weakness of
the districts also proximal). Repeat brain MRI with contrast medium remained unchanged with respect to the 
previous year. Therapy was continued with high-dose intravenous steroid and neurological conditions improved 
slightly despite a picture of weakness in the limbs of the right and dysarthria, severity fluctuating. The patient was 
discharged to rehabilitation, neuromotor activity level II. Medications at discharge included mirtazapine 30 mg; 
Solumedrol 1 g / day for 2 days every 2 weeks. Maintenance steroid therapy post bolus steroid: Deltacortene 75 mg
for 3 days, then continue with Deltacortene 50 mg/day (to be interrupted only during the days of steroid bolus). 
07 Nov 2014: neurological examination after MRI control of the brain was essentially stable compared to the 
previous control. Therapeutic program as determined at discharge continued. 14 Nov 2014: neurological 
examination of the brain control after MRI was stable, moderate increase in the intake of contrast pathological 
thalamic sin (sic), broadly stable compared to the previous control, with slight improvement of the dysarthric 
disorder and gait. Therapeutic program as determined at discharge continued. 28 Nov 2014: neurological 
examination of the brain control after MRI showed unchanged size, morphology and intensity of alteration of signal 
extended from the bark until prerolandic left cerebral peduncle; reduced instead impregnations contrastographic 
both of this injury is the point of outbreaks frontal lobes. Neurologic improvement was noted; in particular the 
weakness f-bc dx (sic) is reduced, with improved gait and dysarthria. A reno-bladder ultrasound was normal; RPM 
physiological. 12 Dec 2014: neurological examination after MRI of the brain with contrast medium: the sthenic and 
sensitive deficit clearly improved to load of the right hemisoma. CN VII deficit no longer detectable and nuanced 
dysarthria remains. 16 Jan 2015: neurological examination showed further improvement in the sthenic and sensory

deficit in the right limb, and documented weight gain. 26 Feb 2015: last cycle of high-dose intravenous steroid was 
administered. There was sthenic and ambulatory clinical improvement. Following the latest neurological evaluation: 
Alert, oriented in time and space, cooperative. Disturbance of short-term memory. Tone thymic normally. Praxic, 
linguistic and gnostic functions were satisfactory. Cranial nerves: visual acuity corrected with lenses, tactile 
hypoesthesia facial bilateral (greater at left hemiface). Minimum dysarthria.  Standing: permitted. Instability in 
tandem. Romberg negative. Ambulation: permitted, paretic right. Mingazzini I: minimum shook the atonic distal 
upper limb borne dx. Mingazzini II: properly executed. Tone and muscle trophism: bilateral pyramidal hypertonia. 
Force segmental: globally reduced right limb, but improved since the last exam (4 +/ 5). There persists a particularly
deficient extension of the fingers of the right hand. Deep tendon reflexes: weak in all four limbs, since a slight 
prevalence of the upper limbs. Plantar reflex: down right, indifferent sign of left clonus. Sensory: TA-TE-DO left 
facial-brachial-crural hypoaesthesia. Cerebral signs: not defined dysmetry. Sphincteric functions were preserved.
Update 27 Jul 2015: Additional information was received from the neurologist via a MS Standardized PML Data 
Collection Tool. The patient is currently on the following MS therapy: mitoxantrone since 04 Jun 2015. The patient's 
IRIS symptoms include: cognitive / behavioral - mood depression and motor- right hemiparesis (onsets 21 Oct 
2014). Treatment for IRIS included methylprednisolone 1000 mg, IV, twice a month from 21 Oct 2014 to Feb 2015 
and prednisolone 25 mg, by mouth, daily from 21 Oct 2014 to 25 Feb 2015. The patient's most recent brain MRI 
was performed on 26 May 2015 (results not provided). The neurologist on 21 Jul 2015 assessed the patient's 
Karnofsky score to be 70 (cares for self; unable to carry on normal activity or to do active work) and in Jul 2015 
assessed the patient's EDSS score to be 4.5. The neurologist assessed the event of IRIS on 25 Feb 2015 (results 
were not provided).
Update 22 Sep 2015. Additional information was received from the neurologist  that the patient is alive and he is at 
home. Both PML and IRIS resolved in May 2015. No additional information was reported.
