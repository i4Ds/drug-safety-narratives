Medically Significant
A medical doctor reported, via a dissertation: Grosset-Janin C. A retrospective study of 13 patients who developed 
progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy under natalizumab: clinical and radiological, that a 44 year old female 
patient on TYSABRI (300 mg, IV, QM) for Multiple Sclerosis from unknown date to unknown date experienced PML
suspicion (onset unknown).  The dissertation was presented at University of Toulouse, France, on 02 Oct 2014. 
The author presented 13 cases of PML from two university hospitals. The diagnosis of PML was made or 
suspected between Dec 2009 and Jun 2014. Patient information was collected from medical records that were 
reviewed retrospectively from the hospital databases. The article reported that the female patient (b)(6) was diagnosed
with multiple sclerosis in 1997 at the age of 27. The neurologist assessed the event of PML as confirmed. JCV PCR
in CSF was 653 copies. At the time of PML diagnosis, the patient was 44 year old and MS was evolving for 13 
years. TYSABRI was started 10 years after MS was diagnosed and ongoing at the time of PML. The patient had

received 84 infusions. JCV serology was positive. The patient had not received any immunosuppressive agent 
before TYSABRI and had 2 risk factors for the event.  The outcome for the event PML suspicion is unknown. The 
causality for the event of PML suspicion is unknown.  It is unknown if TYSABRI treatment is ongoing.  French 
Imputability: C2S2I2
Update 17 Nov 2014: The neurologist reported that she thinks that the patient is followed up from time to time in her
hospital unit (NOS). No further information was given.  French imputability : C2 S2 I2
Update 01 Feb 2015: Follow-up information from the neurologist reported the initials of patient as (b)(6)  and provided 
the date of birth. French Imputability: C1S1I1
Update 22 Jul 2015: Follow-up information was received from the prescribing/treating neurologist via a suspect 
PML Data Collection Form. The patient first experienced first signs of MS in 1997. MS symptoms included memory 
disorders, visual loss and balance disorder. The suspect product was confirmed as TYSABRI (300 mg, IV, QM) 
which was started on 03 Aug 2007 and stopped on 20 Apr 2014 due to the current PML suspicion. The patient did 
not experience any interruption of TYSABRI for greater than three months. The patient had received no prior 
immunosuppressant or immunomodulatory therapies. Serum anti-JCV antibody status was positive on 30 May 
2014 ((b) (6) ). The patient was evaluated for PML due to presenting with suggestive clinical signs and symptoms, 
which also prompted MRI which revealed suspicious findings. Clinical signs and symptoms included cognitive 
behavioral slowed (onset Dec 2013), motor deficit of the left hand (onset May 2014), speech dysarthria/lack of word
(onset May 2014), and cerebellar balance disorder (onset Dec 2013). MRI prior to PML suspicion was performed in 
Mar 2014 (results not provided). MRI at the time of PML suspicion was performed on 02 Jun 2014 (results not 
provided). Lumbar puncture was performed on 05 Jun 2014 and tested positive with 653 copies/ml (United States 
laboratory) and tested negative at a (presumed) local laboratory. CSF analysis was normal (cell count, protein, 
glucose). Brain biopsy has not been performed. At the time of PML suspicion, on 06 Jun 2014, the following 
laboratory results were reported: absolute leukocyte count 6.73 g/l (reference range 4.3-10), absolute lymphocyte 
count 2686 /ul (1270-3230), CD3 1880 /ul (900-1900), CD3-CD4 1343 /ul (500-1250), CD3-CD8 484 /ul (350-900), 
CD4-CD8 698 /ul (400-1200), IgG 5.05 g/l (6.82-12.66), IgA 1.18 g/l (0.84-2.69), IgM 0.63 g/l (0.7-0.99). PML 
treatment included mirtazapine (30 mg, QD; dates not provided), Solumedrol (methylprednisolone) 1g per 5 days 
from 10 May 2014 to 15 May 2014 before the diagnosis of PML, 1g per 3 days from 08 Aug 2014 to 10 Aug 2014, 
1g per 6 days from 28 Aug 2014 to 02 Sep 2014 for IRIS, and Solupred (prednisolone) from 03 Sep 2014 to Feb 
2015. The patient did not receive plasmatic exchanges or other treatments different from drugs. The patient's 
current location was rehabilitation facility. Based on the reporter's evaluation PML has been confirmed. The patient 
has not received any MS disease therapy since cessation of TYSABRI. French Imputability: C2S2I2.
