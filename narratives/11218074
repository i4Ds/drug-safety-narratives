Medically Significant
A neurologist spontaneously reported via a Biogen Area Business Manager (ABM) that an adult male patient on 
TYSABRI for Multiple Sclerosis for 1 dose on 22 Jun 2013 (300 mg, IV, QM), and on TECFIDERA since 2015 
(unknown dose, unknown route, unknown frequency), was being screened for possible PML due to suspicious 
lesions (presumed suspicious lesions found on MRI) (onset 2015).  The patient was diagnosed with MS on 01 Sep 
2010 and previous MS therapies included Betaseron (interferon beta-1b) and Rebif (interferon beta-1a). The 
reporter added that at this time, the patient does not have any signs or symptoms of PML. An MRI performed on an
unknown date showed lesions suspicious for PML. No treatment information was provided. The event of possible 
PML characterized by suspicious lesions is ongoing. The causality for the event of possible PML characterized by 
suspicious lesions to either TECFIDERA or TYSABRI was not reported.  TECFIDERA therapy continues.
Update 16 Jun 2015: Additional information received from the patient's neurologist indicated the patient had not 
been seen since Apr 2013 and he has "no knowledge of this".

Update 16 Jun 2015: Additional information was received from the patient's current neurologist via the same Biogen
ABM. The physican believes the event of possible PML characterized by suspicious lesions is associated wtih 
TECFIDERA, not Tysabri.  PML was first referenced in an MRI from Jan (presumed 2015); MRI details were not 
provided. The patient was noted to be JCV negative (presumed antibodies) last month (May 2015). A follow-up MRI
is planned for this month (Jun 2015) and an lumbar pucture (LP) is not planned at this time. The patient was noted 
to be non-compliant with the physician's orders but has been stable over the last five months.
