Event Description: The grandmother of a 9 year-old female patient reported that her granddaughter experienced 
fever, shaking, couldn't walk, head jerky, tired, muscles hurt, cannot stand, trouble breathing, unusual breathing, 
and shimmying while using PROAIR.  The patient is currently taking the following concomitant medication, Benadryl
and has a medical history of asthma.  The patient has been using ProAir HFA for a couple of years, which she uses
approximately once weekly.  She recently obtained a new canister.  On 14-Jan-2016, the patient had a fever, 99.5 
degrees F.  The fever resolved.  On18-Jan-2016 at 10:00pm, she had trouble breathing and was given ProAir HFA 
and Benadryl. (b) (6)  after using the ProAir, the patient experienced unusual breathing and "shaking all 
over."  She was taken to the Emergency Room (ER) for "practically all night" and was discharged.  On (b) (6)
 the patient was taken to her physician.  While in the physician's office, she experienced "couldn't walk," due 
to her knees going, and "head jerky."  The patient experienced "tired and muscles hurt."  Additionally, "I cannot 
stand," which was mostly on her right hand side.  The patient's hand and foot were shimmying, described as 
"picked hand up, right hand started to shake and right foot would go up" which lasted one hour.  The nurse was 
called to see the symptoms, while the mother, or grandmother filmed her with a camera so the physician could 
view.  The physician referred the patient back to the ER, where she was given IV fluids, urine and blood tests, and a
CT scan.  All tests were normal.  The patient was in the ER for approximately five hours and discharged.   The 
patient's symptoms are continuing today, although she is able to stand and walk a little better.  The grandmother 
was unable to provide complete provider, hospital, and medication information.  No further information was 
provided.

This case was considered serious based on the following criteria: (Other Serious (Important Medical Events))
Teva Comment:  SALBUTAMOL. A contributory role cannot be excluded for events of Shaking all over and Unusual
breathing. Causality: Possible. Patient had been on PROAIR for a few years and did not experience any similar 
events. Despite all of the neurological events the patient reported, she had a normal blood tests and CT scan. 
Therefore, the available information does not support a causal role for PROAIR.  Causality: Not related for all of the
other reported events. 
Because this is a spontaneous case, regulatory distribution will be handled as though it is a related case.
