MEDICALLY SIGNIFICANT
On 22 Aug 2013
A neurologist spontaneously reported that a 36 year old female patient on TYSABRI (IV, 300mg, QM) since 2010 
presented with clinical and MRI features highly suggestive of PML and was recently hospitalized.  PML suspicion 
was based on clinical presentation with motor deficiency in the right part of the body worsening for a few days that 
prompted hospitalization. After being questioned, the patient specified that this motor deficiency started in May 
2013. On 22 Aug 2013, brain MRI revealed a new left rolandic juxtacortical lesion very PML suggestive : this 
hypersignal T2 lesion had no mass effect, had poorly defined limits, wasn't Gd enhanced was also seen on 
diffusion sequencies. Lumbar puncture was scheduled on 23 Aug 2013 in order  to send CSF sample to (b) (6)  for
JCV PCR testing.
Anti-JCV antibodies were found positive (date unknown). The patient had never been treated with

infusion performed at the end of Jul 2013 approximately 3 weeks earlier).

A study investigator reported that the 36 year old female (birth date: (b) (6) ) patient receiving TYSABRI (IV, 300 
mg, QM) from 01 Feb 2010 and enrolled in the (b) (6)  was 
hospitalized on (b) (6)  for a right hemiparesis having began several weeks earlier.
On (b) (6)  the patient MRI showed PML suspected lesions (NOS). TYSABRI was discontinued on 19 Jul 
(b) (6)  due to the event (date of last infusion) and the patient underwent 3 sessions of PLEX on (b)(6) ,
(b)  and (b) (6)(6)  
2013. JCV PCR testing performed on (b) (6)  returned negative.
Regarding the patient's medical history, MS first symptoms appeared in Aug 1998 and were first treated with 
AVONEX from Apr 1999 to Jul 2005 then Rebif from Aug 2005 to Jan 2010. She had no further medical history. 
Patient's EDSS prior to TYSABRI initiation was 5 on 29 Jan 2010 then 5.5 on 08 Mar 2013 (most recent 
assessment prior to PML), walking distance was 200 m.
Moreover, the patient had a risk factor of TYSABRI therapy without discontinuation during more than 3 years.
At the time of the event, concomitant medication included Lyrica for pain from 01 Jan 2012, Seroplex for 
depression from 01 Jan 2013, Tamsulosine for urinary disorders from 01 Jan 2012 and Topalgic for pain from 01 
Jan 2013. 
The investigator assessed the event as severe and related to TYSABRI. At the time of reporting, the event did not 
resolve and the patient remained hospitalized.

Update on 06 and 09 Sep 2013
The investigator reported that the last TYSABRI infusion performed on 19 Jul 2013 was the 44th infusion (and not 
the 41st as previously reported). The patient had presented with right hemiparesis since 01 May 2013 leading 
tosuspect PML.
On 17 Jun 2013, brain MRI showed subcortical lesion involvingU fibers below the central nucleus with a sharp 
border toward the grey matter. This lesion suggestive of PML was T2 Flair hyperintense and T1 hypointense with a 
slow extension. There was neither mass effect nor Gd enhancement. PCR JCV testing came back positive (769 
copies). Other CSF analysis showed 1 cell, proteins at 0.34g and glucose at 5.81 mmol/l. The patient didn't receive 
any prior immunosuppressants for MS or another disease. At the time of reporting, the patient hasn't experienced 
any IRIS.The patient was administered Mirtazapine (30mg, QD, PO)since (b) (6)  Methylprednisolone (1g, QD, 
IV) from (b) (6)  to (b) (6)  and from 05 Sep to 08 Sep 2013. The 4th and 5th plasma exchange sessions 
were performed respectively on (b) (6)  and (b) (6)  On (b) (6)  the patient was still hospitalized.

Karnosfky score was 70 on 29 Jan 2010 (before PML suspicion) and 30 on (b) (6) . On (b) (6)  EDSS 
score was 8.0 (and 5.0 before PML suspicion).
Prior to PML diagnosis, MS disease symptoms were right hemiparesia (2/5 RMC), dysarthria, diplopia and right arm
paresthesia all appeared on 01 May 2013. The patient has been tested positive for serum anti-JCV antibody status 
((b) (6) ) on an unknown date in 2011.

On 16 Nov 2013:
The neurologist reported additional following  information on this event in a communication during a meeting on 16 
Nov 2013: Brain MRI performed in Mar 2013 at the time of the 40th infusion showed stable lesional load. 
Furthermore,  EDSS assessment  was 5  in May 2013 just prior to PML susipcion.

Update 26 Jun 2014: A report was received from the regulatory authority of France (ref MA20141223). PML was 
assessed as recovered with sequelaes. The patient has a medical history of  ophthalmic migraine and active 
smoking. Concomitant treatment included Forlax, Eductil, Zolpidem. The first PML clinical symptoms included right 
hemiparesis since early  (b) (6)  asthenia, clinical condition worsening, progressive worsening of intermittent 
diplopia, partially improvedwith   Solumedrol  (methylprednisolone) in early Jul 2013. Clinical examination on time of
diagnosis revealed middle cerebellar dysarthria, right hemiparesis, ataxia of uppers limbs, right hemicorporal 
hypoesthesia, paresthesia of 4 members and face, diplopia especially expressed when eyes turn laterally right with 
deficit of right VI cranial nerve, multidirectional nystagmus, swallowing disorders with salivary stasis and no fever.. 
Immunophenotype analysis / biological investigations (dates unk)  revealed  T-lymphopenia, no clonal 
abnormalities, negative viral serology, antiNTZ antibodies negatives. CSF electophoresis: slight synthesis of 
intrathecal Ig G, no oligoclonal Ig G, no transsudate. Rapid and progressive worsening on(b) (6)
quadriplegia, left upper limb ataxia, diffuse dysesthesiaof 4 members and face, permanent diplopia, multidirectional
nystagmus, cerebellar dysarthria and intermittent swallowing disorders, leading to treatment with steroid bolus from 
(b) to (b) (6)(6)  with clinical improvement. Control clinical examination in Dec 2013, Jan, Mar and May 2014: 
middle but progressive clinical improvement. Motor disorders in 4 members persisted. MRIs (date unk) : lesions are
stables, with minimal Gd enhancement, showing persistent inflammation. As the patient did not presented with MS 
relapse, no disease modifying therapy  was given, but only regular clinical and MRI monitoring. French Imputability

12 Mar 2014, EDSS was 8.0. Study drop out visit was on 19 Aug 2014. On 19 Aug 2014, EDSS was 8.0. The 
neurologist considered PML as serious on (b) (6)  According to the neurologist, PML met the following 
criteria : medically significant and disability [hospitalization was also previously reported].  French imputability: C2

Update 23 Jan 2015: Additional information was received from a neurologist via a MS Standardized PML Data 
Collection Tool. The patient is alive, residing at home, and is not currently on any MS therapy. The neurologist 
assessed the patient's estimated Karnofsky and EDSS scores on 19 Aug 2014 to be 40 (disabled; requires special 
care and assistance) and 8. The most recent MRI was performed on 19 Aug 2014 (results not provided). The 
patient was diagnosed with IRIS. As of 19 Aug 2014, the patient had not recovered from PML and had not 
recovered from IRIS. Causality for the events of PML and IRIS was assessed as related to TYSABRI. French
