AER 1598707 is a spontaneous case, received on 24/Jun/2015 from a physician via BfArM (Germany : reference 
number: DEDCGMA15166542) and concerns a 73 year old male who developed neurologic neglect syndrome, 
progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, visual field defect, JC virus positive liquor (jc virus test positive), 
creatine kinase increased, watery diarrhea, suspected aspiration pneumonia, acute renal insufficiency, fall, ankle 
injury, suspected formation of antibodies against platelets whilst being treated with rituximab (Mabthera), idelalisib 
(Zydelig).
The patient's medical history included alcohol abuse, chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, aplasia, thrombocytopenia, 
chronic pancreatitis, glaucoma, chronic renal insufficiency, appendectomy, cholecystectomy, retinal detachment, 
vertebral fractures. Past drugs included fludarabine. Concomitant medications included bendamustine, globulin, 
immune (Immunoglobulin), aspirin, simvastatin. No concurrent conditions were reported
Since 1999, the patient was diagnosed with (Stage Binet C / RAI stage 4) chronic lymphocytic leukaemia.  On an 
unspecified date in /Oct/2013, the patient started therapy with intravenous rituximab (dose, form, frequency not 
reported) for chronic lymphocytic leukaemia progression. Later, this therapy was stopped in /Mar/2014 and was 
restarted on 26/Nov/2014 with oral idelalisib 100 mg (frequency, form not reported) for chronic lymphocytic 
leukaemia progression. Approximately since 15/May/2015 he suffered from visual field loss on the left side, neglect 
on the left side and leg paresis on the left side. On (b) (6)  he developed neurologic neglect syndrome. On 
(b) (6)  due to increased uncertain gait he fell down, injured his right ankle and presented at hospital. Cranial 
computed tomography performed on (b) (6)  revealed fresh medullary ischemia in the parieto-occipital region 
on the right side. Sub-acute cerebral ischemia was suspected. Rituximab and idelalisib were discontinued on the 
same day. Same day urea was 58 mg/dL (17-43), creatinine was 1.6 mg/dL, uric acid was 8.7 mg/dL, total protein 
was 54 g/L (64-83), glomerular filtration rate was 43 mL/min, potassium was 2.9 mmol/L (3.5-5), calcium was 1.93

mmol/L (2.2-2.65), white blood cell count was 10.3 tsd/mcl (3.9-9.8), erythrocyte count was 3.42 mio/mcl (4.45-
5.77), haemoglobin was 10.6 g/dL (13.5-17.5), haematocrit was 32 % (40-51), thrombocyte count was 29 tsd/mcl 
(146-328), neutrophil granulocytes absolute was 0.516 tsd/mcl (1800-6200), basophil count was 0.0 tsd/mcl (0.01-
0.08), absolute lymphocyte count was 0.206 tsd/mcl (1.0-3200), lymphocyte count was 2% (17-47).Aspirin, at 100 
mg and simvastatin were started. On (b) (6)  absolute lymphocyte count was 12.976 tsd/mcl, lymphocyte 
count was 61%. A cranial MRI performed on (b) (6)  revealed right hemispheric leukoencephalopathy. Sub-
acute cerebral ischemia was excluded. Idelalisib and aspirin were discontinued. Same day, urea was 97 mg/dL, 
creatinine was 2 mg/dL, glomerular filtration rate was 33 mL/min, potassium was 4.2 mmol/L, white blood cell count
was 20.7 tsd/mcl, erythrocyte count was 4.45 mio/mcl, haemoglobin was 32 g/dL, haematocrit was 40 %, 
thrombocyte count was, 37 tsd/mcl, neutrophil granulocytes absolute was 0.729 tsd/mcl, basophil count was 0.0 
tsd/mcl. Electroencephalography performed on (b) (6)  revealed alpha basic rhythm at the lower frequency 
limit on the left side in comparison to the right side and continuous, right hemispheric, theta, delta focal lesions. In 
the course of time, he experienced fever, had increased infection parameters and creatine kinase was also 
increased. Aspiration pneumonia (differential diagnosis thrombophlebitis) was suspected. Piperacillin and 
tazobactam were started. Because of resistance against piperacillin and tazobactam the therapy was switched to 
meropenem. Increased infection parameters normalised. In the course of hospitalization the patient experienced 
massive watery diarrhea. Clostridium caused enteritis was suspected. He was isolated and therapy with 
metronidazol was started. Additionally he received intravenously fluid substitution. The suspicion of clostridium 
caused enteritis could not be confirmed. As part of the infection and massive loss of fluid he developed acute 
chronic renal insufficiency. The intravenous administration of fluid was increased. Due to decreased thrombocyte 
count a thrombocyte concentrate was given to the patient. This condition did not improve and therefore two further 
erythrocyte concentrates were given to him on the next day. Formation of antibodies against platelets was 
suspected. On (b) (6)  he was handed over to the internist. There, he received further erythrocyte transfusion 
and cortisone. On 03/Jun/2015 a lumbar puncture was performed. The test for JC virus was positive. Also, protein 
in liquor was 462 mg/l, albumin was 29 g/l (35-52), Immunoglobulin M 0.06 (0.4-2.3), Immunoglobulin A was 0.28 
(0.7-4.0), measles IgG was 870 u/ml, mumps IgG was 50 u/ml, herpes simplex -1 IgG > 150 u/ml, herpes simplex -
2 IgG was 49 u/ml, varicella zoster virus IgG was 1019 mu/ml. Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy was 
confirmed. Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy was assessed as most likely caused by rituximab and 
idelalisib. Due to this event a therapy with mefloquine, at 200 mg once weekly and Mirtazapin, at 30 mg once daily 
(0-0-1) was started. Further, the patient received immunoglobulins once every 3 weeks.
At the time of this report, outcome of the events neurologic neglect syndrome, progressive multifocal 
leukoencephalopathy, visual field defect and JC virus positive liquor (JC virus test positive) were improved while 
outcome of creatine kinase increased, watery diarrhea, suspected aspiration pneumonia, acute renal insufficiency, 
fall, ankle injury, suspected formation of antibodies against platelets was not reported.
