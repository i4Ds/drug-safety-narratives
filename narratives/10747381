A neurologist spontaneously reported that a 50 year old female patient on TYSABRI (300 mg, IV, QM) for Multiple 
Sclerosis from unknown date to Aug 2014 was hospitalized from an unknown date to an unknown date for PML 
suspicion (onset 22 Oct 2014). No prior immunosuppressive therapy before starting TYSABRI was reported. As of 
Aug 2014 when the patient had decided to stop TYSABRI therapy, the patient had received a total of 48 infusions. 
The patient switched to Solu-Medrol (methylprednisolone) and received 1 course in Sep 2014. JCV serology was 
positive on an unknown date and a brain MRI performed on(b) (6)  was suggestive of PML suspicion 
therefore, the patient was hospitalized. According to the patient, she had presented with visual and speech disorder
which started a few days earlier. A lumbar puncture was planned on(b) (6)  and CSF samples will be sent to 
(b) (6)  for JCV DNA testing. The outcome for the event PML suspicion is unknown. The causality for the event of 
PML suspicion is unknown.  TYSABRI therapy was discontinued.  No further information was provided. French 
Imputability: C1S1I1

hospitalized and her clinical state was stable. JCV PCR testing came back negative from (b) (6)   However, PML 
suspicion was high due to results of MRI performed on (b) (6)   No other MRI had been performed since(b)(6)  
(b) (6)  CSF sample from lumbar puncture performed on(b) (6)  (previously reported was planned on (b)(6)  
(b) (6)  will be sent to (b) (6)  for additional JCV PCR testing.  Treatment included plasmatic exchanges; the patient 
should undergo her 7th and last plasmatic exchange on (b) (6) . TYSABRI was stopped in Jul 2014 (date 
discrepant).  Additional information was also provided on a (b) (6)  sample identification form, which included the 
following:  Patient's date of birth is (b) (6)  (discrepant from initial report); diagnosed with multiple sclerosis in 
1986; presented with dysphasia; total of 54 doses of TYSABRI; MRI (presumed from (b) (6) ) showed typical 
MS lesions and typical multifocal PML lesions; and treatment included plasmapheresis and maraviroc. No further 
information was reported.  French imputability: C1 S1 I1
Update 17 Nov 2014: The neurologist reported that clinical signs decreased.  JCV PCR testing (lumbar puncture 
performed on (b) (6) ) came back negative from (b) (6)  Despite JCV PCR testing result from (b) (6)  PML 
suspicion remained high according to the neurologist. No further information was given. French imputability : C1 S1 
I1
Update 23 Jan 2015: Follow-up information was received from the neurologist. FLAIR (MRI) images, which led to 
the diagnosis of PML, were provided (b) (6)  diagnosis of PML, Sep 2014: PML not seen, Jun 2014: PML not
seen, Mar 2014: nothing to see). According to the neurologist, it was not possible to conclude about the result of 
(b) (6)  for PCR of JC virus due to the insufficient volume of CSF sample. Until now, the patient refused the routine 
MRI and monitoring lumbar puncture. Norset (mirtazapine) and maraviroc were discontinued due to patient's 
decision. The patient had a low worsening of aphasia and apraxia. TYSABRI, initiated in Nov 2009 for MS, was 
discontinued in Jul 2014 for personal convenience due to intolerance to follow-up scan every 3 months and fear of 
a PML. The patient had a heavy past with immunosuppressives.
Update 23 Jan 2015: Follow-up information was received from the neurologist via a Suspect PML Data Collection 
Form.  The MS first signs appeared in 1996 and MS was diagnosed in 1996. The patient was previously treated 
with, Imurel (azathioprine) from unknown date to 1997 for MS, Tegeline (immunoglobulin) from Mar 1999 to Apr 
2000 for MS, Endoxan (cyclophosphamide) from May 2000 to Jul 2001 for MS, mitoxantrone from Jan 2002 to Feb 
2002 for MS, methotrexate from Jan 2005 to May 2005, Cellcept (mycophenolate mofetil) from 2006 to Feb 2009 
for MS and interferon beta during unknown period for MS. TYSABRI was started on 23-NOV-2009 and discontinued
on 17-JUL-2014 due to fear of PML. The patient received 57 infusions (one per month) with no interruption for 
greater than 3 months. On 13-FEB-2014, T4 lymphocytes were 1060/mL, T8 lymphocytes were 710/mL and the 
T4/T8 ration was 1.49. MRI prior to PML suspicion was performed on 25-SEP-2014. Prior to PML suspicion, MS 
symptoms were right leg paresis 4/5 MRC and visual disorder. The patient had been tested for serum anti-JCV 
antibody on (b) (6)  with a positive result and an index value at 4.15. The patient is currently at home.

FOIA Case Report Information
Regarding to the PML, the patient presented suggestive clinical symptoms of PML and these signs and symptoms 
prompted MRI revealed suspicion findings. The signs and symptoms which led to the evaluation for possible PML 
occured on 01-OCT-2014, and included dysphasia, blurred vision and dysesthesia on right hand.  MRI at the time 
of suspicion of PML was performed on(b) (6)  (result previously provided). A lumbar puncture was 
performed for PCR JCV testing on (b) (6)  The result returned negative from (b) (6)  and inconclusive from 
(b) (6)  however the (b) (6)  reports the results as Not detected; it appears the neurologist has interpreted this as 
inconclusive since the sample volume available to the (b) (6)  was minimal at 200ul, which did not allow for a repeat 
assay. No other CSF analysis was performed due to the patient's refusal. No brain biopsy performed. On (b) (6)
(b) (6)  at time of PML suspicion, absolute leukocyte count was 6800 and absolute lymphocyte count was 2810. PML
treatment included mirtazapine 15 mg, 4 times a day, started on(b) (6)  Celsentri (maraviroc) 
300mg,started on 26-JAN-2015 and G-CSF (granulocyte colony stimulating factor) 300 mcg per day from 10-OCT-
2014 to 15-NOV-2015. Additionally, 7 plasmatic exchanges were performed respectively on (b) (6) , (b)(6)
(b) (6) ,(b) (6) , (b) (6) , (b) (6) (b) (6)  and on (b) (6) . According to the 
neurologist, the PML is confirmed (MRI evolution). The patient has never been enrolled in study (Biogen Idec or 
other). French Imputability: C1S1I1.
Update 28 Jan 2015: Follow-up information was received from the neurologist indicating that testing for CSF JCV 
DNA was inconclusive due to insufficient volume of CSF.
Update 28 Jan 2015: Follow-up information received from the neurologist indicating that no lumbar puncture was 
planned as the patient refused.  No further information was provided.
Update 29 Jan 2015: Biogen considers this case high suspect and final call for PML based on presence of 
radiologic evidence but negative CSF for JCV; additionally, a repeat LP and or a brain biopsy is not planned and 
has been refused by the patient.
