MEDICALLY SIGNIFICANT
A study investigator reported that a 48 year old female patient on TYSABRI (300mg, IV, QM) since 23 Jun 2008 
and enrolled in the (b) (6)  was under investigation for suspected 
progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML). The indication for TYSABRI was relapsing remitting multiple 
sclerosis (RRMS), diagnosed on an unknown date). No medical history or concomitant medications were reported.
The patient's most recent TYSABRI infusion was on 08 Nov 2010. The patient was hospitalised on (b) (6)
due to suspect PML. Symptoms included massive disturbance of memory. No other details were provided.
The outcome of suspect PML was unknown. Causality was not assessed. Action taken with TYSABRI was 
unknown.
Update 26 Nov 2010: Additional information was received from the study investigator. It was reported that the MRI 
scans looked ''very PML'' but the results from the local Ulm lab returned negative at 200 copies/ml sensitivity only. 
The patient was reported to be in a stable condition. The investigator planned to discuss with the patient's doctor 
about performing another MRI (prior to patient discharge) at the weekend.
Update 06 Dec 2010: Additional information was received from the patient's treating physician. The patient was still 
hospitalised and "PML had been confirmed" (no details provided). The patient was undergoing plasmapheresis.
Update 09 Dec 2010: The result of JCV PCR on CSF performed at(b) (6)  was received.
The result showed 300 copies/ml. The clinical state of the patient was favourable and she would be carefully 
monitored. Plasma Exchange (PLEX) was going well.
This case is considered confirmed for PML.
Update 20 Dec 2010: The general health condition and cognition of the patient was good. After the last session of 
PLEX (date unknown) and being clinically stable, and after a control MRI (unknown date in (b) (6) ) which was 
unchanged in comparison to the previous MRI, the patient was dischanged home last week (unknown date in(b) (6)  
 The patient had weekly visits for clinical check-ups in the neurologic outpatient facility scheduled. The 
patient had been instructed to come in at any time if she felt any worsening or new neurological symptoms. In order
to prevent Immune Reconstitution Inflammatory Syndrome (IRIS), admission for prophylactic corticosteroid 
treatment was planned for Jan 2011.
Update 13 Apr 2011:On an unknown date in Feb 2011, the patient experienced IRIS (Immune Reconstitution 
Inflammatory Syndrome). The patient's clinical signs were severe cognitive impairment and motor impairment,

mainly affecting walking ability. The patient had been treated at a clinic with high dose steroids, mefloquine and 
mirtazapine. Mefloquine and mirtazapine had been discontinued on an unknown date. There was slow 
improvement. The patient was discharged home and was still at home at time of report. The neurologist did not 
provide a causality assessment between TYSABRI and IRIS.
Update 13 Dec 2011: Additional information was received from the investigator who reported that the patient past 
medication included Betaferon/betaseron (interferon beta 1-b) received from Sep 2006 to May 2008. The PML 
onset date was reported as 18 Nov 2010. The event was considered severe in intensity. The patient was 
discharged from hospital on (b) (6)
The investigator assessed the relatedness between PML and TYSABRI as related and considered that PML was a 
typical and rare side-effect of natalizumab. The outcome of PML was recovered with sequelae (date unspecified). 
TYSABRI was permanently discontinued on 08 Nov 2010. 
Update 25 Sep 2012: The study investigator reported via (b) (6)
that the patient was hospitalised on (b) (6)  to (b) (6)  and (b) (6)  and(b) (6)  due to severe 
status epilepticus (onsets (b) (6)  and (b) (6)  respectively). The events wereconsidered life-threatening 
and severe in intensity. The investigator assessed causality as related to TYSABRI since the patient had PML in 
Nov 2010 and ''that is the reason for the status epilepticus''. The patient recovered from the first episode of severe 
status epilepticus on 11 May 2011 and the second episode resolved on (b) (6)  TYSABRI remained 
discontinued (since 08 Nov 2010). 
Company Comment: Contribution of TYSABRI to severe status epilepticus has been assessed as related.
Update 04 Nov 2014: Additional information from the investigator reported that the female patient, enrolled in the 
(b) (6)  was hospitalized from(b) (6)  to (b) (6)  for generalized
epilepsy (onset (b) (6) ), which was considered severe. The patient's most recent TYSABRI infusion prior to 
the event onset was 08 Nov 2010. No relevant medical history or concomitant medications were reported.
It was reported that the patient had a severe generalized epileptic seizure. Testing and treatment for the event were
not provided.
The investigator considered the event of generalized epilepsy related to TYSABRI, noting that the "patient was ill 
with PML in November 2010 and that is the reason for her epilepsy." No action was taken with TYSABRI (previously
discontinued on 08 Nov 2010). At the time of this report, the outcome of the event generalized epilepsy was 
recovered with sequelae (sequelae not specified) on (b) (6)

FOIA Case Report Information
Update 23 Jan 2015: A report was received via the literature: Villar LM, Costa-Frossard L, Masterman T, Fernandez
O, Montalban X, Casanova B, et al. Lipid-specific IgM bands in CSF associated with a reduced risk of developing 
PML during treatment with natalizumab. Ann Neurol. 2015 Jan 7. doi: 10.1002/ana.24345. [Epub ahead of print]. 
The authors explored whether the presence of lipid-specific IgM oligoclonal bands in CSF (IgM bands), a 
recognized marker of highly inflammatory MS, may identify individuals better able to counteract the potential 
immunosuppressive effect of TYSABRI and hence be associated with a reduced risk of developing PML. Twenty 
four MS patients who developed PML and 343 patients who did not suffer this opportunistic infection during 
TYSABRI treatment were studied. All patients diagnosed with PML showed MRI findings suggestive of PML and a 
positive ultrasensitive quantitative PCR for JC virus in CSF. Twenty of them also showed progressive symptoms 
characteristic of PML. Patients were treated with TYSABRI for 2.77 years (SD +/- 1.58 years). Twenty two out of 
twenty four patients experienced immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS). Results: IgM bands 
independently associated with decreased PML risk (OR = 45.9, 95% CI: 5.9-339.3, p<0.0001) in patients treated 
with TYSABRI. They also associated with significantly higher CSF CD4, CD8 and B cell numbers. Patients positive 
for IgM bands and anti JC antibodies had similar level of reduced PML risk than those anti JC negative (OR = 1.55, 
95% CI: 0.09-25.2, p=1.0). The higher risk was observed in patients positive for anti JC antibodies and negative for 
IgM bands (19% of the total cohort, OR=59.71, CI: 13.6-262.2). Interpretation: The presence of IgM bands reflects 
a process which may diminish the risk of PML by counteracting the excess of immunosuppression that may occur 
during TYSABRI therapy. This case refers to a female patient who experienced PML and IRIS. TYSABRI therapy 
was discontinued. No further patient specific information was provided.
