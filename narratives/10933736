Medically Significant
A neurologist reported that a male patient on TYSABRI (300 mg, IV, QM) for MS from unknown date to unknown 
date experienced PML suspicion (onset unknown).  The patient did not have highly active MS but TYSABRI was 
started and the patient received a total of 15-16 infusions. The patient did not experience an interruption of 
TYSABRI for greater than three months. The patient was anti-JCV antibody positive at the start of TYSABRI 
treatment. Index at the start was 1.0, increased to 2.9 and further to 3.98 at the last test. MRI showed a lesion that 
was suspicious of PML and continued to grow even after TYSABRI was stopped.  PLEX was initiated. The outcome
for the event PML suspicion is unknown. PML is still under investigation. The causality for the event of PML 
suspicion was assessed as related.  TYSABRI therapy was discontinued.

Update 04 Feb 2015: Follow-up information indicated that the patient had CSF samples (sample date not known) 
analyzed at two local labs which returned negative result.  Sample will be tested at (b) (6)  as well.
Addendum: Update previously noted as 05 Feb 2015 was correctly received on 04 Feb 2015.  The patient had CSF 
samples (sample date not known) analyzed at two local labs which returned negative result; testing was performed 
three times total - twice at one local lab and once at a different local lab.
Update 19 Feb 2015: This case was received from the Norweigan Regulatory Agency (agency reference number: 
168053).  No further information was provided.
Update 25 Feb 2015: Follow-up information was received from the neurologist via a Suspect PML Data Collection 
Form. The patient had received no prior immunosuppressant therapy. The patient was being evaluated for PML 
due to clinical signs and symptoms (NOS). Lumbar puncture was performed (date not provided) and tested 
negative at two local laboratories as well as (b) (6)  Brain biopsy has not been performed. The neurologist still 
considers this highly suspect PML according to both clinical and MRI findings. The patient had initially presented 
with clinical symptoms (NOS) that were also seen on MRI. MRI images were reviewed at the treating hospital and a
reference hospital. It was unknown if the MRI was routine or if it was performed as a result of the clinical suspicion. 
The patient was improving, but does still have substantial hemiparesis and is scheduled to see the treating 
neurologist again on 04 [Mar 2015].
Update 05 Mar 2015: Follow-up information was received from the physician, via a Suspect PML Data Collection 
Form. The patient was further identified via initials and date of birth. Relapsing Remitting MS was diagnosed on 25 
Aug 1999. MS disease symptoms prior to suspected PML included bilateral facial palsy (onset 15 May 1999) which 
was in complete remission. Prior immunomodulatory therapy included Rebif (interferon beta-1a) from 30 Nov 2000 
to 30 Apr 2012 and Gilenya (fingolimod) from 31 Mar 2013 to 18 Jul 2013. The patient was previously enrolled in 
non-Biogen Idec Clinical Trial (b) (6) ) in 2003. Suspect product was confirmed as TYSABRI (300 mg, Q4W) 
administered from 09 Sep 2014 to 11 Dec 2014. The patient did not experience an interruption of TYSABRI therapy
for greater than 3 months. Prior to starting TYSABRI, on 09 Sep 2013, leukocyte count was 6.2 x10^9/L (reference 
range 3.5-8.8 x10^9/L), lymphocyte count was 4.1 x10^9/L (reference range 0.9-2.9 x10^9/L), and ALAT was 150 
U/ml (reference range 0-70). While on TYSABRI, prior to PML suspicion, on 17 Sep 2014, leukocyte count was 7.4 
x10^9/L (reference range 3.5-8.8 x10^9/L) and lymphocyte count was 3.0 x10^9/L (reference range 0.9-2.9 
x10^9/L). The patient was evaluated for PML due to signs and symptoms including hemiparesis right side with 
myoclonus (onset 15 Nov 2014). MRI at the time of PML suspicion was performed on 18 Dec 2014. At the time of 
PML suspicion, on 18 Dec 2014, pre-PLEX, leukocyte count was 9.4 x10^9/L (reference range 3.5-8.8 x10^9/L) and
lymphocyte count was 3.6 x10^9/L (reference range 0.9-2.9 x10^9/L). Lumbar puncture performed on 18 Dec 2014 
tested negative for CSF JCV DNA at local laboratory. CSF analysis was abnormal. Lumbar puncture performed on

29 Dec 2014 tested negative/inconclusive for CSF JCV DNA at local laboratory. Lumbar puncture performed on 15 
Jan 2015 tested negative for CSF JCV DNA at (b) (6)  Brain biopsy has not been performed. The patient received 
treatment with plasma exchange (PLEX), three sessions on 15 Jan 2015 (volume 4307 ml), 16 Jan 2015 (4130 ml),
and 18 Jan 2015 (3968 ml). The patient received corticosteroids (NOS; QD) for possible IRIS. The patient is 
currently at home. The status summary indicated that it was "likely that he will recover with a marked right sided 
hemiparesis. Right hand is useless." Based on the neurologist's evaluation, PML is very likely but not confirmed.
Update 10 Mar 2015: The reporting physician indicated that MRIs from 18 Dec 2014, 23 Dec 2014, and 30 Dec 
2014 were compatible with PML and MRIs from 13 Jan 2015 and 03 Feb 2015 were compatible with PML and IRIS.
 No older MRIs were available for comparison. According to medical records, the patient started TYSABRI in Aug 
Update 13 Mar 2015: Follow-up information included MRI images provided for the following dates: 17 Dec 2014, 23 
Dec 2014, 30 Dec 2014, 13 Jan 2015 and 03 Feb 2015.
Update 10 Mar 2015: Follow-up information received included MRI and laboratory test reports. On 12 Dec 2014, 
laboratory tests showed leukocytes at 8.6 x10^9/L, neutrophils at 4.4 x10^9/L, lymphocytes increased at 3.3 
x10^9/L, and ALAT increased at 114 U/L. On 17 Dec 2014 the patient underwent MRI. There were no previous 
images available for comparison. The result was described as confluent T2 high signal changes in frontal parietal 
transition left side as described. There was question as to whether it was new or PML and previous MRI images 
were needed for comparison. CSF analysis on 18 Dec 2014 showed leukocytes at <5 x10^6/L, increased protein at 
0.87 g/L, increased albumin at 918 mg/L, increased albumin ratio at 19, increased IgG at 63 mg/L, and tested 
negative for BK virus. On 18 Dec 2014, laboratory tests showed leukocytes increased at 9.4 x10^9/L, neutrophils at 
5.0 x10^9/L, lymphocytes increased at 3.6 x10^9/L, and ALAT increased at 74 U/L. On 23 Dec 2014 the patient 
underwent MRI. The result was described as no progression of T2 high signal changes in left hemisphere. CSF 
analysis on 29 Dec 2014 showed increased leukocytes at 5 x10^6/L, increased protein at 1.2 g/L, increased 
albumin at 404 mg/L and increased IgG at 40 mg/L. On 30 Dec 2014 the patient underwent MRI, which was 
expedited as the patient had further increasing symptoms. The result was described as unchanged, no progression 
of T2 high signal changes or contrast enhancement in white matter front parietal left side. On 12 Jan 2015, 
laboratory tests showed leukocytes at 8.1 x10^9/L, ALAT increased at 71 U/L. On 13 Jan 2015 the patient 
underwent MRI. The result was described as pathological signal deviation pre central with acquired progression 
related to location, signal intensity and increased upload in addition to increased degree of contrast upgrade. The 
result was well compatible with PML-IRIS. On 14 Jan 2015, laboratory tests showed leukocytes at 7.6 x10^9/L, 
neutrophils at 4.3 x10^9/L, lymphocytes at 2.6 x10^9/L, and ALAT at 58 U/L. CSF analysis on 15 Jan 2015 showed 
leukocytes at <5 x10^6/L, increased protein at 0.59 g/L, albumin at 304 mg/L and IgG at 33 mg/L. On 18 Jan 2015, 
laboratory tests showed leukocytes increased at 10.8 x10^9/L, neutrophils increased at 8.3 x10^9/L, and

lymphocytes at 1.7 x10^9/L. On 19 Jan 2015, laboratory tests showed leukocytes increased at 11.2 x10^9/L. On 03 
Feb 2015 the patient underwent MRI. The result was described as general progress of signal changes with spotted 
contrast enhancement. Image and the development over a short period can be compatible with IRIS. On 04 Feb 
2015, laboratory tests showed leukocytes increased at 9.6 x10^9/L and ALAT increased a 93 U/L. On 11 Feb 2015,
laboratory tests showed leukocytes increased at 10.3 x10^9/L. On 13 Feb 2015, laboratory tests showed leukocytes
increased at 10.1 x10^9/L
Update 20 Mar 2015: Follow-up information received from the neurologist indicated that although the PML 
diagnosis for this patient now probably never will be confirmed virally, they found the clinical and radiological image 
of the PML so clear that unless the clinical status of the patient changed they would not pursue further invasive 
diagnostics in this patient. They will manage this as PML and pursue further diagnostic work-up.
Update 26 Mar 2015: Biogen considers this case high suspect and final call due to positive MRI and negative CSF.
Update 26 May 2015: Follow-up information was received from a radiologist regarding this 47 year old patient who 
had MS for 15 years and had used natalizumab for 18 months. JC DNA was not detected at diagnosis. The PML 
presented with the symptoms: right side affected, gait disorder, slurred speech and reduced power. The patient had
6 MRIs on a period of 3.5 months. The patient also experienced immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome 
(IRIS) (onset unknown). The outcome of both PML and IRIS were unknown. No treatment or testing was reported. 
The events were considered related to TYSABRI.
Update 07 Jul 2015: Follow-up information was received from the treating neurologist who provided dates and 
corrected index results of anti-JCV antibody analysis performed at (b) (6)  Denmark for the patient prior to PML 
diagnosis. On 14 Jul 2014 the result was 1.106 (previously stated as 1.0), 17 Sep 2014 the result was 2.03 
(previously stated as 2.9), on 18 Dec 2014 the result was 3.89 (previously stated as 3.98). The neurologist also 
reported that another anti-JCV antibody analysis was done on 9 Sep 2013, the index-result of this analysis was 1.7.
