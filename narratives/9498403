This case was reported by a physician, via a sales representative, and described the occurrence of stroke like 
symptoms in a 41-year-old female patient who received Belimumab (Benlysta) solution for injection over a period of
48 weeks for systemic lupus erythematosus. 
Concurrent medical conditions included systemic lupus erythematosus. Concurrent medications included 
Methotrexate and cyclophosphamide (Cytoxan). 
On August 2012 the patient started Belimumab (intravenous infusion). At an unknown time after starting 
Belimumab, the patient experienced stroke like symptoms, inability to walk, viral infection, drooling, speech difficulty
and inability to speak. The patient was hospitalised and referred to a neurologist. She was diagnosed as "having a 
rare viral infection affecting her organs".  Treatment with Belimumab was discontinued. The patient was discharged
to home with hospice care.  At the time of reporting, the events were unresolved.
Follow-up information was received from a physician on 29 October 2013. Concurrent medications included 
mycophenolate mofetil (Mycophenolic acid), corticosteroid (Corticosteroids). On (b) (6)  the patient experienced
progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, lupus cerebritis and jc virus. The patient was hospitalised. In (b) (6)  
(b) (6)  the patient developed neurological symptoms preliminarily diagnosed as lupus cerebritis. Treatment with 
Belimumab was discontinued in(b) (6)  (after the 10th infusion). Treatment with Mycophenolic acid ("MMF") was
continued for "about a month or so" after the Belimumab was discontinued. The patient was given intravenous 
Cyclophosphamide and high dose corticosteroids as treatment for the lupus cerebritis. The patient's condition

deteriorated with further neurological decline. On an unspecified date, the patient's cerebrospinal fluid was checked
for JC virus and a very high JC virus load was detected in her cerebrospinal fluid. Treatment with Belimumab was 
discontinued. At the time of reporting, the outcome of the events was unknown and it was reported that the patient 
is no longer in the hospital and is not doing well.
Follow-up information was received on 30 October 2013 from the physician. It was reported that the patient was on 
Benlimumab for 10 months (previously reported as 11 months). On an unknown date, the patient experienced 
progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy. At the time of reporting, the outcome of the event was fatal. The 
patient died from progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy. It is unknown whether an autopsy was performed.
Follow-up information was received from one of the patient's physicians on 07 November 2013. Concurrrent 
medications included mycophenolate mofetil and steroids. On an unknown date the patient experienced could not 
swallow, swollen jaw, swelling of face, lump in throat (nos), facial droop, lupus cerebritis and JC Virus. The 
physician reported the patient had 10 exposures to Belimumab and was on mycophenolate mofetil and unspecified 
steroids. Cyclophosphamide was added at an unknown time. The physician reported the initial presentation of the 
patient's progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy was to the patient's primary care physician with the feeling 
that she could not swallow, her jaw was swollen, and "her tongue felt like she could not talk well." She was given 
unspecified antibiotics and referred to an ENT. 1 1/2 weeks later she presented to the reporting physician with the 
same symptoms. On an unknown date the patient developed a facial droop. The physician thought it was SLE 
cerebritis and "upped" the patient's steroids (unspecified) and sent the patient for an MRI, CAT and LP. The LP 
came back acellular and the CSF was positive for JC Virus. The MRI was consistent with progressive multifocal 
leukoencephalopathy. The patient continued treatment with mycophenolate mofetil after treatment with Belimumab 
was discontinued. Treatment with unspecified steroids and cyclophosphamide were ongoing at the time of the 
consult to a neurologist. No additional information was reported.
Follow-up information was received from one of the patient's physicians on 11 November 2013. Co-suspect 
medications included CellCept (mycophnolate mofetil). Concurrent medications included Mycophenolate, 
Solumedrol and Acthar gel. The physician stated "Benlysta started August 2012 through 06 April 2013 (the 
previously reported stop date was July 2013). Her symptoms started in the first part of April and as far as we 
understand it, relentlessly progressive despite stopping CellCept until we met her at the end of August. Her other
immunosppression was: Mycophenolate 1500 BID (spring or summer of 2012 through late June 2013), Cytoxan x2 
doses (June and July 2013) and high dose steroids (3 day 1 g solumedrol pulse in May, then again in June 2013 
and acthar gel pulse x14 days in August)". No additional information was reported.

FOIA Case Report Information
The authors diagnosed progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) in the patient with SLE who was on 
belimumab. She had received a total of 10 monthly belimumab infusions from August 2012 through April 2013, 
during which time she was also taking mycophenolate mofetil and low-dose prednisone. In (b) (6)  she 
developed progressive neurologic decline with prominent bulbar weakness and episodic dystonic posturing, 
tachycardia, and hypertension. In(b) (6)  she was hospitalized at another institution and diagnosed with central 
nervous system (CNS) lupus based in part on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain. She was treated 
with high-dose steroids and two cycles of cyclosphosphamide but continued to decline. On admission to our 
hospital in (b) (6)  repeat MRI of the brain showed increased multifocal, confluent areas of T2 hyperintensity 
in the bilateral white matter. 
Serum testing showed normal levels of CD3 and CD8 cells but undetectable CD19 (less than 18X10^6/l) cells and 
low CD4 (282X10^6/l) cells. Serum testing for HIV was negative. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) JCV PCR was positive 
(12,400 copies/ ml), and CSF white blood cell count was 0 (0X10^6/l). The patient was tapered off prednisone over 
2 weeks; all other immunosuppression was held.
The patient was scheduled for follow-up clinical assessment and neuroimaging in 1 month. Unfortunately, she 
passed away several weeks later, in (b) (6)
The author commented, "Based on the patient's clinically mild SLE and the timing of symptom onset, belimumab 
likely played a key role in the development of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy= (PML)."
