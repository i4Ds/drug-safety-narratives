(b) (6)  based on information received by Pfizer from Roche, Manufacturer control number 1429133.
AER 1429133 is an interventional study case, received on 02Jul2014 from an  oncologist and concerns a 66 year 
old female patient (patient number: (b) (6) )  who experienced physical weakness, fever and suspected 
progressive multifocal  leukoencephalopathy while enrolled in study (b) (6)
 Medical history included a 5cm X 3cm large ulcerated basalion on the nose and the patient

zoster, opportunistic infections, cytomegalovirus pneumocystic   carinii pneumonia, known central nervous system 
(CNS) lupus or lymphoma and it was unknown if he had a history  of herpes simplex infection. No complications of 
previous immunosupressive and chemotherapy Concurrent  conditions included basal cell carcinoma of right part of
nose, left common femoral vein thrombosis,   peripherally inserted central catheterization. Concomitant medications

lenograstim, addel N and cernevit. On 28Mar2014, the patient was diagnosed with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma 
(DLBCL). Excisional or Incisional  biopsy of peripheral nymph node was performed with CD20 positive expression. 
No brain MRI, biopsy and JC virus in cerebrospinal fluid was done. The informed consent of the patient was 
conducted on 07Apr2014 and was randomized in the Arm A of the study. On 08Apr2014, the patient started 
intravenous rituximab (IV) (visit 1)  injection at 668 mg (lot number: 1107135) (frequency every 2 or 3 weeks) once 
in cycle 1. On 09Apr2014, she received therapy with intravenous cyclophosphamide 1404mg, intravenous 
doxorubicin 94mg, intravenous vincristine 2mg and oral prednisone 500mg (form and frequency not reported). On 
22Apr2014, she received   subcutaneous rituximab (visit 2) 1400 mg (both actual total dose and dose intended). On
07May2014, she  received subcutaneous rituximab (visit 3) 1400 mg (both actual total dose and dose intended). On
21May2014,  she received subcutaneous rituximab (visit 4) 1400 mg (both actual total dose and dose intended). On
22May2014, therapy with cyclophosphamide and doxorubicin was interrupted. On 02Jun2014, she was treated  with
oral dipyrone (Metamizol) 20 drops, every 8 hours and oral tramadol 20 drops, every 8 hours for pain because of 
oral mucositis. On the same day, she was also treated for oral mucositis with oral amphotericin B 1mL, every 8 
hours, oral benzydamine hydrochloride 15 mL, every 8 hours and oral lidocaine hydrochloride   (lidocaine spray) 1 
puff, as required. On 11Jun2014, she received intravenous rituximab (visit 6) 668 mg  (both actual total dose and 
dose intended). On the same day, the treatment with dipyrone, tramadol, amphotericin B, benzydamine 
hydrochloride and lidocaine hydrochloride were stopped. On 12Jun2014, therapy   with cyclophosphamide 1312mg 
and doxorubicin 87mg was restarted. On 13Jun2014, therapy with cyclophosphamide   and doxorubicin was 
interrupted. Later, she developed physical weakness and suspected progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy in 
Jun2014. On(b) (6)  she came to the hospital for her rituximab dose and was  subsequently hospitalized as an 
inpatient due to the generalised physical weakness. On (b) (6)  she received intravenous rituximab (visit 7) 669 
mg (both actual total dose and dose intended). Subsequently, she received most recent dose of intravenous 
rituximab prior to the event and she started treatment with intravenous electrolyte solution NOS infusion 1000 ml 
daily, intravenous hyperalimentation 4.4% 1000 ml daily,  intravenous electrolytes NOS/trace elements NOS 1 
ampoule and intravenous vitamins NOS 1 ampoule in response to   the event. Weight control showed a further 
weight loss (in total from May2014 till now about 10 kg), therefore parenteral nutrition was started and laboratory 
showed no clinical significant findings. On (b) (6)   therapy with cyclophosphamide and doxorubicin was 
restarted. On (b) (6)  therapy with cyclophosphamide, vincristine and doxorubicin was interrupted. On 
(b) (6)  her leukocyte count was 6.37/NL (3.98 to 10.04),  hemoglobin was 9.8 g/dl (11.2 to 15.7), platelet count 
was 338/NL (182 to 369) and therapy with prednisone was   interrupted. After completion of 6 cycles of 
chemotherapy on (b) (6)  she developed grade 2 fever (about 39.2 degree celsius) which led to prolonged 
hospitalization. Same day, she was prescribed once intravenous gentamicin sulfate at 320 mg once a day, 
intravenous ceftriaxone at 2gm once a day, oral paracetamol at 500 mg  as needed and intravenous piperacillin 
sodium/tazobactam sodium 4.5 g, every 8 hours and her blood culture aerobe and anaerobe was performed, after 5
days of incubation it showed negative. On (b) (6)  CT scan resulted a slight decrease of brain matter bi frontal 
and slight microangiopathic leukoencephalopathy periventricular. Clinically it was rather an early demetial syndrome

(confirmed by psychiatricians) developed in the last few weeks. Leukoencephalopathy was a discreet suspicion in 
the computer tomography in head. She was not able to look after herself and needed regular help in everyday life. 
On (b) (6)  she received   intravenous rituximab (visit 8) 625 mg (both actual total dose and dose intended). On 
(b) (6)  fever and  physical weakness were improved and treatment with piperacillin sodium/tazobactam sodium
was discontinued and  she received treatment with oral sultamicillin 750 mg, every 12 hours. On(b) (6)
treatment with  sultamicillin was discontinued. Later, the event physical weakness was improved. It was stated that 
in the  last weeks she had a cognitive decline, psychiatric analysis showed a memory and concentration impairment
with  episodes of confusion. On (b) (6)  suspected progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy became serious
and therapy with rituximab was permanently discontinued. At the time of this report, suspected progressive 
multifocal leukoencephalopathy was persisting. 
The oncologist considered the event suspected progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy as serious (did not
provide the seriousness criteria) and probably related with rituximab (IV), rituximab (SC) and with protocol  related 
procedure (chemotherapy) and assessed the physical weakness and fever as possibly related to rituximab (IV), 
rituximab (SC) and a protocol related procedure (physical weakness after 6 cycles of chemotherapy).
The company assessed the event suspected progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy as medically significant.

Pfizer statement: The investigator assessment of the causal relationship of the SAEs physical weakness and fever 
with doxorubicin was not provided at the time of this report. Since no determination has been received, the case is 
managed as if the investigator's assessment was that a reasonable possibility exists that the event was related to 
doxorubicin, as a cautionary measure and for reporting purposes.
