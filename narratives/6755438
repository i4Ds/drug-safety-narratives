This is a SU011248 report from a Pfizer clinical trial. A 65-year-
o , Asian, male subjec was enro ed in the above-mentioned trial and started to receive SU011248, 50 mg daily on 
20Aug2008. The subject also received pemetrexed sodium hydrate 790 mg every 3 weeks on 20Aug2008. The 
subject had a medical history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, glaucoma, open lung biopsy, upper lung 
lobectomy, postoperative pneumothorax, and pleural effusion. He was initially assessed as having a medical history 
of carcinomatous pleurisy, which was ruled out by further investigation, while postoperative pneumothorax and 
pleural effusion were confirmed by computed tomography on 06Aug2008. Relevant concomitant medications 
included oral voglibose, oral glimepiride, oral amlodipine besilate, oral Panvitan powder (multivitamins) from 
13Aug2008 and ophthalmic latanoprost from 04Jan2002. It was confirmed that the subject had been prescribing 
voglibose, glimepiride and amlodipine besilate before 21Jul2008 from other hospital. On 27Aug2008 (cycle 1, 
day8), body temperature was 36.4 degrees centigrade. There was no significant abnormality. On 29Aug2008 the 
subject experienced pyrexia. The subject had pyrexia of maximum 38 degrees centigrade from the noon of 
29Aug2008 and he presented to the site on 30Aug2008 (cycle 1, day11). The subject also complained of right lower 
precordial pain compatible with the lesion of pneumothorax that he had prior to the study. White blood cell count 
was 3900, neutrophil percentage was 66% (neutrophil count was 2574), haemoglobin was 14.2, platelet count was 
96000, C-reactive protein was 1.48 and Sp02 was 97. Chest x-ray showed no finding of pneumonia which was 
obviously suspected. The subject was followed with receiving acetaminophen as needed. On 01Sep2008 the 
subject presented to the site again because he continued to have pyrexia of 38 degrees centigrade and right lower 
precordial pain. His performance status was 1, and Sp02 was 97. White blood cell count was 4100, neutrophil 
percentage was 77.8% (neutrophil count was 3189.8), hemoglobin was 13.8, platelet count was 52000, C-reactive 
protein was 11.1. Computed tomography showed recurrent right postoperative pneumothorax and the increasing 
tendency of right pleural effusion and interlobar pleural effusion. A bacterial test of pleural fluid was performed on 
and was negative. Although there was no evidence of pneumonia, the subject was admitted to the 
hospital for further investigation and monitoring. Body temperature at the admission and 7pm was 37.9 and 39.1 
degrees centigrade, respectively. Thoracentesis was performed to investigate pleural effusion in order to identify 
the cause of pyrexia. Events pneumothorax aggravated and pleural effusion increased were experienced on 
1111111111111111as pneumothorax aggravated and pleural effusion increased were observed by chest, abdomen and 
pelvic computed tomography conducted on! The subject started to receive loxoprofen sodium hydrate 
and rebamipide three times daily from the evening of 01Sep2008. He started to receive cefepime dihydrochloride 
hydrate for prophylaxis and continued to receive the study drug. On 02Sep2008 (cycle 1, day 14), the subject 
completed cycle 1 of SU011248 administration. Body temperature at Gam and 10am was 36.4 and 38.0 degrees 
centigrade, respectively. The subject took loxoprofen sodium hydrate and rebamipide. He had mild pain. Body 
temperature at 2pm was 37.3 degrees centigrade. On 411111111111, body temperature at 3:50am and 5:32am was 
38.2 and 38.3 degrees centigrade, respectively. The subject received cooling treatment. At 6am, body temperature 
was 37.9 degrees centigrade. The subject took loxoprofen sodium hydrate and rebamipide receiving cooling

treatment. On 11.1111111 body temperature at 2am and 3:30am was 37.8 and 38.1 degrees centigrade, 
respectively. The subject took loxoprofen sodium hydrate and rebamipide. During daytime, the subject's body 
temperature was from 36 to 37 degrees centigrade. Cefepime dihydrochloride hydrate was discontinued on 
05Sep2008. On 08Sep2008 (cycle 1, day 20), loxoprofen sodium hydrate was replaced by acetaminophen three 
times daily. Chest, abdomen and pelvic Computed tomography on 08Sep2008 showed that right postoperative 
pneumothorax had improved and right pleural effusion had decreased. According to lab data, the value of C-
reactive protein was decreasing. On 4111111111.the subject recovered from pneumothorax and pleural effusion. 
From 09Sep2008, the subject received acetaminophen as needed if pyrexia reached 38 degrees centigrade. At 
6am on ody temperature was 36.5 degrees centigrade so the investigator assessed that the subject 
recovert1,111Py1r1e1x1tia on MIMI No action Was taken with SU011248 and pemetrexed sodium hydrate in 
response to the events. The investigator's comment was as follows. From cycle 1 day 10, the subject had 
continuous pyrexia of more than 38 degrees centigrade although his performance status was well. The cause of 
pyrexia was explored by imaging procedures such as chest x-ray and computed tomography and pleural fluid 
analysis including bacterial culture and cytology. However, significant infection was not identified and progression of 
underlying disease (lung cancer) was not observed. The administration of SU011248 was completed until cycle 1 
day 14 and the subject was followed-up with receiving conservative treatment. From cycle 1 day 21, the pyrexia 
was recovering without antipyretic, and significant improve of right pneumothorax and pleural effusion was 
confirmed by chest x-ray. The value of C-reactive protein also decreased. Based on the clinical course, the 
investigator considered that the subject developed pleural effusion increased (non-infective and non-malignant) 
accompanied by that postoperative pneumothorax was aggravated. However,the investigator assessed that a 
causal relationship between the events and both study drugs could not be ruled out. The investigator considered 
there was a reasonable possibility that the events pyrexia, pneumothorax aggravated, and pleural effusion 
increased, were related to the study medications SU011248 and pemetrexed sodium hydrate. Follow-up 
(09Sep2008): The adverse event term was changed to "pneumothorax aggravated" and "pleural effusion 
increased" from "right lower precordial pain" as previously reported. Additional information on the investigator's 
causality assessment, clinical course, concomitant drugs and medical history was provided. (09Sep2008) This 
follow-up contains medically significant information. New events were added. Additional information on the 
investigator's causality assessment, clinical course, concomitant drugs and medical history was provided. Follow-
up (16Sep2008 and 19Sep2008): New information includes outcome and stop date of the event pyrexia, the 
investigator's causality assessment between the events and pemetrexed, action taken with pemetrexed, medical 
history, clinical course, concomitant drugs, lab tests results. This follow-up contains medically significant 
information.  Follow up (020ct2008): New information reported included onset date of serious adverse events 
pneumothorax aggravated and pleural effusion increased, information about start dates of concomitant drugs 
voglibose, glimepiride and amlodipine besilate.  Follow up (020ct2008): This follow-up contains medically 
significant information, including onset date of the events pneumothorax aggravated and pleural effusion increased, 
information about start dates of concomitant drugs. Follow-up (020ct2008): Additional information amended the

dose information of pemetrexed sodium hydrate from 500 mg/m2 (per body surface area) to 790 mg per body. 
This follow-up contains medically significant information.  Company Clinical Evaluation There is not a reasonable 
possibility that the three reported serious events (pyrexia, pneumothorax aggravated, pleural effusion increased) 
are causally related to the study drugs SU011248 and pemetrexed, or to any clinical trial procedure. The disease 
under study provides a more reasonable explanation for these events.
