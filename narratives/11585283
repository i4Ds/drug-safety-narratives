FOIA Case Report Information
On 11-JAN-2016, the neonate was status post ventriculoperitoneal shunt and myelomeningocoele repair in stable 
condition.
Causality assessment for the events of hydrocephalus and myelomeningocoele was reported as related to 
TRUVADA.
Follow-up reports received from the (b) (6)  on 29 Jan 2016: (b) (6)  number added to case (84312). No new Safety 
information received.
Follow-up reports received from the (b) (6)  on 12 and 15 Feb 2016: The (b) (6)  
provided its evaluation, cannot rule out a possible association. Neural tube defect noted prenatally, dating not 
provided. The two defects (myelomeningocele with hydrocephalus) were combined as a single item. Spina bifida 
and anencephaly occur by 28 days after conception as a failure of the neural tube to close completely. Spina bifida 
of the myelomeningocele type is usually associated with backwards displacement of the cerebellum and posterior 
portion of the brain (A Chiari malformation) which then results in hydrocephalus. There is a known association with 
maternal folic acid deficiency.
