A neurologist spontaneously reported that a female patient on TYSABRI (300 mg, IV, QM) for Multiple Sclerosis 
from unknown date to unknown date experienced suspected PML (onset unknown).  The patient received 16 
TYSABRI infusions. Prior to receiving the next infusion the patient showed a suspect clinical picture and an MRI 
showed a suspect lesion that was suggestive of PML. On 17 Oct 2013 a CSF sample will be sent to (b) (6)  lab to 
detect JCV DNA presence.  The outcome for the event suspected PML is unknown. The causality for the event of 
suspected PML is unknown.  It is unknown if TYSABRI treatment is ongoing.
Update 21 Oct 2013: The neurologist provided follow-up for the 48 year old female patient diagnosed with suspect 
PML on 20 Sep 2013. The patient was on TYSABRI from 11 Jun 2012 to 12 Sep 2013. It was reported that the first

motor and focal symptoms were observed on 20 Sep 2013 with the patient's right hand movement impaired. The 
last MRI before the PML diagnosis was performed on 22 May 2013 and the last MRI performed at the time of PML 
diagnosis was obtained on 14 Oct 2013.  The patient is currently at home and it was reported she has not 
experienced an interruption in TYSABRI therapy for a time period greater than 3 months. TYSABRI therapy had 
been discontinued. 
Update 22 Oct 2013: The neurologist spontaneously reported the anti-JCV antibody status was positive (date of test
not provided).
Update 23 Oct 2013: The treating neurologist reported he is still suspecting PML diagnosis due to clinical and 
radiological picture. The Focus test (JCV DNA in CSF) gave a negative result and the neurologist is evaluating 2 
frozen CSF samples to (b) (6)  lab.
Update 29 Oct 2013: Follow-up was provided from the National Pharmacovigilance network (ID:222097) and it was 
reported the event of suspect PML started on 14 Oct 2013 (discrepant from previous report). An MRI was 
performed on 14 Oct 2013 that reveled PML lesions. TYSABRI therapy was discontinued and no improvements 
were observed after that.
Update 30 Oct 2013: The neurologist reported that the patient was treated with Rebif from 2001 until 2010 for 
RRMS.
Update 05 Nov 2013: The treating neurologist reported that the patient was stable on 28 Oct 2013. The next MRI 
will be performed in Nov 2013. The patient underwent two PLEX cycles (23 Oct and 25 Oct) but she has not yet 
received PO steroid therapy due to the stable clinical conditions. The EDSS score was 2.5. In case the neurologist 
would like to test the CSF sample at (b) (6)  lab, 2 CSF samples that were drawn in Oct 2013 were kept frozen; but
prior to sending the CSF to (b) (6)  the neurologist would like the patient to undergo a new MRI and would like to 
see if the patient has any clinical improvement after the steroid therapy. 
Update 15 Nov 2013: An update was received from the National Pharmacovigilance Network providing a report on 
the clinical condition of the patient. The patient was affected with RRMS since 2000. She was treated with 
interferon beta 1a from 2001 to Sep 2010 with frequent interruption. TYSABRI was started on 11 Jun 2012 (16 
infusions until 12 Sep 2013). The patient tested positive for the presence of antibody anti-JCV. A recent MRI dated 
22 May 2013 showed a stable general lesion burden without any active areas. About 1 week after the 12 Sep 2013 
infusion, a motor impairment of the lower limb and increased urinary urgency with incontinence was present. An 
objective evaluation confirmed such worsening of the clinical and neurological picture (EDSS value was 3.5). The 
scheduled infusion of TYSABRI was not administered and an MRI was performed. Such MRI compared to the

previous one performed in May 2013 showed a lesion in the left hemisphere suggestive of PML. On 17 Oct 2013 a 
lumbar puncture was performed and the CSF sample tested negative for the presence of JC virus DNA. The patient
underwent 2 sessions of plasmapheresis on 23 Oct 2013 and 25 Oct 2013, but no steroid therapy was started. The 
patient referred persistence of reduced functionality of the right hand with writing difficulties and mild improvement 
of sphincter impairment; a neurological evaluation showed EDSS value of 2.5. On 13 Nov 2013 the patient 
underwent a MRI which showed an increase of the known lesion in size, without any pathological contrast 
enhancement. Such lesion maintained strongly PML suggestive features; therefore the PML diagnosis is probable. 
The patient continued to be under close clinical observation in order to decide about any further treatment.
Update 28 Nov 2013: The treating neurologist reported that the patient underwent a clinical evaluation on 18 Nov 
2013 which showed a clear worsening of the paretic hand. An MRI was obtained on 13 Nov 2013 that revealed a 
worsening of known lesions which were increased in size. The symptoms were diagnosed as a strong suspect of 
PML that still remains. The clinicians are evaluating the possibility to ship 2 frozen CSF samples to the (b) (6)  labs.
Update 18 Dec 2013: The treating neurologist reported that the results of the MRI performed on 13 Nov 2013 in 
comparison with the previous MRI showed a larger extension of a lesion located in the left parietal region in cortical 
subcortical area. The size of the sulci, ventricles and cisterns and the thickness of the corpus callosum were 
unchanged. After administration of contrast medium, no pathological changes were observed. All other findings 
were unchanged.
Update 28 Dec 2013: The treating neurologist reported a new MRI was performed on 15 Dec 2013 and the results 
were unchanged when compared to previous MRI.
Update 31 Dec 2013: An update was entered through the National Pharmacovigilance Network: Lombardia regional
centre assessed the relationship between TYSABRI and the event suspected PML as probable, according to the 
Naranjo algorithm. No further information was provided. 
Update 07 Jan 2014: The treating neurologist reported that he is going to ship 2 frozen CSF samples to the (b) (6)  
lab. On 30 Dec 2013 the neurologist saw the patient and observed a worsening of the upper limb plegia and a 
worsening of the lower limb as for de-ambulation. The last MRI performed at the end of Dec 2013 showed 
unchanged lesions compared to the previous exam but the neurologist noticed some faded edges suggesting IRIS.
Update 28 Jan 2014: Follow-up was received from the Italian regulatory agency (agency reference number: 
222097) reporting that the patient had an MRI on 16 Dec 2013 which showed signs suggesting disease reactivation
(mild enhancement) while the lesion which was highly suggestive of PML, remained unchanged in size. A further 
clinical picture worsening occurred as the right limbs showed an accentuated motor impairment. The patient then

underwent a steroid treatment which led to an improvement of the right upper limb functionality.  A new 
rachicentesis was performed (date not provided) in order to detect JCV DNA presence and the results are pending.
Update 05 Feb 2014: Follow-up was received from Italian National Pharmacovigilance Network agency (agency 
reference number 222097) reporting that JCV DNA was tested present (13 copies/ml) from 1 new CSF sample on 
an unknown date. The diagnosis of PML defined with the neurological results (reduced functional use of the right 
upper limb) was confirmed. The patient's clinical condition is discretely improving.
Update 06 Feb 2014: A neurologist reported via a Biogen Idec employee (Medical Science Liaison) that the CSF 
sample used to test JCV DNA was drawn on 14 Jan 2014 and tested at (b) (6)  The lab report also indicated a DNA 
mutation in the sequence codifying VP1 protein. 
Update 11 Feb 2014: Upon internal review, Biogen Idec considers this case to be confirmed for PML based on the 
clinical symptoms, positive CSF, and MRI findings.
Update 14 Feb 2014: A neurologist clarified and provided the (b) (6)  lab results via a Biogen Idec employee (Medical 
Science Liaison). The previously reported positive CSF results (13 copies/mL) were in fact for the CSF sample 
collected on 17 Oct 2013 (MVGS 1420-1) and the JCV is consistent with variant most commonly associated with 
PML. The CSF sample from the second lumbar puncture on 14 Jan 2014 (MVGS 1420-2) was actually negative/ 
not detected for JCV DNA. 
Update 05 and 06 Mar 2014: Additional information was received from the neurologist via a MS Standardized PML 
Data Collection Tool. The patient was diagnosed with MS in 2000 and IRIS (onset unknown). The patient was on 
TYSABRI therapy from 11 Jun 2012 to 12 Sep 2013. The neurologist assessed the patient s estimated Karnofsky 
and EDSS scores on 11 Jun 2012 and on 22 May 2013 to be 80 (normal activity with effort; some signs or 
symptoms of disease) and 3.5. The physician assessed the patient's estimated Karnofsky and EDSS scores on 17 
Oct 2013 to be 70 (cares for self; unable to carry on normal activity or to do active work) and 3.5. The patient has 
not been tested for serum anti-JCV antibodies. The patient tested positive for anti-natalizumab antibodies on 11 
Jun 2006 and was negative for HIV on unknown date. The patient underwent a lumbar puncture on 17 Oct 2013 
with results reported as negative ((b) (6) ) and positive for CSF JCV DNA at 13 copies per mL ((b) (6) ). A brain biopsy 
has not been done. The patient underwent a lumbar puncture on 14 Jan 2014 with results reported as negative.  An
MRI was performed on May 2013 prior to PML diagnosis which indicated multiple demyelinating lesions, unchanged
in number and size, without any pathological enhancement. MRI performed on 14 Oct 2013 (at the time of PML 
diagnosis) showed the presence of several foci, sometimes confluent, with high signal in T2, located in the cerebral 
hemispheric white matter, mainly distributed in the periventricular area and in the brainstem, especially at the pons 
level. Sulci, ventricles, and cisterns showed an extension of atrophic type. After contrast medium administration,

images referable to active demyelinating lesions were not observed. Compared to the previous MRI performed on 
22 May 2012 in a different site, a T2 hyperintense lesion was found in the cortico-subcortical junction, in the left 
rolandic area, free from any modification after medium contrast administration. The lesion may not have a 
demyelinating nature and should be evaluated in relation to the clinical picture. Cervical and dorsal rachys MRI 
showed the presence of T2 hyperintense lesions in the medullary parenchima, of possible demylinating nature, 
located behind the vertebrae C3, sometimes in the C4-C5 inter-vertebral space and D11. After contrast medium 
administration, images referable to active demyelinating lesions were not observed. In comparison with the 
previous MRI performed on 22 May 2013, no changes were found. The patient has not received prior 
immunosuppressant therapy. Prior immunomodulatory therapy included Rebif (interferon beta-1a)(previously 
reported). The patient underwent a total of two PLEX exchange sessions on 23 Oct 2013 and on 25 Oct 2013. PML
treatment included corticosteroids 8 g IV daily from 09 Dec 2013 to 14 Feb 2014.  No known treatment for IRIS. 
The patient is alive, residing at home. The patient has not recovered from PML. The outcome is unknown for IRIS. 
Causality for the event PML was assessed as related to TYSABRI. Causality was assessed as unknown for IRIS.
Update 19 Mar 2014: Additional information was received from the neurologist, noting that an anti-natalizumab 
antibodies test was not performed on 11 Jun 2006 as previously reported and that the patient tested positive for 
serum anti-JCV antibody status on 11 Jun 2012.
Update 23 Sep 2014: Additional information was received from a physician via a MS Standardized PML Data 
Collection Tool. The patient is alive, residing at home, and is not currently on any MS therapy. The physician 
assessed the patient s estimated Karnofsky and EDSS scores on 18 Jul 2014 to be 60 (requires occasional 
assistance, but is able to care for most of her personal needs) and 3.5. A brain MRI was performed on 07 May 
2014 (results not provided). Clinical symptoms for IRIS included paresis of the right hand and slight paresis of the 
right leg (multifocal motor) on 30 Dec 2013, and clonic movements of the right hand (focal seizure) on 14 Jan 2014.
Methylprednisolone 1 GM IV was administered on 30 Dec and 31 Dec 2013, and on 14 Jan and 15 Jan 2014 as 
treatment for IRIS. As of 18 Jul 2014, the patient has not recovered from PML and has not recovered from IRIS. 
Causality for the events was assessed as related to TYSABRI.
Update 19 Feb 2015: Additional information was received from a physician via a MS Standardized PML Data 
Collection Tool. The patient is alive, residing at home, and is not currently on any MS therapy. The physician 
assessed the patient s estimated Karnofsky and EDSS scores on 20 Nov 2014 to be 60 (requires occasional 
assistance, but is able to care for most of her personal needs) and 3.5. A brain MRI was performed on 04 Nov 2014
(results not provided). As of 20 Nov 2014, the patient has not recovered form PML and has recovered from IRIS. 
Causality for the events of PML and IRIS was assessed as related to TYSABRI.

Natalizumab related PML:  Atypical neuroradiological findings.  Presented at the 27th Annual Meeting of the 
European Congress of Radiology (ECR); Vienna Austria.  03 Mar 2015.  Eighteen patients with suspected PML 
lesions were sampled.  Three radiologic patters were defined:  anergic, mainly white matter non-enhancing lesions, 
inflammatory white matter lesions with punctate or curvilinear enhancement and atypical.  Lesions prevail in the left 
frontal lobe.  Focal lesions involved the subcortical WM in 16 patients, the deep WM in 10 and the grey matter 8 
cases. PML lesions were hypointense on T1w and hyperintense on DWI in 14 pts. All patients have hyperintense 
lesions on T2w images. Focal lesions enhanced in 5 cases. At the beginning of the disease pattern A was observed
in 3 patients and pattern B in 3 cases. The "atypical pattern" with cortical involvement was detected in 9 patients 
and with "milky way sign" in 5.
Update 02 Nov 2015: Additional information was received from the neurologist via a MS Standardized PML Data 
Collection Tool.  The patient is alive, living at home and not on therapy for Multiple Sclerosis.  The most recent MRI 
was performed on 10 Sep 2015 with stable results. The patient's Karnofsky and EDSS scores were assessed on 18
Sep 2015 to be 70 (cares for self; unable to carry on normal activity or to do work), 100 (normal no complaints; no 
evidence of disease), and 3.0. On 20 Nov 2014, the patient was assessed as recovered with sequelae from the 
event of PML (discrepant from previous report). The patient was assessed on 18 Sep 2015 to be recovered with 
sequelae from the event of IRIS. The causality of the events of PML and IRIS has been assessed as related to the 
suspect product.
