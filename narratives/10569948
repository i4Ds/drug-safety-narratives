Update 29 Oct 2014:
Follow-up information received from the neurologist reported the patient is switching from TYSABRI to fingolimod. 
The test (presume JCV DNA PCR) was being performed to ensure there is no active JCV infection.  The result was
positive at <50 viral copies. Clarification on result is being sought with (b) (6)  laboratories. The patient has no 
symptoms (apart from feeling tired with a chest infection at present). MRI scan early Aug [2014] was similar to scan
in Apr [2014], which does not look like PML.
Update 29 Oct 2014: Follow-up information received from the neurologist indicated an MRI performed the same 
day (29 Oct 2014) showed "typical changes" and the patient was noted to have PML.
Update 30 Oct 2014: The neurologist reported the patient phoned on Tues (presume 28 Oct 2014) asking about 
JCV results, but did not complain about any symptoms.  On Wed (presume 29 Oct 2014), the patient said they 
were experiencing symptoms which had evolved over last 2 weeks including speech, dexterity and clumsiness.
MRI scan performed Wed showed widespread multi-lobar PML like lesions including the cortical area and 
brainstem.  This represented significant changes from Aug [2014] scan (results not provided).  The patient is 
currently hospitalized and receiving antiviral medicines plus mirtazipine. They are considering adding mefloquine.
They will perform plasmapheresis to remove remaining TYSABRI.  The physician feels the MRI results, JCV DNA, 
and symptoms indicate PML.  The physician noted the speed and extent of spread in this case, the fact that 
symptoms are over the last few weeks only, MRI was clear in August, and that it was chance that it was detected.
Update 30 Oct 2014: Follow-up information received included (b) (6)  laboratory confirming that the results indicated 
that the number of copies of JCV DNA was < 50 copies/mL. The calculated quantity (34 copies/mL) was below the 
lower limit of quantitation (LLOQ) for the assay which was 50 copies/mL.
Update 10 Nov 2014: This case was received from the MHRA (agency reference number: 22752361-001).  No 
further information was provided.
Update 12 Nov 2014: Follow-up information received from the neurologist included a Suspect PML Data Collection 
Form.  MS was diagnosed in 2010, with presentation occurring in Feb 2010.  In Feb 2010 the patient experienced 
cerebellar symptoms (NOS).  In Jun 2010, the patient experienced weakness legs and numbness hands and feet.
TYSABRI therapy was started on 30 Aug 2011 and stopped on 25 Oct 2014.  Second test for anti-JCV antibody 
((b) (6) ), on 09 Oct 2013, was positive with index 3.859.  MRI prior to the suspected PML diagnosis was 
performed on 06 Aug 2014 (results not provided).
The signs and symptoms which led to the evaluation for possible PML included slurred speech, word finding 
difficulties, right arm ataxia, drowsy, and tired (onset (b) (6) ).  On (b) (6)  the patient underwent lumbar

puncture.  CSF JCV DNA testing by (b) (6)  laboratories showed 34 copies/ml (previously reported).  MRI at the time
of suspected PML diagnosis was performed on (b) (6)  (date discrepant).  The patient underwent five plasma 
exchange (PLEX) sessions on (b) (6) (b) (6) (b) (6) (b) (6)  and (b) (6)   PML 
treatment included mefloquine (250 mg, PO, weekly, started on(b) (6) ), cidofovir (5 mg/kg weekly for two 
weeks, then every other week, IV, started on (b) (6) ), mirtazapine (45 mg, daily, started on (b) (6) ), and 
Keppra (levetiracetam) (500 mg, PO, started on (b) (6) ).
Update 13 Nov 2014: Biogen Idec considers this case to be a confirmed case of PML based on positive CSF, 
radiologic evidence, MRI, and clinical symptoms.
Update 25 Nov 2014: This case was received from the MHRA (agency reference number: 22752361-002).  No 
further information was provided.
Update 12 Dec 2014: Follow-up information was received from the physician. The patient was further identified as 
male and was noted to be not very well. The patient was experiencing myoclonic jerks despite seizure prophylaxis.
Update 17 Dec 2014: A medical doctor spontaneously reported that the patient, further identified as a 34 year old 
adult patient on TYSABRI (unknown dose, unknown route, unknown frequency) for an unknown indication 
experienced suspect PML (onset unknown).  No history of immunosuppressant use was noted. The patient was 
relatively independent before PML was diagnosed but was now bed bound and in ITU [intensive treatment unit]. 
The patient was JCV positive by CSF analysis with a result of 34 copies per ml on an unspecified date (previously 
reported results from(b) (6) ).  Additionally, a CSF sample is to be sent (b) (6)  [(b) (6) ] at the latest 
for testing.  No treatment for the event was reported. The outcome for the event suspect PML is unknown. The 
causality for the event of suspect PML is unknown.  It is unknown if TYSABRI treatment is ongoing.

continue his recovery at home.
Update 08 May 2015: Follow-up information received from the neurologist reported the patient has been discharged
from the hospital (date not provided) and is scheduled for an office visit this month.
Update 29 May 2015: Follow-up information received from the neurologist reported the patient underwent scan 
[MRI] every 4 months after 2 years of therapy. The rationale was high Ab titer (JCV antibody titer) and over two 
years of [TYSABRI] treatment.
Update 10 Jun 2015: Follow-up information was received from the neurologist. The patient first presented with MS 
in Feb 2011 (previously reported as 2010) as a brain stem and motor relapse. MS disease symptoms prior to 
suspected PML included transverse myelitis (Jul 2010 to Jan 2011), ataxia and double vision (Feb 2010 to Jan 
2011), and sensory transverse myelitis (Jul 2010 to Apr 2011). The patient had 5 relapses for 18 months from Feb 
2010 to Apr 2011, MRI (date not provided) showed greater than 10 Gadolinium lesions. The patient had no 
previous immunosuppressant or immunomodulatory therapy. The patient was JCV antibody positive pre-TYSABRI 
in Sep/Oct 2011. JCV index in Apr 2014 was 3.859. EDSS pre-TYSABRI was 3.5 in Jul 2011, during TYSABRI was 
0.0, and at PML suspicion, in Oct 2014 was 3.5.  Follow-up EDSS on 18 May 2015 was 7.0. The patient started 
regular, every 4 weeks, TYSABRI infusions in Aug 2011 and stopped in (b) (6)  due to change to fingolimod.  
Leukocyte, lymphocyte, and absolute lymphocyte counts were repeatedly normal from 2011 to 2014; leukocyte 
subset analysis was not done. The patient had not experienced an interruption of the suspect product for greater 
than 3 months. MRI prior to suspected PML was performed in Aug 2014. In (b) (6)  the patient experienced onset
of symptoms described as first noticed word finding problems, hesitant speech followed by [illegible] right hand. 
Symptom intermittent first few weeks. Additional signs and symptoms in (b) (6)  which led to evaluation for 
possible PML included right sided weakness, dysphagia, blurring of the vision, double vision, unsteady gait, and 
poor coordination (right). The signs and symptoms prompted an MRI which revealed suspicious findings. 
Leukocyte, lymphocyte, and absolute lymphocyte counts were all normal; leukocyte subset analysis was not done. 
In (b) (6)  the patient had positive CSF at 34 copies/ml and MRI was performed on (b) (6)  which confirmed 
PML. The patient had monthly MRIs in Feb 2014 and weekly MRIs in(b) (6)  MRI (date not specified) showed 
worsening PML. The last MRI on 14 May (presume 2015) showed some regression of PML changes and worsening
global atrophy. Additional MRI details reported were multilobar involvement, frontal, parietal left, occipital, thalamus 
left and brain stem left. The patient was tested for JCV due to change to fingolimod. The test was performed in (b)(6)  
(b) (6)  and was positive for JC at 34 copies/ml; second test (b) (6)  showed >600 copies/ml (presume CSF JCV 
DNA). Brain biopsy was not performed. The patient received treatment with plasma exchange (PLEX), five 
sessions on(b)  (b , (b , (b) (b) (6)(6) ) ) (6)   The patient was also treated with cidofovir, mirtazapine, mefloquine, GCSF 
(granulocyte-colony stimulating factor; 2 courses, 1 week each), maraviroc, and antiepileptic.  The patient also 
received corticosteroids (MP - presume methylprednisolone) for IRIS. The patient was in the ITU (intensive

treatment unit) for 12 weeks with refractory status epilepticus (onset (b) (6) ). The final diagnosis was considered
PML. The patient is alive and his current location was at home. 
Update 16 Jun 2015: Follow-up information reported by the neurologist indicated that the male patient on TYSABRI 
experienced PML, with resulting EDSS change from 0 to 7.5.
Update 19 Jun 2015: Follow-up information received from the neurologist reported that the patient was diagnosed 
[with PML] in (b) (6)  was inpatient until (b) (6)  and has been at home since.
Update 26 Jun 2015: Follow-up information was received from the physician who indicated that the patient is slowly 
recovering, his speech, movement and limb strength are improving. The physician estimates that the patient 
currently has an EDSS score of approximately 6.
Update 26 Nov 2015: Additional information was received from the neurologist via a month 12 MS Standardized 
PML Data Collection Tool. The patient was alive, residing at home, and not currently on MS therapy. The patient 
was on TYSABRI for 3.5 years between 2011 and 2014 (previously reported). The patient's EDSS pre-TYSABRI 
was assessed to be 3.5.  The patient's EDSS score assessed at the end of (b) (6)  to (b) (6)  was 6.5. The 
patient's most recent MRI was performed in Sep 2015 with the following results: multilobar, including brain stem, 
PML; improving; and severe global brain atrophy. The neurologist assessed the patient s estimated Karnofsky and 
EDSS scores in Oct 2015 (12 months from the time of diagnosis) to be 50 (requires considerable assistance and 
frequent medical care) and 0.0. The event of IRIS was treated with Maraviroc (unknown dosing information). The 
patient has recovered with sequelae (severe) from PML (EDSS 6.5; mild visual agnosia and right hemiparesis). The
patient has recovered from IRIS (mild MRI, mainly end of (b) (6)  to (b) (6) ). Causality for the events of PML 
and IRIS was assessed as related to TYSABRI.
