AER 1473543, is an interventional study literature summary case, received on 13/Oct/2014 from a physician and 
concerns a group of patients some of whom developed progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, 
thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, fever without neutropenia, infection without neutropenia, fatigue, hypertension, 
insomnia, hearing loss, generalised weakness, syncope, larynx pain, rash, ventricular arrhythmia, neuropathic pain,
dyspnea, cytokine release syndrome, back pain, chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, acute non-lymphocytic leukaemia, 
and non-haematopoietic malignancies (unk diagnosis) while being enrolled in study ML01374: a randomized clinical
trial designed to compare maintenance rituximab against re-treatment rituximab in low-tumor burden follicular 
lymphoma.
Between 21/Nov/2003, and 12/Sep/2008, 545 patients with indolent non-Hodgkin lymphoma were enrolled in trial.
Pathology review was required per protocol, and tissue was submitted in 507 patient cases. Review of local 
pathology reports was used in the remaining 38 patient cases.  Follicular histology was noted in 408 patients (75%) 
and nonfollicular histology in 131 patients; for six patients, the correct histology could not be determined.  Of the 
408 patients with low-tumor burden follicular lymphoma, 289 responded to induction rituximab and were randomly 
assigned to re-treatment rituximab (n-143) or maintenance rituximab (n-146).  All patients received single-agent 
rituximab at a dose of 375 mg/m2 administered once per week for four doses (i.e., induction rituximab), with 
restaging at week 13.  Response was assessed using the standard lymphoma response criteria applicable in 2004.

Patients with stable or progressive disease (PD) at week 13 were taken off study.  Patients demonstrating partial 
(PR) or complete response (CR) at week 13 were randomly assigned to either RR or MR, stratified by histology 
(follicular lymphoma vs other), age (60 years vs other) and time from diagnosis.  Patients randomly assigned to RR 
were observed, without any additional treatment until PD.  At PD, patients receiving RR were re-treated with four 
doses at 375 mg/m2, once per week, of rituximab, which were repeated at each PD, until the development of 
treatment failure.  Patients randomly assigned to MR received a single dose of rituximab 375 mg/m2 every 13 
weeks until treatment failure.  The dosing interval was based on the known rituximab pharmacokinetics at the time 
of protocol design.  Randomly assigned patients were evaluated every 13 weeks with repeat CT scan imaging 
every 26 weeks.
In re-treatment rituximab group toxicities were grade 3 thrombocytopenia (1 patient), grade 4 neutropenia (2), grade
3 fatigue (1), grade 3 hypertension (1), grade 3 syncope (1).  In maintenance rituximab group toxicities were grade 
3 fever without neutropenia (1), grade 3 infection without neutropenia (1), grade 3 fatigue(3), grade 3 hypertension 
(1), grade 3 insomnia (1), grade 3 hearing loss (1), grade 3 generalized weakness (1) and grade 3 larynx pain (1), 
grade 3 rash, grade 3 ventricular arrhythmia, grade 3 neuropathic pain, grade 3 dyspnea, grade 3 cytokine release 
syndrome (2 events), grade 4 back pain, chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, acute non-lymphocytic leukaemia, and 
non-haematopoietic malignancies (unk diagnosis). One patient developed progressive multifocal 
leukoencephalopathy (PML) after maintenance rituximab dose 15 and died.
There was insufficient information regarding outcome of thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, fever without neutropenia, 
infection without neutropenia, fatigue, hypertension, insomnia, hearing loss, generalised weakness, syncope, larynx
pain, rash, ventricular arrhythmia, neuropathic pain, dyspnea, cytokine release syndrome, back pain, chronic 
lymphocytic leukaemia, acute non-lymphocytic leukaemia, and non-haematopoietic malignancies (unk diagnosis) 
therapy ongoing status of rituximab.
The authors reported progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, fever without 
neutropenia, infection without neutropenia, fatigue, hypertension, insomnia, hearing loss, generalised weakness, 
syncope, larynx pain, rash, ventricular arrhythmia, neuropathic pain, dyspnea, cytokine release syndrome, back 
pain, chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, acute non-lymphocytic leukaemia, and non-haematopoietic malignancies (unk
diagnosis) as toxicities of rituximab.
The company assessed the events of thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, fever without neutropenia, infection without 
neutropenia, fatigue, hypertension, insomnia, hearing loss, generalised weakness, syncope, larynx pain, rash, 
ventricular arrhythmia, neuropathic pain, dyspnea, cytokine release syndrome, back pain, chronic lymphocytic 
leukaemia, acute non-lymphocytic leukaemia, and non-haematopoietic malignancies (unk diagnosis) as medically 
significant.

The following information originally received on 13/Oct/2014 was corrected using the latest received date of the 
previous report (13/Oct/2014) : progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy was added as event with outcome, 
causality and expectedness.
Additional information was received on 26/Jan/2015. The following information was added to the case: New 
reporter was added, new literature reference added.
Additional information was received on 21/Mar/2016 and the following information was added in to the case.
New reporter added. New events rash, ventricular arrhythmia, neuropathic pain, dyspnea, cytokine release 
syndrome, back pain, chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, acute non-lymphocytic leukaemia, and non-haematopoietic 
malignancies(unk diagnosis) were added. The reporter causality and company causality statement updated. New 
literature reference added.
This case is cross referenced with logically deleted AER 1474419 (same literature article) and logically deleted AER
1526170 (same study).
AER 1526170 was identified as a duplicate of AER 1473543. All information from AER 1526170 (logically deleted) 
was added to AER 1473543, which remains the active case.
