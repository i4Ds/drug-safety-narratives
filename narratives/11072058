No information given on patient's history, past drugs and concurrent conditions.
The patient received the following CONCOMITANT MEDICATION: Acetaminophen (paracetamol), Atenolol 
(atenolol), Cetirizine Hydrochloride (cetirizine hydrochloride), Diphenhydramine Hydrochloride (diphenhydramine 
hydrochloride), Duloxetine Hydrochloride (duloxetine hydrochloride), Medrol (methylprednisolone 
[methylprednisolone]), Methylprednisolone (methylprednisolone [methylprednisolone]), Prevacid (lansoprazole), 
Vitamin E (tocopherol [tocopherol]), and Zopiclone (zopiclone).
On an unspecified date the patient started ASPIRIN (acetylsalicylic acid) for unknown indication, frequency or

The concomitant medications in this case are: Cetirizine Hydrochloride, Diphenhydramine Hydrochloride, 
Duloxetine Hydrochloride, Medrol (methylprednisolone), Prevacid (lansoprazole), and Zopiclone.
Considering the pathophysiology of MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS, POST-TRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER,
INTERVERTEBRAL DISCITIS, NEUROPATHY PERIPHERAL, RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS, and the drug safety 
profile, Company deems these events as unrelated, citing them as concurrent disorders, despite the not reported 
temporal relationship.
