PROT COL NUMBER: 
UTC-035209 is a report from a study site 111111located in the United States participating in the United Therapeutics 
Corporation (UTC) Study DIV-NB-201, also known as National Cancer Institute (NCI) Study 9347, conducted under 
Investigational New Drug Application (IND) number 110,494. This study is a 6-course, multicenter, randomized, 
open-label, 2-sequence, cross-over study for eligible subjects with high-risk neuroblastoma to assess the 
pharmacokinetic comparability of ch14.18 manufactured with LJTC drug product (ch14.18-UTC) and ch14.18 
manufactured with NCI drug product (ch14.18-NCI). Subjects were randomly allocated to receive ch14.18-UTC or 
ch14.18-NCI during courses 1 and 2; subjects received 014.18 manufactured by other manufacturer (ch14.18-NCI 
or ch14.18-UTC, respectively) during Courses 3, 4, and 5. The interval between ch14.18 doses was 28 days. 
Subjects were scheduled to receive, in addition to ch14.18, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-
CS) in Courses 1, 3, and 5, interleukin-2 (IL-2) in Courses 2 and 4, and isotretinoin (ISOT) in all 6 courses. 
The serious adverse event term of "abdominal pain " (Abdominal pian) was reported for Subject 002. This subject 
was a 5-year old, 17.4kg (28.6-1b), Caucasian/Hispanic female of unreportable height.

metastases. Relevant medical history included recurrent oral Candida, Enterococcus urinary tract infection, fever, 
and pancytopenia. The subject was allergic to cephalosprorins with reaction of swelling in face and vancomycin with 
reaction of red man syndrome. The subject was on the following concomitant medications at the time of the event; 
Vistaril (hydroxyzine), Miralax (macrogol), Neurontin (gabapentin), Pentamidine, and Zofran (ondansetron). 
During course 1, GM-CSF was started on an unreported study Day and stopped on an unreported study Day.2 
During Course 2, on study Day 48 (04 Jun 2013), approximately 17 days after initiating ch14.18-NCI (17 Jun 2013) 
and approximately 14 days after stopping ch14.18-NCi (20 Jun 2013), the subject experienced a serious adverse 
event of "abdominal pain" described as burning with one episode of vomiting, some nausea, and diarrhea. The 
subject had taken a number of medications for the nausea, and pain, which did not control them. 
During Course 2, IL-2 was started on study Day 31 (17 Jun 2013) and stopped on study Day 34 (20 Jun 2013) and 
ISOT was started on study Day 38 (24 Jun 2013). 
The reason the serious adverse event of abdominal pain was considered serious was due to the subject requiring 
hospitalization. On the subject was hospitalized for observation for severe abdominal pain, nausea, 
and vomiting. On 11111111111=1 the suject presented to the emergency room (ER) with severe abdominal pain, 
nausea, and vomiting. Laboratory test results collected the day prior (.1=11110 were as follows: a lipase of 172 
U/L (reference range (RR) 25 to 120 U/LI , an alanine aminotraneferase (SGPT) of 92 U/L (RR 33 to 52) and an 
aspartate aminctransferaae (SGOTI of 90 U/L (20 t o 45). Urine anaylsis was clear. The treatment In the ER 
includod intravenous (IV) fluids and unspecified pain medications. The ER physician felt that the events could be 
managed at home but due to the late hours and uncertain outcome of how the patient would do at home, the 
subject was hospitalized. During hospitalization, the subject remained afebrile with negative cultures. The subject 
had no further episodes of nausea, vomiting or abdominal pain. She tolerated oral intake challenge. Blood lipase 
returned to normal at 37 UIL. The time difference between the abnormal lipase value and the repeat normal value 
was approximately 
16 hours. The investigator felt that the abnormal value may not be clinically significant due to the uick resolution of 
the test and the subjects symptoms. The subject was discharged from the hospital on 
The severity of the abdominal pain was considered to be severe. This event was reported to have met criteria for 
Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) severity grade 3. 
The action taken with the dose of ch14.18-NCI dose was not applicable to the event. 
The action take with the dose of other components of immunotherapy GM-CSF, IL-2 and ISOT was not applicable

due to the event. The outcome of abdominal pain was recovered on 06 Jul 2013. 
The investigator assessed the causal relationship between ch14.18-UTC and abdominal pain as not related. 
In the investigator assessed the causal relationship between ISOT and the abdominal pain as possible related and 
the causual relationship between GM-CSF, 1L-2 and and abdominal pain as not related. 
Other possible etiological factors were not provided by the investigator. 
UTC COMPANY COMMENTS: The investigator has assessed the serious adverse event of abdominal pain as not 
related to ch14.18-UTC, and the company agrees with this assessment. The temporal relationship of 17 days 
between the initiation of ch14.18-UTC treatment and the onset of the event and 14 days between the end of 
ch14.18-UTC treatment and the onset of the event makes the causal relationship between ch14.18-UTC and the 
event unlikely.
