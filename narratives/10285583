Medically Significant
A registered nurse reported that a patient on TYSABRI (300 mg, IV, QM) for Multiple Sclerosis approximately from 
24 Jun 2013 to unknown date and enrolled in a Biogen Idec sponsored marketing program of Monitored Therapy 
experienced possible PML (onset (b) (6) ). The high suspicion of PML was identified on MRI on(b) (6)
Lumbar puncture was done on(b) (6)  and CSF samples were sent to (b) (6)  and (b) (6)  Treatment for the 
event was not reported. The outcome for the event possible PML is unknown. The causality for the event of 
possible PML is unknown.  It is unknown if TYSABRI treatment is ongoing.
Update 02 Jul 2014: Additional information was received via Biogen Idec employee (Medical Science Liaison). The 
53 year old male patient on TYSABRI from 10 Dec 2010 had no prior history of immunosuppression. At the time of 
this report, the patient had a total 46 doses of TYSARI infusion from 10 Dec 2010 to  to 04 Jun 2014. His CSF was

tested positive for JCV DNA at (b) (6)  however there was a significant amount of blood in the sample. Serum JCV 
antibodies were tested positive on 25 May 2011, positive (index value 0.69) on 20 Nov 2013 and positive (index 
value 2.42) on 07 May 2014. No additional information was provided.
Update 02 Jul 2014: Additional information was received from the investigator confirming that the patient was 
enrolling in the (b) (6)  The patient on TYSABRI from 17 Dec 2010 to 04 
Jun 2014 was hospitalized from (b) (6)  for PML (onset(b) (6) ). The patient was currently in the hospital
at the time of this report for observation and further investigation. The investigator considered this event serious 
due to being life-threatening and medically significant as well. An MRI on (b) (6)  showed multiple lobar 
lesions consistent with PML. An MRI on (b) (6)  was consistent with PML. A lumbar puncture done on (b) (6)  
(b) (6)  showed 452065 copies/mL of JC virus DNA. The patient underwent plasma exchange from (b) (6)  to (b)(6)
(b) (6)  The event PML is ongoing. The causality for the event was assessed as related as "PML is a known 
infection associated with exposure to TYSABRI". TYSABRI was permanently discontinued (b) (6)
Update 08 Jul 2014: A lab report from (b) (6)  was received showing that there were 452065 copies/mL of JC Virus 
DNA in CSF samples. No further information was reported.
Update 10 Jul 2014: Additional information was received via Biogen Idec employee (Medical Science Liaison). The 
patient had MRIs done in 03 Jun 2013, 16 Dec 2013, (b) (6)  (previously reported), (b) (6)  (previously 
reported) and 04 Jul 2014 but the results were not reported. The patient had plasma exchange from (b) (6)
(discrepant date) to (b) (6)
Update 15 Jul 2014: The investigator considered the event PML serious due to persistent and significant disability 
in addition.
Update 23 Jul 2014: Follow-up recieved included MRI report information.  On 04 Jun 2013, MRI revealed no 
interval change compared to prior MRI, no evidence of PML.  On 16 Dec 2013, MRI revealed stable appearance of 
multiple T2 hyper intensities consistent with MS. There was a single new FLAIR hyper intensity in the right frontal 
white matter, no evidence of PML.  On (b) (6)  MRI revealed multiple lobar lesions consistent with PML, 
compared to 16 Dec 2013 there was diffuse white matter T2 hyerpintnesity within the anterior right frontal lobe 
involving subcortical U fibers, which was confluent and extended  to the frontal operculem and across the corpus 
callosum to the left frontal lobe centrum semivolae. On(b) (6)  MRI again noted diffuse white matter T2/ 
FLAIR hyper intensity predominantly in right frontal lobe involving subcortical U fibers. This extended from frontal 
operculum across corpus callosum to left frontal lobe centrum semiovale. No abnormal enhancement related to any
of the lesions or with respect to the extensive confluent white matter abnormality in right frontal lobe.  On 04 Jul 
2014, MRI revealed right frontal lobe PML lesion is stable.  A second abnormality extending to brain stem may

represent Wallerian degeneration or a second focus of PML. This abnormality has shown slight interim progression 
and is not typical of an MS lesion.  On 10 Jul 2014, MRI revealed stable appearing PML within both frontal lobe and 
unchanged white matter plaques. No evidence of new abnormality or findings to suggest IRIS.
Update 29 Aug 2014: Biogen Idec considers this case to be confirmed for PML based on the positive CSF and MRI 
finding.
Update 02 Sep 2014: The prescriber reported that the patient on TYSABRI since Dec 2010 with the last infusion in 
Jun [2014] was discontinued due to his MRI showing new lesions.  The patient had been positive for JCV for awhile.
 The patient was admitted to the hospital with "complications."  The patient died on (b) (6)  following 
complications due to PML.
Update 05 Sep 2014: Additional information received corrected the date of death to (b) (6)
Update 07 Oct 2014: Follow-up information was received from the study coordinator.  The patient tested postive for 
anti-JCV antibodies, index 2.42, on 07 May 2014.  It was noted that the patient had been JCV positive since starting
medication and there was no change in JCV status.  JCV DNA PCR on 24 Jun 2014 showed 452,065 copies/ml 
((b) (6)  laboratories) and 200,475 copies/ml ((b) (6) ).
Update 09 Jan 2015: Additional information was received from the Investigator via a Standardized PML Data 
Collection Tool. Karnofsky and EDSS scores were reported as follows: EDSS 4.0 on 15 Nov 2010; Karnofsky 70 
(cares for self; unable to carry on normal activity or to do active work) on 01 Dec 2010; Karnofsky 80 (normal 
activity with effort; some signs or symptoms of disease) on 31 Aug 2011; EDSS 4.0 on 05 Feb 2014; Karnofsky 50 
(requires considerable assistance and frequent medical care) and EDSS 6.0 on (b) (6)  The patient was 
diagnosed with IRIS, which was determined by clinical symptoms and MRI findings. Clinical symptoms included 
loss of memory, apathy and drowsiness (cognitive/behavioral) and increasing left sided weakness (focal motor) with
an onset date of 18 Aug 2014. The patient did not receive corticosteroids pre-IRIS onset. Treatment for IRIS 
included methylprednisolone 1000 mg IV daily from 23 Aug 2014 to 27 Aug 2014; maraviroc 150 mg PO BID from 
28 Jun 2014 to 27 Aug 2014; and PLEX IV daily from 27 Jun to 31 Jul 2014. The patient had not recovered from 
PML and had not recovered from IRIS. Causality for both events was assessed as related to TYSABRI.
Update 15 Jun 2015: A report was received from literature via an abstract presented at the 50th Annual Congress 
of the Canadian Neurological Sciences Federation (CNSF), Toronto, ON; Canada: Parks, NE, Bhan, V. 
Natalizumab-associated progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy occurring at low positive anti-JC virus antibody
level.  08 Jun 2015. The authors described a case of natalizumab-associated PML with low positive anti-JC virus 
index value prior to diagnosis. The 53 year old man with 20 year history of relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis was

diagnosed with PML following 46 infusions of natalizumab. Glatiramer acetate was his only prior immunomodulatory
therapy. Routine MRI surveillance resulted in diagnosis of PML following detection of a confluent right anterior 
frontal T2 hyperintense lesion extending across the corpus callosum (presume previously reported MRI results from
(b)  and (b) (6)(6) ). Six months prior (presume previously reported MRI on 16 Dec 2013), routine MRI 
surveillance demonstrated a small right frontal T2 hyperintensity with no diffusion restriction while serum anti-JC 
virus antibody index was 0.69 (previously reported test date 20 Nov 2013). The authors concluded that 
natalizumab-associated PML may develop despite low positive anti-JC virus index value.
