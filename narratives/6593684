This post-marketing special surveillance case (H3E-JE-AK01, PMS Non-Interventional) concerns a 65-year-old 
male. The patient was concurrently suffering from hypertension and lumbago. He had no history of allergy, 
interstitial lung disease, pulmonary fibrosis and asbestosis. He had a history of smoking (30 cigarettes per day for 
45 years) and asbestos exposure. He had never received chemotherapy, surgery or radiotherapy. He received 
thoracic cavity drainage (fromalnillatoMMIND). He was diagnosed with malignant pleural 
mesothelioma (histological diagnosis: epithelial type, stage IV) with metastases to the distant lymph nodes and 
pleural effusion. Prior to pemetrexed disodium (Alimta) therapy, auscultatory findins did not reveal any 
abnormality, his Sp02 was 96%, and serum creatinine was 0.77 mg/dL on q . His baseline performance 
status (PS) was one on111111111. Serum sodium (Na) was 135 mEq/L on...M. His concomitant 
medications were multiple included folic acid and vitamin B12. The patient received intravenous (IV) pemetrexed 
a83ll0k m g in combination with IV cisplatin '120 mg for malignant pleural mesothelioma on 18-Dec-2007. On- he developed nausea (reported as non-serious). On , he developed constipation (reported as 
non-serious) and anorexia (reported as non-serious). On ays after the first dose, serum 
creatinine increased (reported as non-serious), and serum sodium decreased (Na:126 mEq/L) which prolonged 
hospitalization. On 1111111111M, serum calcium (Ca) decreased (Ca:7.8 mg/dL) which prolonged hospitalization. 
On , he developed pleural effusion and dyspnoea which rolonged hospitalization. He received 
thoracic cavity drainage fromallallapoilINIM O dyspnoea was recovered. On OM 
111111111he received streptococcus pyogenes for pleural effusion. n the same day, he had pyrexia (reported as non- 
serious) and diarrhoea (reported as non-serious). On e was recovered from pleural effusion. He 
received calcium chloride anhydrous/ potassium chloride/ sodium chloride/ sodium lactate/ sorbitol from 16-Jan-
2008 to 21-Jan-2008. On. he developed serum magnesium (Mg) decreased (Mg: 1.2 mg/dL) and 
convulsion which prolonged hospitalization. He received calcium chlorate from 17-Jan-2008 to 20-Jan-2008 for 
calcium decreased. On he was recovered from serum magnesium decreased (Mg: 2.1 mg/dL). On 
he was recovered from serum sodium decreased (Na: 136 mEq/L). On the same day, he was 
recovering from serum calcium decreased (Ca: 8.6 mg/dL). Study drugs were discontinued. Attempted to obtain 
lot/control number; information was unknown. The investigator considered pleural effusion and dyspnoea were 
unrelated to the study drugs. And other events (convulsion, serum sodium decreased, serum calcium decreased 
and serum magnesium decreased) were related to the study drugs. No further information is expected. Closed the 
case. Updated on 17-Jun-2008 : Non-significant edit-Lab updated -entered into case. Updated on 21-Aug-2008: 
additional information was received on 19-Aug-2008. Added lab data. Changed patient demographics. Deleted 
'serum creatinine increased'. Updated narrative, PSUR and relevant field. Updated n 20-Nov-2008, Updated 
narrative. There was no medically significant information to impact database. Update 30-Nov-2009: Upon review, 
this case is being resubmitted due to a correction in the medical history E2B mapping.
