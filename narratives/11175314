Case number PHHY2015ES064759, is a literature report (previously reported as a spontaneous report) initially 
received on 28 May 2015, 01 Jun 2015, 03 Jun 2015, 04 Jun 2015 and 05 Jun 2015 (combined report) from a 
physician (author). The authors discussed about disease-modifying therapies and infectious risks in multiple 
sclerosis. This report refers to a 54-year-old male patient.
The patient's medical history included dyslipidemia treated with pitavastatin. The patient had his first MS (multiple 
sclerosis) symptoms in 1999. The patient was diagnosed with relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) in 2001
and started treatment with Betaferon (interferon beta 1b). At that time MRI was compatible with multiple sclerosis 
with lesions at C3 and C4, altered brainstem auditory evoked potentials and positive oligoclonal bands. No relapse 
was reported while on Betaferon.
On 16 Oct 2003, immunoglobulin G (IgG) was 744 mg/dl (normal range: 800 to 1800) and immunoglobulin M (IgM) 
was 62 mg /dl (normal range: 65 to 265). On 12 Apr 2004, IgG 668 was mg/dl and was IgM 64 mg/dl. On 27 Apr 
2005, IgG was 742 mg/dl and IgM was 61 mg/dl. On 11 Oct 2006, IgG was 667 mg/dl and IgM was 63 mg/dl. On 07
Nov 2007, IgG was 793 mg/dl and IgM was 62 mg/dl.
On 01 Jul 2008, the patient's absolute lymphocyte count was 1.4 x10E3/mm3 (normal: 1.00 to 4.80). MRIs in 13 
Jun 2006 and Jan 2009 showed demyelinating lesions compatible with MS. The patient was hospitalized in (b) (6) 
(b) (6)  due to clinical worsening and urinary sepsis that was treated with a bolus of methylprednisolone (1 gm IV for 5

days) and antibiotics IV. The patient showed physical recovery and significant improvement in the walking 
capability. On 16 Jun 2009, brain and spinal MRI showed no changes at brain level. On 18 Jun 2009, the patient's 
absolute lymphocyte count was 0.92 x10E3/mm3. On 26 Sep 2009, No changes were noticed from MRI performed 
on Jun 2009. On 17 Aug 2010, the patient's absolute lymphocyte count was 1.62 x10E3/mm3.
The patient was diagnosed with inflammatory bowel disease (ulcerative colitis) in Jan 2011. Treated with oral 
Claversal (mesalazine or 5 aminosalicylic acid) at a dose of 500 mg/12h from Apr 2011. The patient had never 
received any other immunosuppressive treatment for the ulcerative colitis, neither local nor systemic 
corticosteroids.
On 23 Feb 2011, the absolute lymphocyte count was 0.83 x10E3/mm3. No medical history of HIV, malignancy, 
transplant or any other immunosuppressive conditions or medication. No history of prior Tysabri use. The patient 
developed some kind of needle phobia with Betaferon and an increase of EDSS (expanded disability status scale) 
not related to relapses. In Jan 2012, EDSS was 4.5 and treated with methylprednisolone (1 gm IV for 5 days) 
without clinical improvement. EDSS was 2 in Feb 2012 and 4 in Sep 2012.
On 28 Feb 2012, the patient's absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) was 1.08 x10E3/mm3. On 27 Aug 2012, T 
lymphocytes (total CD3) were 63.53 percent (normal: 50.00 to 90.00 percent). T Lymphocytes (total CD3) 477 cells 
/mm3 (Normal: 1000 to 4000). T Helper CD3/CD4 was 377 cells /mm3 (normal: 400 to 1200), 50.27 percent 
(normal: 30 to 60). T suppressor CD3/CD8 was 89 cells /mm3 (100 to 600) (11.89 percent) (low), CD4/CD8 ratio 
4.22 (high) and LB (CD19) 19.4 percent (normal). Mantoux test performed on Aug 2012: negative. Serology tests in
Aug 2012 were negative for lgG, rubella, toxoplasma, Epstein Barr virus, herpes simplex 1 and 2, varicella.
On 27 Sep 2012, brain and spinal MRI showed at least 30 flair lesions, most of them supratentorial, three of them in
medulla oblongata. In general, lesions were small, except one in right occipital confluence. On 09 Oct 2012, Anti JC
virus antibody levels were positive. This test was done to evaluate the safer switch from IFN beta 1b to any of the 
second lines treatment: natalizumab or fingolimod.
The patient was switched from Betaferon to Gilenya (fingolimod) on 09 Nov 2012 for the treatment of multiple 
sclerosis, due to tolerability problems mentioned above with Betaferon.
During Gilenya treatment the patient did not have any relapses and his EDSS were stable around 4.00. On 10 Dec 
2012, the patient's lymphocyte count was 0.43 x10E3/mm3 (lymphocyte count decreased). On 28 Jan 2013, the 
patient's lymphocyte count was 0.36 x10E3/mm3. On 26 Feb 2013, the patient's lymphocyte count was 0.43 
x10E3/mm3. On 20 May 2013, the patient's lymphocyte count was 0.36 x10E3/mm3. On 28 Aug 2013, the patient's
lymphocyte count was 0.55 x10E3/mm3. On 04 Sep 2013, the patient's lymphocyte count was 0.52 x10E3/mm3.

On 25 Nov 2013, the patient's lymphocyte count was 0.48 x10E3/mm3.
The last colonoscopy was performed on 01 Feb 2014 and did not show any inflammatory activity. HIV test was 
negative. Total cholesterol 280 mg/dl (at that time he was already diagnosed with dyslipidemia). lgG and lgM were 
slightly below normal limits (lgG 687 mg/dl lgM 57 mg/dl). Multimodal evoked potentials (MEP) showed: vision MEP 
normal, auditory MEP altered, somatosensory MEP within the normal range, but with reduced voltage on left side. 
On 17 Feb 2014, the patient's lymphocyte count was 0.37 x10E3/mm3, absolute neutrophil was 1.67x10E3/mm3 
(Normal: 1.7 to 7 x10E3/mm3). Except this date, neutrophil counts were within normal range before and during 
entire Gilenya therapy duration. On 28 May 2014, the patient's lymphocyte count was 0.35 x10E3/mm3. On 08 Sep 
2014, the patient's lymphocyte count was 0.51 x10E3/mm3. Last EDSS was 4.5 in Jan 2015. On 19 Jan 2015, the 
patient's lymphocyte count was 0.46 x10E3/mm3. On 11 Mar 2015, the patient's lymphocyte count was 0.38 
x10E3/mm3.
A brain MRI was done in 14 Aug 2014 showed cerebral demyelinating lesions, malformation in the occipital cervical
charnel, and dorsal and cervical medullar spine without significant findings. This MRI was reviewed by external 
experts and in their opinion atypical non enhancing lesions were present in the right frontal and occipital region. Anti
INF (interferon) antibodies were requested due to important skin reaction, but came out negative. Concomitant 
medications Livazo (pitavastatin calcium) was started from 17 Mar 2015.
On 09 and 10 May 2015, the patient was very quiet and did not answer her wife questions (disturbance in attention).
On 11 to 12 May 2015, the weather was very hot and patient feel very exhausted (fatigue), since then he was very 
sleepy (somnolence) and without willing to do anything. Between 15 and 16 May 2015, patient was annoyed 
(irritability) with normal daily activities and presented more clumsiness. On (b) (6)  the patient went to the 
emergency room for worsening of his general condition in the last 3 weeks. The symptoms included walking 
instability/difficulties walking (gait disturbance), motor clumsiness (motor dysfunction) and cognitive symptoms 
inattention, somnolence, bradypsychia (bradyphrenia) (slowness of mental reactions), delayed answer to simple 
questions and delayed execution to simple orders (cognitive disorder) and apathy. The patient was hospitalized on 
the same day with suspicion of Progressive Multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML). Electroencephalogram (EEG) 
showed hemisphere asymmetry with slowness from the right hemisphere. Treatment with levetiracetam was started
due to EEG abnormality. Patient did not improve with treatment and has not worsened when treatment was 
stopped. Lymphocyte population has been restored, but possibly their normal functionality has not been recovered.
On 27 May 2015, the patient underwent brain MRI, suggestive of PML revealed large and coalescence hyper 
intense lesions in the white matter disease of both hemisphere (right predominance), with no mass effect and no 
gad enhancement. On the same day, leucocyte was 3000/mm3 (White blood cell count decreased) (normal: 4.5 to

11.1), lymphocyte was 0.33 x10E3/mm3. HIV test was negative twice on 27 and 29 May 2015. Gilenya was 
discontinued on 27 May 2015. From 27 May 2015, the patient was treated with Mirtazipine 60 mg on 1st day, 
followed by 30 mg/day, followed by maintenance dose with 15 mg/day and Mefloquin 250 mg/day for 3 consecutive 
days followed by 250 mg per week. On 28 May 2015, Lumber puncture was done and JCV DNA PCR (polymerase 
chain reaction) from CSF (cerebrospinal fluid) was positive (JC virus test positive) in local lab. Number of copies 
was unknown. PCR for EBV, CMV and Toxoplasma were negative. CSF examination revealed: Cells count: 0, 
glucose and protein levels: normal. Onconeuronal antibodies were negative. The patient has been receiving 
mesazaline during hospitalization.
On 29 May 2015, Lymphocyte was 0.20 x10E3/mm3 and leucocyte was 3000 /mm3. Subpopulations: Lymphocytes 
T (total CD3) 39.67 percent (normal: 50.00 to 90.00). Lymphocytes T (total CD3) 109.00 cells /mm3 (Normal: 1000 
4000). Lymphocytes T Helper (CD3/CD4) 25.26 percent (normal: 30.00 to 60.00). Lymphocytes T Helper 
(CD3/CD4) 70.00 cells/mm3 (normal: 400 to 1200). Lymphocytes T Supressor (CD3/CD8) 12.23 percent (normal: 
20.00 to 40.00). Lymphocytes T Supressor (CD3/CD8) 34.00 cells/mm3 (normal: 100 to 600). CD4/CD8 Ratio 2.07 
(normal: 0.50 to 2.50). Lymphocytes B (CD19) 9.80 percent. On the same day, IgG was 674 mg/dL (blood 
immunoglobulin G decreased), IgM was 36 mg/dL (blood immunoglobulin M decreased). Proteinogram was normal 
except decrease in Gamma protein 0.69 g/dL (normal range: 0.80 to 1.35). HIV antibodies 12 negative.
The patient's condition has been deteriorated over 30 and 31 May 2015. On 31 May 2015, clinical examination 
showed persistence of cognitive symptoms (inattention, slowness of mental reaction, apathy), inability to walk 
without assistant, and some stereotyped and continuous movements (stereotypy) with his left arm (flexion and 
extension at elbow and wrist levels). On 02 Jun 2015, the physician informed that patient's did not have significant 
change of his condition in comparison to 31 May 2015. On 03 Jun 2015, the patient underwent neurologic 
assessment which showed: EEG similar to previous. The patient was subjectively better and was in better mood but
without any change from the clinical assessment. The physical examination showed residual hemiparesis 
(hemiparesis) that allows him to walk an autonomous way with spastic components. The patient collaborated 
partially in the clinical assessment due to a lack of interest. The patient was inattentive, avoided eye contact and 
tended to look to the right (more possible due to a left visual negligence than due to hemianopsia, although it could 
be present as well). He answered some questions but not all, with coherent but poor language. The patient 
presented some movements apparently without an objective, stereotyped with arms and legs, occupational or 
choreoathetosis movements (choreoathetosis) (as if he was scratching himself or pressing). Those movements 
have decreased considerably in relation with the day of first assessment on 1 Jun 2015. Mesazaline was 
suspended on 04 Jun 2015 after consultation with gastroenterologist but it was administered until 14 Jun 2015 due 
to an administrative mistake.
The physician considers due to the results of the tests that they have, that this was a confirmed diagnose of PML.

Additional MRI scans have not been performed since the one on 27 May 2015.The CSF samples were sent to 
reference lab in Madrid and (b) (6)  lab in US for JCV DNA PCR testing. The JCV DNA PCR from (b) (6)  was positive 
(693 copies/ml) from the sample taken on 29 May 2015. 
The MRI evaluation by External Expert (b) (6)  Basel): Presumptive diagnosis is suspicion
of PML (right greater than left frontal and mainly in the medial part of the Sylvian fissure right. There were only few 
lesions of MS (periventricular occipital, infiltrating the subcortical area, no contrast enhancement. Feature of PML 
was not absolutely typical, since the edges are sharp towards the medial parts and there is only a slight 
hypointensity in t1; U fibres seem to be spared. In comparison with the previous examination from 14 Aug 2014 with
27 May 2015 the following five new lesions and lesion distribution can be seen: Lesion 1 (MR8/5 = slice of 
examination): New hyper intense area with increased hyper intensity in the center, right frontal, above the orbital 
roof, extending into the fronto temporal area. Lesion 2 (MR9.5 to 7.5): A new extension of the right occipital area, 
extending from the right occipital horn into the parietal temporal area. The area nearly has the double size doubled 
in contrast to the 14 Aug 2014. In this area there are tiny little gd enhancing areas (MR28.11). Lesion 3 (MR7/5): 
Hyper intense area parieto occipital right, which was much higher intensity than in 2014. Lesion 4 (MR9/5): There 
were two new lesions parasagital, frontal, one on the right, one on the left, which were nearly symmetric, lying near 
the interhemispheric fissure. Lesion 5 (MR5.5): There was a well defined new lesion parasagital right in contrast to 
2014. In summary: In contrast to the previous examination from 2014 there are several new lesions, but also two 
clearly enlarging areas in lesion 2 (MR9.5 7.5), which show some enhancement typical for early stages of PML. 
Lesion 5 (MR5.5) looks like a new MS plaque, lesion 1 (MR8/5) looks like PML. The development of lesion 2 
(MR9.5 7.5) seems to be very long and shows clearly large extensions. Based on the comparison of these two 
examinations, the probability that the patient developed multicentered PML lesions seems to be very likely. The 
contrast enhancement in particular is not often seen in MS.
The MRI evaluation by External Expert ((b) (6)  Amsterdam): Compared to baseline scan, there are 
new atypical lesions, partly subcortical. No enhancement, high signal on DWI (ADC maaps missing). Differential 
diagnosis included PML, Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, toxic demyelination (perhaps due to medication for
ulcerative colitis). Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome was unlikely. The scans of 14 Aug 2014 and 02 
Dec 2013 showed a, ill defined lesion in the right parietal lobe that is somewhat atypical of MS, but is less 
edematous than the new lesions apparent on the scan of 27 May 2015 which raised the suspicion of PML. They 
also both show multiple more typical MS lesions that are stable; there is no contrast enhancement at either time 
point. All in all, it reinforces my previous interpretation that the new lesions on the scan of 27 May 2015 are indeed 
recent and indicative of PML.
On 8 Jun 2015: The patient showed clinical worsening. On 09 Jun 2015, brain MRI showed Cortico subcortical 
brain atrophy signs. Affectation white matter prone to confluence in T2 and FLAIR of both cerebral hemispheres,

asymmetrical with right predominance that does not rise up after intravenous contrast. This showed a worsening in 
his condition from 27 May 2015. No signs of Immune reconstruction inflammatory syndrome (IRIS). These findings 
are suggested of PML progression. The patient was treated with IV immunoglobulins from 09 Jun 2015 to 13 Jun 
2015 for five days at a dose of 25 gm/day. As of 11 Jun 2015, the patient was conscious and well oriented. Patient's
condition has not worsened compared to 09 Jun 2015. As of 15 Jun 2015, the patient's condition has not worsened 
compared to 11 Jun 2015. Physical examination: conscious, oriented, language difficulty, slow but correct answers. 
A lumber puncture on 16 Jun 2015, showed erythrocytes 677, leukocytes 2, glucose 72, protein 58, lactic acid 1.30.
JC BK VIRUS (CSF): PCR detected JC virus (second identification), pending quantification of the number of copies 
in local lab. The infectious disease consultant recommended cidofovir administration. As of 16 Jun 2015, the 
patient's condition remained similar as before. A basic blood analysis and a urine test which showed infection. From
15 Jun 2015, treatment was started with ciprofloxacin 200/12h mg IV. On 15 and 16 Jun 2015, the patient 
presented with fever (pyrexia) of 37.8 degree Celsius due to urinary infection (urinary tract infection).
Follow-up received on 17 Jun 2015: The patient received the first dose of cidofovir plus probenecid and it was well 
tolerated. The first two doses were given on a weekly frequency (on 17 Jun 2015 and 24 Jun 2015) and from that 
time on every two weeks (08 Jul 2015). As of 18 Jun 2015 the patient clinical condition was stable as before. On 23
Jun 2015, the patient presented with vomiting after the second cidofovir dose. Treatment for urinary infection was 
changed from ciprofloxacin to ampicillin. The patient was under assessment to start passive rehabilitation therapy.
On 27 Jun 2015: the physician stated that the patient's status was worse. The physician was not sure if this 
worsening was related to cidofovir or due to disease progression. It was reported that after the second dose of 
cidofovir the patient was feeling much more apathetic, did not speak, showed increased left hemineglect, increased
left hemibody weakness (asthenia) including facial weakness and increased mental slowness. The patient also 
presented with muscle atrophy due to immobility. Physical examination done on 28 Jun and 02 Jul 2015 showed 
little more worsening. On 30 Jun 2015 mefloquine was stopped. EEG on 02 Jul 2015, showed worsening compared
to previous EEGs.
The physician stated that no additional MRI was performed. The use of cidofovir was empiric. The therapeutic 
decision was made after clinical discussion with local infectologists. The physician thought both PML progression 
and cidofovir were contributing to patient condition getting worse. However, the main factor for that was PML in her 
opinion. The patient was in a very bad health condition. On 05 Jul the patient was started to choke on liquids 
(choking). As of 06 Jul 2015, the patient was not very talkative. Physician prescribed thickened water. Patient's 
neurological deficit has remained somehow stable. MRI was still pending due to patient's lack of cooperation, and 
would be performed with patient under sedation. Following doses of cidofovir and probenecid have been scheduled 
to be administered in day hospital care. According to magnetic resonance results, hospital discharge would be 
assessed. The patient was worsening every day, currently he only keeps eye contact during some seconds. The

patient did not speak, just said some unintelligible words every so often with dysphagia. Soft diet had been 
established. The MRI showed largest extension of lesions in all right side of brain, only remained part of the 
posterior side and half of the left side without affectation. It was decided to discontinue the treatment with cidofovir. 
It was not possible to stop the growth and expansion of the virus.
The physician reported that the worsening of the patient had stopped and he was recovering some functions. At the
moment of this report, the patient was feeded by gastrostomy (performed on 23 Jul 2015) and was under physic 
rehabilitation. On 14 Aug 2015 the patient was reactive. 
The outcome of the other events including PML was condition improving. The outcome of the events vomiting, JC 
virus test positive, pyrexia, blood immunoglobulin g decreased, blood immunoglobulin m decreased and urinary 
tract infection was not reported. The outcome of the events white blood cell count decreased and lymphocyte count 
decreased was reported as condition unchanged. The physician assessed vomiting as not suspected to treatment 
with Gilenya. The causality of the event PML was reported as possible (suspected) to Gilenya according to the 
reporting physician. 
Follow up received from physician on 28 Apr 2016: Report type changed from spontaneous to literature. Added 
author details, literature information, event (JC virus test positive). Updated event verbatim (difficulties walking).
