Case number# PHHY2015DE014957, is a report initially received from a physician on 05 Feb 2015 via sales 
representative, on 06 Feb 2015 via phone and site visit from a non-interventional study (study ID: (b) (6) )
((b) (6) ) along with targeted follow up checklists for suspected progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy 
(PML) and malignancy and neoplasm and via email on 09 Feb 2015, 11 Feb 2015, 12 Feb 2015, 13 Feb 2015 and 
15 Feb 2015 (combined report). This report refers to a 49-year-old male patient (center ID (b) (6)  patient ID: (b) (6) ) who
was enrolled in (b) (6)
(b) (6)
The patient had last MRI performed in 2009. The patient had first MS symptoms in Oct 2009. Treatment started 
with Rebif (interferon beta 1a) which was discontinued in mid-2009. The patient had an MS relapse on 17 Nov 
2009. MS was diagnosed on 23 Nov 2009. The patient was treated with corticosteroids in Dec 2009. The patient 
again had MS relapse in Mar 2010 with good response to steroids. There was no previous treatment with Tysabri 
(natalizumab) at any time. The patient was previously enrolled in two open label studies for overall treatment of 7 
months. The first study was (b) (6)  (center ID: (b) (6)  and patient ID: (b) (6) ) in which the patient received 
Gilenya (fingolimod) from 05 Oct 2010. The patient's absolute lymphocyte count (normal range: 1000-4050 /ul) was 
890 cells/uL on 28 Oct 2010, 710 cells/uL on 30 Nov 2010. During study (b) (6)  the patient suffered from 
common cold (non-serious) from 01 Feb 2011. The patient's absolute lymphocyte count was 560 cells/uL on 08 
Feb 2011. Treatment with Gilenya in study (b) (6)  was stopped on 08 Feb 2011. No relevant SAE or AE 
were reported during this period. The patient recovered from cold on 08 Feb 2011. The patient was then enrolled in 
the study (b) (6)  (center ID: (b) (6)  and patient ID: (b) (6) ) and received Gilenya from 09 Feb 2011. 
Treatment with Gilenya was discontinued on 11 May 2011. During these studies patient's absolute lymphocyte 
count varied between 0.56 to 1.82 x 10E9/L (normal range: 0.8 2.8 x 10E9/L). The patient was enrolled in non-
interventional study (b) (6)  on 11 May 2011 and started Gilenya 0.5 mg daily for MS (oral).
The patient's absolute lymphocyte count was 600 cells/uL on 11 May 2011 and 0.22 /ul on 18 Dec 2013. On 18 Dec
2013, the patient's lymphocyte count was 1.3 x10E9/L. On 20 May 2014, lab data showed absolute lymphocyte 
count 769 cells/uL, T lymphocytes (CD3) absolute 432 cells/uL (normal range: 700-2100), T Lymphocytes (CD3) 
relative 56 % (normal range: 60-85), T helper cells (CD3+CD4+) absolute 102 cells/uL (normal range: 400-400), T 
helper cells (CD3+CD4+) relative 13 % (normal range: 29 59) and CD4/CD8 ratio was 0.34 (normal range: 0.9-2.8).
On 09 Dec 2014, lab data showed absolute lymphocyte count 240 cells/uL (Lymphocyte count decreased 0.24 
10^9/L), T lymphocytes (CD3) absolute 152 cells/uL, T helper cells (CD3+CD4+) absolute 37 cells/uL, T helper 
cells (CD3+CD4+) rel 24 %, CD8 T cells (CD3+CD8+) absolute 102 cells/uL (200 900) and CD4/CD8 ratio 0.56. On

17 Dec 2014, blood sample was taken for JCV antibody testing and resulted positive (JC virus test positive). This 
test was run for JCV antibody status for risk stratification for potential later Tysabri treatment. At this point, there 
was no clinical reason for conducting this test, patient had no symptoms and there was no suspicion for PML. No 
MRI scans were performed between Nov 2009 and Jan 2015. The patient had a routine magnetic resonance 
imaging (MRI) with intravenous contrast enhancement on 23 Jan 2015 that revealed several new atypical lesions. 
This MRI was compared with that of 17 Nov 2009: MRI showed normal width of the inner and outer CSF spaces 
and no midline displacement, known sporadic demyelination foci measuring up to 1 cm in the supratentorial 
medullary layer on both sides. These demonstrate no diffusion disorder or contrast medium affinity. New larger 
extensive subcortical left temporal area hyperintense in T2 weighted images without signs of contrast material 
affinity or diffusion disorder. Further larger extensive, subcortical area hyperintense in T2 weighted images in the 
region of the right cerebellar hemisphere also without signs of contrast medium affinity or a diffusion disorder. No 
recognizable pathology in the region of the arterial and venous vascular structures, the pituitary and 
cerebellopontine region. Inhibited pneumatization of the right mastoid. Orbital contents were normal. Paranasal 
sinuses normally formed and ventilated. Based on image morphology, it was assessed to be a possible PML. MRI 
of the cervical spine with intravenous contrast enhancement on 23 Jan 2015 showed no evidence of a cervical 
manifestation of multiple sclerosis. Initial cervical deforming spondylosis. Secondary findings were modularly 
enlarged thyroid lobes predominantly on the left with relatively large left nodular lesion measuring 4 cm with 
contrast medium affinity and partly visible in the image. Based on the suspected nodular changes in the thyroid on 
MRI, the physician first suspected thyroid carcinoma. The patient had no other symptoms related to thyroid nodule. 
On 26 Jan 2015, Gilenya was discontinued. On 27 Jan 2015, CSF examination showed clear appearance, cell 
count and erythrocytes were less than 0.10 Mpt/L, lymphocytes 59.0 %, activated lymphocytes 7.0 %, monocytes 
33 %, macrophages 1.0 % and lactate 1.66 mmol/L. Laboratory interpretation was: normal albumin quotient, no 
blood brain barrier dysfunction and no intrathecal synthesis demonstrated. CSF PCR was done for JCV DNA in 
local lab in Germany from the sample taken on 27 Jan 2015 and one out of four samples was found to be JCV 
positive (weak result). CSF sample was investigated for Borrelia burgdorferi IgG and Borrelia burgdorferi IgM on 30 
Jan 2015, there were no signs of neuroborreliosis. The patient's lymphocyte count was above 200/microliter every 
time it was investigated. Lab data on 05 Feb 2015 showed absolute lymphocyte count 654 cells/uL, T lymphocytes 
(CD3) absolute 388 cells/uL, T lymphocytes (CD3) relative. 59 %, T helper cells (CD3+CD4+) absolute 127 
cells/uL, T helper cells (CD3+CD4+) relative 19 %, and CD4/CD8 ratio 0.49. Same CSF sample was sent to 
(b) (6)  in Denmark for DNA quantitative real time PCR and reported as positive on 06 Feb 2015: JCV with 43 
copies/ml. The MRIs were also reviewed by external expert physician: The baseline MRI (2009) had very few 
periventricular lesions, one quite large. Both are well demarcated as expected in MS. The recent MRIs (23 Jan 
2015) showed 2 new large abnormalities; one juxtacortical in the left temporal region and one in the right cerebellar 
hemisphere. Despite being new, they do not enhance and have a rather low signal on T1 weighted images and a 
fuzzy border; slightly high signal on DWI, but increased ADC (T2 shine through effect). Collectively, the lesions are 
atypical for MS due to absence of enhancement despite fuzzy/acute appearance. Given their locations and low

signal on T1, PML should be considered. The patient had weakness; however he did not have any clinical sign or 
symptoms specific to PML. The reporting physician suspected PML based on MRI finding and JCV DNA PCR 
results. No differential diagnosis was suspected. On 11 Feb 2015, anti JCV antibody specificity index (ASI JCV) 
testing was done in (b) (6)  Germany and the index was 23 (physiological limit 1.5). This test supported the 
diagnosis of PML. Around second week of Feb 2015, the patient was diagnosed with Helicobacter pylori associated
gastritis (Helicobacter gastritis) and huge cold thyroid node (thyroid neoplasm). On an unknown date HIV test was 
negative and colonoscopy was unremarkable. No treatment for suspected PML or suspected thyroid nodule was 
initiated yet. The patient is currently doing well and there is no sign or symptoms of PML. Follow up MRI was done 
on 03 Mar 2015 and MRI assessment from the local neuroradiologist indicated that previously identified lesions 
have slightly increased in this MRI when compared to the previous MRI and showed signs of IRIS. This MRI was 
also reviewed by external expert physician and in his opinion also, the lesions have increased in size in comparison 
to previous MRIs and it is consistent with PML IRIS. A repeat lumber puncture was done on 05 Mar 2015 and 
sample was send to(b) (6)  lab and (b) (6)  in Denmark for JCV DNA PCR and (b) (6)  Germany for ASI JCV. 
(b) (6)  lab detected 12 copies/ml in JCV DNA PCR. JCV copies were below detection limit in (b) (6)  Denmark. JCV 
ASI was below detection limit in (b) (6)  Germany. As of 19 Mar 2015, the patient was treated with mirtazapine
and mefloquine for PML. He was still doing fine and there was no clinical change. On 06 Apr 2015, the patient had 
another lumbar puncture and CSF was sent to (b) (6) . JCV DNA was not detectable in PCR. As of 07 Apr 2015, the 
patient was still well. In May 2015, MRI investigation showed similar results than before, but a slight regression of 
PML lesions. (b) (6)  confirmed via email on 14 May 2015 that again no JCV DNA was found in the patient's CSF 
sample (sample taken 04 May 2015) by JC Multiplex qPCR: "Result: Undetected". A Copaxone treatment was 
planned, but the patient did not agree to any further. In Sep 2015, the physician provided the last status of the 
patient, he reported that the patient was stable, no further treatment was initiated as the patient was skeptical 
regarding new MS treatments; and there was no change since then. The outcome of the event PML, thyroid 
neoplasm and central nervous system lesion was reported as condition unchanged for other events outcome was 
not reported. 
Seriousness assessment of the events was not reported by the physician. Seriousness assessment of (progressive
multifocal leukoencephalopathy, helicobacter gastritis and immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome) was 
upgraded based on the Novartis important medical events list. Seriousness assessment of (thyroid neoplasm) was 
upgraded based on the information available in the source document. Causality for the events helicobacter gastritis,
spinal deformity, spinal osteoarthritis, lymphocyte count decreased and immune reconstitution inflammatory 
syndrome was not reported and for other events was assessed as related to Gilenya therapy. 
Combined follow up report from a physician received on 17 Feb 2015 and 18 Feb 2015 from a non-interventional 
study (study ID: (b) (6) ): Event (helicobacter gastritis and thyroid neoplasm) and narrative updated.
