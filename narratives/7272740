This  trial-ease concerns a 64-year old Asian male patient. 
The patient's history included non-small cell lung-cancer and dry cough, three days prior to hospital 
admission. Concomitant medications consisted of folic acid, cyanocobatamin and dexamethasone for prophylaxis. 
On 1O-Aug-2009, the patient consented for this clinical trial. On 20-Aug-2009, the patient entered the concurrent 
phase and received the first dose of pemetrexed (Alimta) 500mg/m2 and cisplatin 75 mg/m2, both intravenously on 
an unspecified fr cy for three cycles in -0   .0  : '0 with   therapy 66 Gy133 fractions in total for the 
treatment of stage Ili non-small cell lung cancer. The last dose of pemetrexed and cisplatin given prior to the event 
onset during the concu rent phase of study was on 30-Sep-2009 and the last dose of radiation therapy 
administered a the concurrent phase was on 05-Oot-2009. Cyclical chemotherapy and radiation treatment for 
this phase was then concluded. On 04-Nov-2009, the patient started the consolidation phase and received the first 
dose of pemetrexed 500 mg/m2 intravenously on an unknown frequency for four cycles. The patient completed the 
,_phase and received the last dose of pernetrexeid prior to the event onset on 08-Jan-2010. On 14-Jan- 
204111,1he patient experienced dry cough, and on 16-Jan-2010, the patient e ,*-,----0 breattilessness at night. 
Approximatety three and a half months after last dose of cisplatin, three month two weeks after the last dose 
of radiation therapy and 10 days after the last dose of pemetrexed, on the patient was hospitalised for 
breathlessness, dry cough and fever. Hypoxia was also noted. On examination (not specified), bilateral pneumonia 
grade IV was diagnosed, which was considered life-threatening, and was in both side cif-lungs, but predominantly in 
the right side. On laboratory results  0;0: white blood cell count 2.1 ttletniul (ref. range not 
provided), net* ref. range not provided), hemoglobin 7.7 g/dI (13-17), platelets 102 x1_01'31111 (ref. range 
not provided), serum uric acid 2.2 mg/dl (ref. range 3.5-7.2) and albumin 2.2 OA (ref. range 3.5-5.2). The patient 
was placed on ventile,bon to maintain oxygen saturation and perfusion. On a sputum culture isolated

Temporary recovery from the hypaxia and other blood parameters was seen from to and 
results during this period included a potassium of 4.9 mrnolit. (normal range 3.5-5.1), serum 
of 98.0 maid& (  - 98-107) and a low serum se of 134 a L (normal range 136-145 was 
obserred. The patient started to deteriorate on11.11110 A computerised tomography scan of the thorax ondl. 
SliMsuggested evidence of enlarged and suborn sized mediastinal nodes with patchy areas of consolidation 
and ground glass haziness on both lungs, suspicion of infective/ inflammatory was suggested. Minimal pericardial 
effusion was present and the pulmonary lesions showed progression since 15-Jan-2010. An echocardiography the 
same day revealed a normal left ventricular function and left ventricular ejection fraction of 60%. 
further laboratory data displayed a haemoglobin of 10.60 galL (normal range 13-17), red a' 000 cell count of 3.36

urea of 216 mg/dL, serum uric acid et 19.1 rngidl_. serum creatinine of 5.6 nvidi (normal ranges same as 
previously reported), The liver function tests were also abnormal with a serum aspartate aminotransferase of 9820

potassium had also increased to 6.9 mmot/L (normal range 3.5-5.1). Treatment with calcium polystyrene sultanate 
for .0 7... and netiirnicin  ..o therapy were initiated on 28-Jan-2010 (no further details supplied). 
Subsequently the patient's  0  0" ion deteriorated further and he relapsed into a 
cardiorespiratory arrest, which resulted in death at 21:15 hrs. The cause of death was listed as the cardiorespiratory 
arrest due to pneumonia. No autopsy was performed. At the time of death, the event of bilateral pneumonia was 
unresolved. The reporting investigator stated that the event of bilateral pneumonia was possibly related to 
pernetraxed, cisplatin and radiotherapy, as pneumonia was present in the right lung where the relative radiotherapy 
doses were on the higher side and so the sequelae of radiotherapy in this area are prone to infection in patient 
feeekting chemotherapy. The fatal cardiorespiratory arrest was also considered to be related :to all study drugs and 
as o  due to the bilateral pneumonia. Both events were deemed not tote related to  o  a  a'a  0 :dares.
