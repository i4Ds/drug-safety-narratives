Medically Significant
A registered nurse from the neurologist's office reported that a 44 year old female patient on TYSABRI (300 mg, IV,
QM) for Multiple Sclerosis from 07 Apr 2011 to 02 Apr 2014 experienced suspected PML (onset 15 Apr 2014). At 
the time of this report, the TOUCH database indicated the patient received a total of 40 doses of TYSABRI from 07 
Apr 2011 to 02 Apr 2014. The patient has prior immunosuppressant exposure, believed to be Novantrone 
(mitozantrone).  The patient tested positive for JCV antibodies in Mar 2011 and the most recent JCV antibody index
in Jan 2014 was 2.5.  On 15 Apr 2014 the patient presented with new/worsening symptoms including difficulty with 
balance, swallowing, and ambulation related to weakness.  The patient received treatment with IV steroids.  An MRI
was performed which the physician thinks may have a new lesion which is suspecious for PML.  The patient is not 
hospitalized and is scheduled for a lumbar puncture on 23 Apr 2014.  The event of suspected PML is ongoing. The 
causality for the event of suspected PML is unknown.  TYSABRI therapy was stopped temporarily.
Update 24 Apr 2014: A neurologist spontaneously reported, via a Biogen Idec Area Busienss Manager, that a 44 
year old female patient on TYSABRI possibly has PML.  The neurologist is waiting for test results and MRI.  The 
outcome for the event was unknown.  The causality was assessed as related to TYSABRI.  TYSABRI therapy 
continues.
Update 06 May 2014: During an outbound phone call, a registered nurse from the neurologist's office reported the 
patient's CSF was negative from (b) (6)  (presume negative for JCV DNA) and the patient continues to be 
asymptomatic with no new complaints.  TYSABRI remains on hold pending a follow-up MRI to be performed at the 
end of May.
Update 07 May 2014: Biogen Idec considers this case to be high suspect for PML based on MRI results.  MRI on 
16 Apr 2014 had findings consistent with unilobar PML in right occipital lobe without enhancement.
Update 08 May 2014: A registered nurse reported that written results of CSF testing from (b) (6)  were not yet 
back, however, the physician was advised that the sample was JCV negative.  The patient was doing well without 
any new issues and continues to be monitored by the physician.
Update 13 May 2014: Recent MRI results were provided.  On 06 Mar 2013, MRI of the brain revealed foci of 
abnormal signal intensity in the deep periventricular white matter and centrum semiovale on both sides, unchanged 
in size and number from the prior study of 10 May 2012 and consistent with the clinical diagnosis of MS.  The 
largest lesion was located in the left centrum semiovale measuring 12.0 x 5.0 mm, unchanged.  No abnormal 
enhancement was seen.  On 25 Sep 2013, MRI of the brain revealed few foci of abnormal signal intensity in the 
deep periventricular white matter and centrum semiovale on both sides unchanged in size and number from the 
prior study of 06 Mar 2013.  No abnormal enhancement was seen, unchanged.  On 16 Apr 2014, MRI of the brain

revealed several small foci of increased Flair signal involving the deep periventricular white matter and the centrum 
semiovale on both sides, similar in size and appearance compared to prior study dated 25 Sep 2013.  No abnormal 
enhancement was seen.  New area of signal abnormality in the right occipital region may be related to early PML 
given history of positive JCV test and Tysabri protocol.  There was no corresponding enhancement.  Follow-up 
study including gadolinium enhanced images was suggested.
Update 21 May 2014: The patient reported via Monitored Therapy that the "left side of body is heavy and unstable" 
(presumed symptom of suspected PML) and that she is emotionally unstable (onset unknown). Testing included a 
spinal tap, testing positive for the JC Virus, and an MRI in May 2014 which showed that there was "white matter 
found on brain" (presumed in reference to previously reported white matter abnormalities noted on MRI; discrepant 
information). Treatment was not provided. The patient stated that the "left side of body is heavy and unstable" and 
the event emotionally unstable are both ongoing. Causality was not provided by the patient. TYSABRI therapy was 
permanently discontinued (discrepant information).
Update 29 May 2014: Biogen Idec considers this case to remain as high suspect PML pending a repeat MRI and 
clinical update.
Update 08 Jul 2014: A registered nurse from the neurologist's office responded to an outbound phonecall.  The 
patient was seen in the ER over the weekend for her MS.  The RN thinks the patient was treated with steroids, was 
not admitted, and is having a repeat brain MRI today. She is currently on Copaxone (glatiramer acetate) for her MS.
The nurse reported that the neurologist agreed to have Biogen Idec review the MRI images and will provide them.
Update 15 Jul 2014: The neurologist's office provided MRI images on CD from 19 Jun 2014 and 08 Jul 2014.No 
other information was provided. 
Update 18 Jul 2014: A registered nurse from the neurologist's office reported, via a Biogen Account Business 
Manager, that the patient went for a second opinion.  That physician suspects the patient has PML.  No further 
information was provided.
Update 18 Jul 2014: A registered nurse from the neurologist's office reported that the patient had confirmed PML 
and had gone for a second/third opinion.   The nurse had requested information regarding how to treat PML.
Update 22 Jul 2014: The neurologist reported that she feels this is a definite case of PML based on the MRI read.
The last dose of TYSABRI was months ago and the patient is being watched at this point.  She was treated for a 
questionable exacerbation in June [2014], which was suspected to be IRIS. The patient is relatively stable with mild 
field cut, very mild hemiparesis, and is ambulatory with mild ataxia.  The patient does not want to do another lumbar

puncture.
Update 22 Jul 2014: Additional information received indicated the patient was not planned for a biopsy and was 
unlikely to receive another tap (presume lumbar puncture).
Update 24 Jul 2014: The patient's sisteer reported the patient experienced lesion on optical nerve, greater optical 
nerve, and white matter of her brain and lost 60% of vision out of both eyes (onset Apr 2014) (presumed signs and 
symptoms of PML). The patient has not yet recovered. No further information was provided.
Update 31 Jul 2014: The treating neurologist reported the patient had clinically and MRI definite PML, now with 
severe IRIS.  No further CSF analysis was schedule to be performed.
Update 05 Dec 2014: Follow-up information was received from the neurologist, via a TOUCH Prescribing Program 
Form.  The patient was alive and had experienced PML / opportunistic infection [presume in reference to PML] for 
which they were hospitalized.
Update 12 May 2015: The patient reported via a Biogen program of Monitored Therapy that she had PML and the 
only lasting effect is that she is now blind in her left eye. The patient is starting Plegridy (peginterferon beta-1a).
Update 02 Jun 2015: The patient reported that she developed PML in Apr 2014 and stopped Tysabri.  She said that
she "almost died" and that she was hospitalized and treated for PML from (b) (6)  to (b) (6)  when she 
recovered.  She became blind in her left side as a result of PML.  Previous medication included Avonex (interferon 
beta-1a) until 12 May 2000.
