This Clinical Trial 
reported by a Study nves or, concerns a  yea o  ma e pa ien eica ory: Pepr - 
disorder, Alcohol abuse, Tobacco user, Drug abuse, Head and neck cancer. Concomitant Medication(s): fentanyl 
and oxycodone. The patient began the study therapy, on 01-Aug-2011, cetuximab 400 mg intravenous (IV) loading 
dose weekly, then 350 mg weekly, on 09-Aug-2011, pemetrexed 500 mg/m2 IV on day one every 21 days and 
bevacizumab 15 mg/kg IV on day one every 21 days, and radiation therapy starting on 09-Aug-2011, daily Monday 
through Friday with a total of 70 Gy for the indication of head and neck cancer. The last doses of the study therapy 
were on 29-Sep-2011. On L days since the start of cetuximab andalklays since the start of 
pemetrexed and bevacizumab, the patient was brought to the emergency room (ER) by his sister because he 
looked terrible. The patient was admitted to the hospital with transient hypotension, grade 4, nonspecific 
tachycardia, grade 3, dehydration, grade 3, and chronic pain, grade 2. There was a suspicion of sepsis, source 
unknown. The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). On 111111111111111, he had the following 
laboratory tests: sodium 134, potassium 3.4, chloride 89, lactate 4.0, and blood cultures were negative (no units or 
ranges reported). A sputum culture showed rare Gram positive cocci in pairs, rare Gram positive rods, very rare 
Gram negative rods, heavy polymorphonuclear cells, no epithelial cells. An electrocardiogram showed sinus 
tachycardia with a rate of 107, right axis deviation, normal intervals and no acute ST segment elevation or 
depression. A chest x-ray showed no acute process and no evidence of pneumonia. Admission vital signs were as 
follows: temperature: 36.7 C, blood pressure 96/63, heart rate 149, respiratory rate 24, and oxygen saturation 100% 
on room air. On 41111111111. the patient developed significant bradycardia with a heart rate less than 50. He was 
treated with normal saline, norepinephrine, zosyn, and vancomycin. Nutrition was primarily through his PEG tube. 
The patient was discharged from the hospital on with blood pressure and heart rate within normal 
limits. The final diagnoses were malignant neoplasm of head, face, and neck, hypovolemic shock, and pneumonia 
NOS. Hypotension, bradycardia, tachycardia, and dehydration were symptoms of the diagnosis of hypovolemic 
shock. According to the investigator, hypovolemic shock was due to dehydration and pneumonia was due to 
aspiration. The study drugs were continued. The study investigator considered the events of hypovolemic shock 
and pneumonia NOS to not be related to pemetrexed, radiation, cetuximab and bevacizumab. Chronic pain was 
possibly related to pemetrexed, cetuximab, radiation and bevacizumab. The relatedness for protocol procedures 
was not reported. Update 18-Oct-2011: Additional information received on 17-Oct-2011 from the study investigator. 
The patient number was provided. The last doses of the study therapy were provided, the action taken for the study 
drugs was provided. The new serious adverse event of bradycardia was added. The hospital discharge date was 
added, the outcome for two of the events was amended. The relevant fields and narrative were updated 
accordingly. Update 27-Oct-2011: Additional information received on 25-Oct-2011 from the study investigator.

FOIA Case Report Information 
Hypovolemic shock and pneumonia NOS were added as new events. Since the investigator reported hypotension, 
bradycardia, dehydration, and tachycardia to be symptoms of hypovolemic shock; they were removed as events. 
The start date and date of last dose of radiation were provided. The relevant fields and narrative were updated 
accordingly. Update 11-Nov-2011: Additional information was received from the study investigator on 07-Nov-
2011. Causality updated to not related for cetuximab. The cause of hypovolemic shock and pneumonia added to 
file. Corresponding fields and narrative updated accordingly.
