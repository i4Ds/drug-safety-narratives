Medically Significant
A neurologist spontaneously reported that a  female patient on TYSABRI (300 mg, IV, QM) for Multiple Sclerosis 
from unknown date to unknown date was under evaluation for experienced suspect PML (onset unknown). The 
patient tested positive for JCV Abs presence (index: 2.664). She previously had been on mitoxantrone (dates 
unknown). The last TYSABRI infusion was approximately  20-Aug-2014, and it was likely the 36th infusion. The 
patient was asymptomatic and on 27-Aug-2014 she underwent an MRI which showed a new not enhancing lesion 
in the right occipital area, involving both white matter and cortex. On 28 Aug 2014 the patient will undergo a lumbar 
puncture in order to ship a CSF sample to(b) (6)  lab. The outcome for the event suspect PML is unknown. The 
causality for the event of suspect PML is unknown.  It is unknown if TYSABRI treatment is ongoing.

label treatment with maraviroc on 08 Sep 2014. JCV Abs  tested positive on 10 Jul 2013 (index: 2.664). At the 
reporting time the patient was at hospital. The first TYSABRI dose was administered on 21 Jun 2010 and the last 
one on 24 Aug 2014. MS was diagnosed in June 2004 and it occurred along with right arm paresthesia. The patient
received mitoxantrone  (IV, Qmonth) therapy from April 2005 to June 2005 for RRMS. The patient received Rebif 
(44 mcg, SC, 3 times a week) from Apr 2005 to Dec 2009. then Copaxone (glatiramer acetate) (20 mg, SC, daily) 
from February 2010 to May 2010. The patient underwent 4 PLEX cycles (29 Aug 2014; 1 Sep 2014; 3 Sep 2014 
and  5 Sep 2014). The patient's PML was treated with mirtazapine (15 mg, PO, QD) and maraviroc (300 mg, PO, 
BID) since 8 Sep 2014 and ongoing. Data collection Forms were also received that reported the patient was 
asymptomatic. CSF results from the 28 Aug 2014 lumbar puncture are pending. The event of PML is ongoing. 
Update 23 Sep 2014: A neurologist of the MS centre spontaneously reported, via a Biogen Idec MSL, that the 
patient tested positive for the presence of the JCV DNA in the CSF sample sent to (b) (6)  lab on 01 Sep 2014 (80 
copies/ml). The patient was clinically stable and asymptomatic. At the reporting time, she was still under maraviroc 
therapy (from 09 Sep 2014) and she was responding to this treatment.
Update 26 Sep 2014: The treating neurologist reported, via a Biogen Idec MSL, that the last MRI performed on 25 
Sep 2014 showed a stable picture without any enhancement. The patient was good and was still continuing Maviroc
therapy.
Update 02 Oct 2014: Upon internal review, Biogen Idec considers this case to be confirmed for PML based on the 
positive CSF and MRI findings.
Update 09 Feb 2015: Additional information was received from the neurologist via a MS Standardized PML Data 
Collection Tool. The patient s height and weight at time of PML diagnosis were 160 cm and 50 kg, respectively. 
Suspect product was confirmed to be TYSABRI (300 mg, administered every 5 weeks). The following test results 
from 30 Jun 2009 (prior to TYSABRI) were reported: leukocyte count 3.01 x 1000/microliter (normal range 4.5 to 
11); lymphocyte count 49.1 %; absolute lymphocyte count 1.48 x 1000/microliter (normal range 0.9 to 5.2). The 
neurologist assessed the patient s estimated Karnofsky and EDSS scores to be 90 (able to carry on normal 
activity; minor signs or symptoms of disease) and 2.0 on the following dates: 20 May 2010, 19 Feb 2014 and 10 
Sep 2014. The patient tested positive for serum anti-JCV antibodies on 04 Apr 2011 and on 10 Jul 2014 (index 
2.664). Test results from 28 May 2014 (prior to PML) were reported: leukocyte count 8.05 x 1000/microliter; 
lymphocyte count 55.7 %; absolute lymphocyte count 4.48 x 1000/microliter; lymphocyte subset analysis = 1980, 
631.6, 3.1. An MRI was performed prior to PML diagnosis on 15 Jul 2014 (results not provided). The patient had a 
negative HIV test result on 13 Aug 2014. An MRI was performed on 27 Aug 2014 (previously reported). A lumbar 
puncture was performed on 28 Aug 2014. CSF JCV DNA was tested on 30 Aug 2014 and was positive at 80 copies
per mL (NIH). Test results from 28 Aug 2014 (pre-PLEX) were reported: leukocyte count 11.2 x 1000/microliter;

lymphocyte count 57.6 %; absolute lymphocyte count 5.89 x 1000/microliter. The patient was negative for anti-
natalizumab antibodies on an unspecified date. The patient was diagnosed with IRIS, which was determined by 
clinical symptoms and MRI findings. Symptoms included right lateral hemianopsia (visual; onset date Oct 2014). 
The patient did not receive corticosteroids pre-IRIS. Treatment for IRIS included methylprednisolone 1000 mg IV 
daily from 01 Nov 2014 to 05 Nov 2014; methylprednisolone 1000 mg IV daily from 10 Nov 2014 to 17 Nov 2014; 
and maraviroc 300 mg PO twice daily from 05 Sep 2014 to 10 Nov 2014. At the time of the report, the patient was 
alive and was residing at home. She had not recovered from PML and had not recovered from IRIS. Causality for 
the events was assessed by the neurologist as related to TYSABRI.
Update 19 Feb 2015: Follow-up information received indicated the patient was enrolled in the (b) (6)
 with subject(b) (6)  PML was diagnosed via MRI on 27 Aug 2014. The 
patient had no symptoms until the end of Sep and then she had visual problems. The patient was hospitalized from 
(b) (6)  to (b) (6) . Treatment included rituximab, maraviroc, and Remeron (mirtazapine). The event of 
PML was assessed as medically significant, severe and the patient had not yet recovered. In response to the event 
of PML, TYSABRI was permanently discontinued on 20 Aug 2014. The investigator considered the event related to 
TYSABRI.
Update 03 Apr 2015: Additional information was received from the neurologist via a MS Standardized PML Data 
Collection Tool. The patient is alive, residing at home, and is not currently on any MS therapy. On 13 Jan 2015, the 
neurologist assessed the patient's estimated Karnofsky and EDSS scores to be 80 (normal activity with effort; some
signs or symptoms of disease) and 2.5, respectively. A brain MRI was performed on 13 Jan 2015 (results not 
provided). The following post-PML lab results from 03 Dec 2014 were reported: leukocyte count 4720 (normal 
range 4.5 - 11.0); [relative] lymphocyte count 49% (normal range 19 - 48); and absolute lymphocyte count 2.32 
(normal range 0.90 - 5.20). As of 13 Jan 2015, the patient has recovered from PML and has recovered from IRIS. 
Causality for the events was not assessed.
Update 03 Aug 2015: Follow-up information received reported corrections to treatment medications: Maraviroc 
started on 01 Sep 2014 and Remeron (mirtazapine) started on 10 Sep 2014.  Steroids were started for PML 
treatment on 24 Oct 2014 and 10 Nov 2014. Additional treatment included PLEX started on 29 Aug 2014 and 
levetiracetam started on 03 Nov 2014.
Update 19 Aug 2015:  A report was received from literature.  Spadaro M, Caldano M, Marnetto F, Lugaresi A, 
Bertolotto A.  Natalizumab treatment reduces L-selectin (CD62L) in CD4+ T cells.  J Neuroinflammation.  12 Aug 
2015; 12(146):  1-9.  The authors stated that their research confirms that TYSABRI has a specific effect on 
CD62LCD4+ T cells consisting in decreasing of the number of positive cells. The low level of CD62L found in a 
clinically asymptomatic PML patient strengthens its potential usefulness as a biomarker of high PML risk in

TYSABRI -treated patients. No additional information was provided.
Update 27 Aug 2015: Additional information was received from the neurologist via a MS Data Collection Tool. The 
patient is currently alive, living at home, and the patient is currently not on any therapy for MS. The neurologist 
assessed the patient s estimated Karnofsky and EDSS scores on 15 Jul 2015 to be 100 (normal no complaint; no 
evidence of disease) and 2.5. The most recent brain MRI was performed on 15 Jul 2015 with the following result: 
no new T2 lesions, no evidence of gadolinium-enhancing T1 lesions. Lesion load is unchanged. The patient was 
assessed on 15 Jul 2015 as recovered from PML and IRIS. Causality for the events was assessed as related to 
TYSABRI.
