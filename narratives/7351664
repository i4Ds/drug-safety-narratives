This double-blind clinical trial caseallilIMINIMINIMINIMIconcerns a 63-year-old male 
patient of unknown ethnicity. The patterirs medical history included pneumonia in 1964. There was no history of 
cardiovascular disease (angina, hypertension, previous myocardial infarction Mt), neither risk factors for MI such as 
hypercholesterolernia, smoking, obesity, or any familial history. Concomitant medications consisted of oxycodone 
hycirociOciride (Oxycontin), ternazeparn, paracetamol and oxycodone hydrochloride (Endone) for pain, 
ole magnesium for reflux, docusate sodium/sennoside a+b for constipation and celecoxib for insomnia. 
The patient received folic acid, vitamin B12 and dexamethasone for prophylaxis as per protocol. On 22-Feb-2010, 
the pafient started the open-label induction phase of the study and first received pemetrexed (Alimta) 500 mg/m2 
and cisplatin 75 rng/rn2, both intravenously on day one every 21 days for the treatment of advanced nonsquamous 
non-small cell, cancer. The last dose of both study drugs prior to the event onset was administered on 15-Mar- 
201-0. On. Odays after receiving the last dose of pemetrexed and cisplatin, the patient was ted 
to hospital with shortness of breath and tachycardia, both common toxicity criteria grade three. Laboratory results 
the same day as admission showed a haemoglobin of 127 g/l. (normal range 135-175), red 0 06. cell count of 4.18 
x1-0Al2/1: (normal range 4.50-6.00), platelet count of 310 x10A9/L (normal range 150-400), white cell count of 8.09 
x10A9IL (normal range 4.00-11.00), sodium of 131 mind& (normal range 137-145), potassium of 4.6 mmolIL 
range 3.5-4.9), urea of 7.5 mmol/L (normal range 2.7-8.G), creatinine of 54 umol/L (normal range 50-120), 
Gamma-giutarnyltransferase of 439 LI& (normal range < 60), alkaline phosphatase of 427 Utt. (normal range 30-
110), alanine amino-transferase of 26 U/L. (normal range < 55.), aspartate aminotransf  se of 37 UIL (normal 
range < 45) and creatine kinase of 87 Ult. (normal range < 250). The next day on further tests 
revealed a creatine phosphokinase of 91 (normal  < 250) and creatine phosphokinase MB isoenzyme 
24-	 (normal range < 7.0). A troponin T level of 0.110 ug/L (normal range 0.1 e A .020) was also noted on or
onfi  
the report stated that a troponin T > 0.1 ugIL indicates myocardial damage and in a patient with 
acute coronary syndrome, this result would be consistent with a myocardial infarction. Upon follow-up information, 
MI was not c. . The abnormal tests results were considered to be related to disease progression. Corrective 
treatment palliative care only. On 11111111 the patient died due to disease progression. It was 
whether an autopsy was perform . Both tachycardia and dyspnoea were ongoing till death. No action 
alai taken with study drugs prior to patient's death. The patient had not yet started the blinded maintenance phase 
of the trial. In the investigator's opinion, the dyspnoea and tachycardia were related to the use of pemetrexed and 
cisplatin and unrelated to protocol procedures. Update 19-May-2010: Additional information received on 10-May-
2010; negative medical history of cardiovascular disease and no risk factors for Ml, corrective therapy, abnormal 
tests results confirmed to be due to disease progression, date and cause of death (disease progression, unrelated 
to study drugs). Narrative, PSUR comment and relevant fields updated.
