Medically Significant
A neurologist spontaneously reported via Biogen Employee (MSL, Medical Science Liaison) that a 62 year old male 
patient on TYSABRI (300 mg, IV, QM) for Multiple Sclerosis from 2009 to 2015 experienced suspect PML (onset 
unknown). The patient is JCV positive with titer value of 2.4. The patient has been having 3 months of behavioral 
changes and worsening gait (onset unknown). MRI scan performed on 09 Apr 2015 showed extensive cerebellum 
and brainstem changes that was not present in the MRI performed in Dec 2014. CSF JCV DNA PCR test was done
last week and results were expected this week. At the time of this report, the patient was holding steady and was 
undergoing plasma exchange for treatment of suspect PML. The reporting neurologist was quite sure that it is a 
PML case. The event of suspect PML is ongoing. The causality for the event of suspect PML is unknown.
TYSABRI therapy was discontinued.

FOIA Case Report Information
Update 17 Apr 2015: Upon follow-up, the neurologist confirmed that the patient tested positive for CSF JCV DNA 
with titer values 97,000 copies/ml.  At the time of this report, the patient had completed PLEX (plasma exchange) 
treatment for the event of suspect PML. 
Update 21 Apr 2015: The neurologist provided additional information via a Suspect PML Data Collection Form and 
medical records. The patient was diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis (MS) on 01 Jan 2003. The MS symptoms prior 
to suspect PML included moderate paraparesis, and moderate ataxia (onsets 16 Apr 2012). The patient did not 
receive any immunosuppressant or immunomodulatory therapy. TYSABRI (300 mg, IV, QM) therapy was started on
11 Jul 2008. On 12 Feb 2015, the patient presented cognitive/behavioral symptoms of aggression; on 01 Mar 2015,
the patient presented motor and focal symptoms of worsening lower limb strength and cerebellar symptoms of 
worsening ataxia. On 16 May 2008, prior to starting TYSBRI, laboratory testing included leukocyte count: 7.3 x 
10^9/L (reference range: 4-11) and lymphocyte count: 3.1 X 10^9/L (reference range: 1.2-4.0). On 06 Jun 2014, 
prior to PML suspicion and on TYSBRI, laboratory testing included leukocyte count: 11.3 x 10^9/L (reference range:
4-11) and lymphocyte count: 4.5 X 10^9/L (reference range: 1.2-4.0). On (b) (6)  at the time of PML suspicion
(pre-PLEX), laboratory testing included leukocyte count: 14.5 x 10^9/L (reference range: 4-11), lymphocyte count: 
6.2 X 10^9/L (reference range: 1.2-4.0), White blood cell count 14.5 x 10^9/L (reference range: 4.0-11.0), and 
monocyte count 1.3 x 10^9/L (reference range: 0.1-1.0). The patient was tested positive for anti-JCV antibody 
status on 16 Sep 2011 and 31 Mar 2013 at (b) (6)  Denmark. On 19 Jun 2014, the patient was tested positive for 
anti-JCV antibody with index value of 2.4. MRI performed on 13 Sep 2014 showed innumerable white matter 
lesions throughout the cerebral hemispheres bilaterally; appearance, number and distribution of the lesions 
unchanged since previous MRI. MRI performed on 05 Dec 2014 showed white matter T2 hyperintense regions 
stable in appearance and number, no definite new lesions identified. MRI performed on (b) (6)  showed 
moderately large areas of FLAIR hypersensitivity in cerebellum, asymmetrically, left greater that right; mild 
associated predominantly peripheral diffusion restriction; findings highly suspicious for PML involving posterior 
fossa. MRI performed on (b) (6)  showed confluent FLAIR hyperintensity within white matter of cerebellar 
hemispheres bilaterally, more extensive on left; findings remained highly suspicious for posterior fossa PML 
(L>R).MRI performed on (b) (6)  showed no significant change in appearance of cerebellum compared to 
previous MRI; due to lack of progression and clinical stability, the findings were most likely representing posterior 
fossa PML without immune reconstitution syndrome. On (b) (6)  a lumbar puncture was performed and the 
CSF JCV DNA resulted positive with 97,680 copies/ml. A brain biopsy has not been performed. On (b) (6) ,
CSF analysis was performed that resulted abnormal with high protein levels of 0.79 g/L (reference range: < 0.45) 
and glucose levels: 4.6 mmol/L (reference range: 2.2-3.9). The treatment for the event of PML included 5 sessions 
PLEX (plasma exchange) on (b) (6) (b) (6) (b) (6) (b) (6)  and (b) (6)  Treatment 
medications also included Mefloquine (250 mg, PO, QD), Mirtazapine (60 mg, PO, QD), and Maraviroc (300 mg, 
PO, BD) from 08 Apr 2015. The patient is currently in hospital.

FOIA Case Report Information
Update 23 Apr 2015: Biogen considers this case to be a confirmed case of PML based on positive CSF, consistent 
radiological findings, and clinical symptoms.
Update 20 May 2015: Follow-up information received included MRI images for the following dates: 13 Oct 2014, 05 
Dec 2014, and (b) (6)  MRI reports were not provided.
Update 30 Jul 2015: Additional information was received from the neurologist via a MS Standardized PML Data 
Collection Tool. The patient was further identified via a date of birth and age corrected to 59 years old. The patient 
is alive and currently residing at a nursing home. The suspect product was confirmed to be TYSABRI (300 mg, 
monthly).  On unknown date prior to starting TYSABRI and in 2007 and on TYSABRI prior to PML in 2010, the 
patient's Karnofsky and EDSS scores were assessed as 60 (requires occasional assistance, but is able to care for 
most of his personal needs) and 6.5. On (b) (6)  at the time of diagnosis of PML, the patient's Karnofsky and 
EDSS scores were assessed as 40 (disabled; requires special care and assistance) and 7.0. The patient tested 
negative for HIV on unknown date.  CSF analysis from (b) (6)  showed high CSF glucose 4.6 mmol / L 
(reference range 2.2 - 3.9), high CSF protein 0.79 g/L (reference range <0.45), oligoclonal banding of weak 
intensity noted, and CSF was clear in appearance.  Brain MRIs were performed on 30 Apr 2015, 12 May 2015, and 
05 Jun 2015 (results were not provided). A lumbar puncture was performed on 05 Jun 2015 which was positive for 
CSF JCV DNA with 28,000 copies / mL. CSF analysis on 05 Jun 2015 showed high CSF protein 0.83 g/L 
(reference range <0.45) and CSF glucose of 3.4 mmol / L (reference range 2.2-3.9); the CSF was blood stained but
the supernatant appeared clear with no growth after two days.  A brain MRI was performed on 25 Jun 2015 with the
following result: progression of T2 and FLAIR abnormality in the right middle cerebellar peduncle, right cerebellar 
hemisphere, and left cerebellar hemisphere with increased mass effect; although this was a non-contrast scan, the 
increased mass effect would be keeping with PML - IRIS. The patient was diagnosed with IRIS determined by MRI 
findings and clinical symptoms of speech - worsening dysarthria (onset 10 Jun 2014), cognitive / behavioral - 
lethargy and confusion, motor / multifocal - worsening arm ataxia and worsening paraparesis, and cerebellar-
worsening arm ataxia (onsets 26 Jun 2015). The patient did not receive corticosteroids pre-IRIS onset. The patient 
did receive corticosteroids post-IRIS onset of methylprednisolone (1 g, IV, daily) from 26 Jun 2015 to 30 Jun 2015. 
A brain MRI was performed on 03 Jul 2015 with the following results: there was overall stable extent of T2 
hyperintense lesions in the supratentorial and the infratentorial brain compartments; there was interval peripheral 
enhancement in the right cerebellar lesion as detailed. The patient was assessed on 03 Jul 2015 as not recovered 
from events of PML and IRIS. Causality for the events of PML and IRIS was assessed as related to TYSABRI.
