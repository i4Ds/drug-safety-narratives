This observational post marketing non-interventional study (H3E-EW-B002, EudraCT number not provided) case 
concerns a 72-year old Caucasian male patient. The patient's medical history included non-small cell lung cancer, 
and depression. Concomitant medications included: carvedilol for the treatment of cardiomyopathy, 
sertraline for the treatment of depression, time for an unreported. indication, lorazepam for the treatment of 
insomnia, omeprazole as gastric  a  ro ..taxis, ferrous sulfate/folic acid for the treatment of anaemia, centrum 
(vitamins and minerals) as prophylaxis,  terot acetate for the treatment of anorexia, .'a and fiuticasooe 
pre 0 . 0 . to for the treatment of . is obstructive pulmonary disorder (COPD) and furosemide for an unreported 
indication. The patient also received folic acid, cy- , a 0.  o  min and dexamethasone as per protocol procedures. 
On 11-Oct-2007 the patient first received. errietrexect (Alirnta) cycle one 905 mg intrave. e , every three weeks 
for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer. On 22-Oct-2007, 12 days after the first dose of o trexed, the 
patient presented with fever without symptoms. Blood analysis was performed and due to low neutrophils and 
platelets the patient was .    ,a' ' o  the sarne day. 0* tory test results dated 22-Oct-2007: neutrophils 0.3 x 
1049/L (1.9-7.5) and platelets 32 x10"9/1_ (150450). The patient was diagnosed with febrile neutropenia. The 
patient received amoxicilliniclavulanic acid, azithrornycin and platelets transfusion as corrective treatment. 
Laboratory results dated 23-Oct-2007: platelets 1.9 x 10"9/L (150-450) and C-reactive protein (CRP) 16.8 mg/dl 
(60.5.). The patient recovered from febrile neti , .0.  =  on 31-Oct-2007. The event febrile neutropenia did not result 
in permanent discontinuation.ofthe study drug pemetrexed. The study investigator stated that the event febrile 
neutropenia was possibly related toperrietrexed and not related to the 0 a a  ol procedures as the study is non- 
interventional. The patient- ..0 edin the stud. and last received.the study drug pernetrexed at a reduced dose of

pre _  -  ..e to the erner .  room with a fever of 38 degrees Celsius. Laboratory results were performed and the 
patient had a high value of protein C-reactive protein. (CRP). He was hospitalised due to respiratory infection with 
febrile neutropenia on 1544ov-2007. Laboratory results on 1:5-Nov-2007 included: CRP 14.9 nigldl (normal 
<.5), leucocytes 2.72 x 10,W (normal range 4.0-11.0), neutrophils 4.343 x 10"9/1. The patient was diagnosed with 
prieurrionia. The event  neutropenia was considered serious for . e. o alisation. The "otics 
amoxicillin/clavulanic acid and azithrornycin were discontinued. On he patient had aggravated 
dyspnoea and hipexemia. The study investigator suspected it was a pulmonary thrornboembollsm (added as 
serious other as per :  . physician:). During the hospitalization (on the patient experienced 
global .atory insufficiency due to pneumonia. The patient was tre with unfractionated heparin, and for the 
respiratory insufficiency he received tazobactam, ipratropium bromidetsalbu , ace . '  , prednisolone, 
morphine and .fraction inspired oxygen (100%) which were all reportedly s o e e e on the day the 
patient died. On 0 a it was r that the treatments were s 000 0.because the patient died. The cause of 
death as per the death certificate was global respiratory insufficiency due to a pneumonia and the investigator 
thought that this was possibly related to the pulmonary thr0-.   00.r. ... o. ism. No laboratory tests were provided to the

neuVopenia were possibly related to pemetrexed. For the event suspected pulmonary throm o o e ism the 
investigator stated that It was possibly related to the disease and not pernetrexed. The death was considered

Update: 29-Nov-2007: Additional information received from site on 16-Nov-2007. Added event of respiratory 
infection, concomitant medications, laboratory test values, event recovered (to be confirmed) Narrative, PSUR and
