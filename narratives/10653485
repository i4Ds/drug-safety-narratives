AER 1506856 is a spontaneous case, received on 10/Dec/2014 from a hematologist and concerns a 69 year old 
male patient (source identification number: (b) (6) ) who developed gastroenteritis, febrile infection, dysuria,
pollacisuria, secretion from urethra, BK virus in urine and john cunningham virus in urine while being treated with 
rituximab (MabThera).
Patient concomitant medications included cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisolone and 
bendamustine (CHOP, 6 cycles). No medical history, concurrent conditions or past drugs were reported.
On 22/Feb/2012, his absolute neutrophil count (ANC) was 2.8 E9/l and white blood cell count (WBC) was 8.4 E9/l. 
On 27/Mar/2012, the patient started therapy with intravenous (IV) rituximab (once in 3 weeks, dose was not 
reported) as maintenance therapy for follicular lymphoma. On 03/Apr/2012, he had gastroenteritis. On 06/Apr/2012,
event gastroenteritis was resolved. On 23/Jun/2012, he developed febrile infection. On 01/Jul/2012, event febrile 
infection was resolved. On 01/Aug/2012, he completed 6 cycles of intravenous rituximab. On 26/Sep/2012, his 
Immunoglobulin G was 5.9 g/l. On 05/Oct/2012, he started intravenous rituximab once in 2 months due to relapse. 
On 25/Jan/2013, he completed 3 cycles of  intravenous rituximab. He was administrated 6 cycles of intravenous 
rituximab with bendamustine due to relapse from 25/Mar/2013 to 05/Aug/2013. He received subsequent 6 cycles of
intravenous rituximab from 03/Oct/2013 to 25/Jul/2014. On (b) (6) he experienced dysuria, pollacisuria and 
secretion from urethra which lead to hospitalization (Signs and symptoms of dysuria, pollacisuria and secretion 
from urethra included urinary tract symptoms, irritated mucosa in urethrocystoscopy and reddish mucosa in 
urethrocystoscopy). On the same day, his urine red blood cells (RBC) and white blood cells (WBC) were positive 
and urine culture was negative. On 26/Sep/2014, he switched to subcutaneous rituximab 1400 mg (once in 2 
months) and received a single dose. On (b) (6)  he went to emergency department. On 27/Nov/2014, therapy
with subcutaneous rituximab was stopped. On 05/Dec/2014, a urethrocystoscopy was performed. It detected an 
irritated and reddish mucosa. In micturition diary 17 urinate times a day was found (amount 20-220 ml a time). On

FOIA Case Report Information
(b) (6)   urine polyoma virus nucleic acid test was performed and the result was found positive and BK virus 
count in his urine was 300000 DNA copies/ml which revealed that, he had BK virus in urine which lead to 
hospitalization. On (b) (6)  in fluid 30 000 copies of DNA in milli litre and in tissue fragment 1600000 copies of
DNA in cm/E3, his urine fungal test was negative and urine tuberculosis culture was unfinished. On (b) (6)
his IgG was 6.6 g/l, immunoglobulin M was 0.16g/l, CD8 count was 0.22 10 E9/l, CD4 count was 0.16 10 E9/l, ANC 
was 2.1 E9/l and WBC 3.3 E9/l. Uracyst lavage of the bladder was started on 30/Dec/2014, the symptom started to 
abate. On 27/Jan/2015, BK virus count in his urine was 3200 DNA copies/ml. On 03/Mar/2015, he experienced john
cunningham virus in urine. On the same day, his BK virus count was 120000 DNA copies/ml and JC (John 
Cunningham) virus count was 200000 DNA copies in urine which revealed that, he had john cunningham virus in 
urine. The symptom was caused by polyomavirus and could be related to immunosuppression caused by rituximab.
He was not totally recovered. The events caused notable harm to the patient. The symptoms had however eased, 
either due to symptomatic treatment or natural aptitude to recover. On an unspecifed date, his immunodeficiency 
was reported as unknown and stated that he had no chronic viral infections, HIV, bone marrow or solid bone 
transplantation, herpes simplex, herpes zoster, history of opportunistic infections, CMV pneumocystic carinii 
pneumonia or known CNS pathology and  reported that a stored serum sample was not available. It was mentioned
that, his brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), brain biopsy or JC virus in cerebrospinal fluid was not performed
and stated that, he was alive. Later, events dysuria, pollacisuria and secretion from urethra was improved.
At the time of the report, outcome of event BK virus in urine was persisiting and outcome of event john cunningham
virus in urine was not reported.
The hematologist did not provide the causal relationship of the events gastroenteritis, febrile infection, dysuria, 
pollacisuria, secretion from urethra, BK virus in urine and john cunningham virus in urine with intravenous rituximab 
and subcutaneous rituximab.
The company assessed events gastroenteritis, febrile infection and john cunningham virus in urine as medically 
significant.
No further information was provided.
