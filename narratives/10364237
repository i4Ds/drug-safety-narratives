Medically Significant
A neurologist reported via TOUCH reauthorization questionnaire that a male patient on TYSABRI (300 mg, IV, QM) 
for Multiple Sclerosis from 25 Jan 2007 to 28 May 2014 experienced PML is under investigation (onset unknown).
At the time of this report, TOUCH dosing database indicated that that the patient had received a total of 92 doses of
TYSABRI infusion from 25 Jan 2007 to 28 May 2014. Treatment for the event was not reported. The patient has 
tested positive for anti JCV antibodies since 30 Jan 2014. The outcome for the event PML is under investigation is 
unknown. The causality for the event of PML is under investigation is unknown.  TYSABRI therapy was 
discontinued.
Update 23 Jul 2014: Upon follow-up, a neuro-radiologist reported that the patient experienced suspected PML 
based on MRI findings. The patient had several MRIs in Jan, Jun, Jul 2014 which were described as progressive

cortical lesions involving multiple lobes of brain which he felt was consistent with PML. The neurologist stated that 
these lesions were atypical for MS. The patient was asymptomatic at the time of this report.  MS was diagnosed in 
2003. Prior medication included Avonex (interferon beta-1a). The patient was positive for anti JCV antibodies and 
negative for anti natalizumab antibodies. Lumbar puncture was done some time after 16 Jun 2014 and was 
negative at (b) (6)  No further information was provided.
Update 27 Jul 2014: The neurologist provided MRI images regarding this 38 year old male patient on TYSABRI for 
5 years and who is suspected for PML with symptoms of imbalance and slight headache. Selected MRI images 
from Jul 2014, Dec 2013, and Jan 2013 scans were provided. 
Update 29 Jul 2014: A healthcare professional (HCP) responded to an outbound request for additional information. 
The patient had one lumbar puncture but the results of JCV testing were not available.  The patient had not been 
hospitalized, received any treatment and was asymptomatic.  The HCP agreed to provide MRI reports and recent 
visit notes.
Update 05 Aug 2014:  The following information was reported via medical records.  Per a note from an office visit 
on 05 Jun 2014, the patient was doing well at that time and had no new issues, with the exception of an injuried 
right middle finger after punching a wall due to being upset with his girlfried. It was also noted that the patient's
balance was off and that he had some tingling in his right hand which fluctuated and worsended with fatigue. The 
patient was continuing to exercise. The patient's anti-JCV antibody titer (date of testing unknown) was 0.65.  The 
patient had no prior exposure to chemotherapy agents.  Concomitant medications included Cialis (tadalafil).  The 
patient's height and weight were reported as 5 feet 10 inches and 161 (units not provided).  The patient was noted 
to have no signs of disease progression with stable walking and good strength. The patient's timed 25-food walk 
was 5.5 seconds.  A MRI perfomred in Dec 2013 was stable. An MRI from 16 Jun 2014 showed multifocal non-
enhancing white matter disease and two progressive lesions (compared to Dec 2013) located in left precentral 
gyrus and left posterior inferior occipital lobe.  The patient was seen again on 19 Jun 2014 for re-evaluation after 
the abnormal MRI on 16 Jun 2014.  The patient did not report any new symptoms.  A lumbar puncture (LP) was 
done on 19 Jun 2014 and the cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) was negative for JCV DNA per local lab (lower level of 
detection unknown). Anti-natalizumab antibody test from 16 Jun 2014 was also negative.
Update 13 Aug 2014:  The neurologist provided the following additional information.  The patient refused an 
additional lumbar puncture. The patient's clinical status was reported as stable.  Treatment included pulsed steroids
(NOS) every 2 weeks, and a repeat MRI will be performed. TYSABRl therapy was discontinued.
Update 19 Aug 2014:  The neurologist provided the following additional information.  The patient's MRI from Jul 
2014 was done on 11 Jul 2014 and showed left precentral gyral lesion with FLAIR hyperintensity with central

malacia associated with medial margin of restricted diffusion, additional areas of cortical/ subcortical ill-defined 
hyperintensity were present in the left inferior frontal lobe, left post-central gyrus, left occipital lobe, with additional 
small lesion in the inferior right occipital lobe, restricted diffusion likely present along the left and right occipital 
cortical lesions, unchanged compared to MRI from 06 Jun 2014; multiple additional cortical/ subcortical lesions, 
concerning for indolent PML.
Update 28 Aug 2014:  The neurologist provided the following additional information.  At the time of this report the 
patient was hospitalized.  A lumbar puncture was done on 28 Aug 2014 and the CSF sample will be sent to (b) (6)  
(lower level of detection 10 copies/ mL) and (b) (6)  (lower level of detection 50 copies/ mL) for JCV 
DNA testing.
Update 02 Sep 2014:  The neurologist provided the following additional information. An MRI from 07 Jan 2013 
(compared to MR from 03 May 2012) showed multiple parenchymal white matter demyelinating plaques that were 
stable without development of new lesions.  Plaques were present within the corpus callosum along the callosal 
septal interface and brainstem.  Many of the plaques were associated with black hole formation, the largest within 
the left centrum semiovale and right middle cerebellar peduncle.  None of the plaques were associated with 
enhancement.
Update 04 and 05 Sep 2014:  The neurologist provided the following additional information.  The patient's CSF was 
positive for JCV DNA at 54 copies/mL per the (b) (6)  labs.  The patient discontinued TYSABRl "2 months ago" and 
has not received plasma exchange (PLEX).  At the time of this report the patient was "in low grade IRIS [immune 
reconstitution inflammatory syndrome]".  Treatment for IRIS included steroids (NOS).
Update 09 Sep 2014:  Biogen Idec considers this case to be confirmed for PML based on positive CSF, positive 
MRI, and clinical symptoms.
Update 28 Apr 2015: Additional information was received from the neurologist via a Standardized MS PML Data 
Collection Tool. At the time of the neurologist completing this report, 23 Apr 2015, the patient is alive, residing at 
home and had estimated Karnofsky score of 80 (normal activity with effort; some signs or symptoms of disease). 
The patient was diagnosed with IRIS which was determined by MRI findings and clinical symptoms (onsets not 
provided): motor (focal) right upper extremity weaker, visual (blurring of vision, resolved), and other - fatigue. The 
patient did not receive corticosteroids pre-IRIS. Post - IRIS onset, the patient received corticosteroid treatment: 
Solumedrol (methylprednisolone) 1 gram, IV, daily for 28 days total. The patient is currently on therapy for Multiple 
Sclerosis for clinical relapse and as a preventative which includes IVIG since 31 Mar 2015 (for five scheduled 
doses) and Plegridy (peginterferon beta-1a) since Apr 2015. The most recent brain MRI, on 08 Apr 2015, showed: 
multifocal non-enhancing white matter disease representing multiple sclerosis with resolved enhancement since 12

Mar 2015 without new lesion. Three areas of presumed chronic IRIS / post-IRIS malacia with mild increased white 
matter hyperintensity in left occipital and postcentral areas since 12 Mar 2015 which may represent mild 
progression of gliosis. It was noted that steroid use may attenuate lesion enhancement and therefore, continued 
follow up was recommended. The event of PML has resolved as of MRI findings in Mar 2015 and the outcome of 
event of IRIS is resolved as of 01 Apr 2015. Causality for the events of PML and IRIS was assessed as related to 
TYSABRI.
