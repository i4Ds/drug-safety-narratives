Medically Significant
A medical doctor reported, via a dissertation: Grosset-Janin C. A retrospective study of 13 patients who developed 
progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy under natalizumab: clinical and radiological, that a 52 year old female 
patient on TYSABRI (300 mg, IV, QM) for Multiple Sclerosis from unknown date to unknown date experienced PML
suspicion (onset unknown).  The dissertation was presented at University of Toulouse, France, on 02 Oct 2014. 
The author presented 13 cases of PML from two university hospitals. The diagnosis of PML was made or 
suspected between Dec 2009 and Jun 2014. Patient information was collected from medical records that were 
reviewed retrospectively from the hospital databases. The article reported that the female patient (b)(6)  was diagnosed
with multiple sclerosis in 1994 at the age of 36. The neurologist assessed the event of PML as possible. JCV PCR 
in CSF result was negative (tested in a US lab). At the time of PML diagnosis, the patient was 52 year old and MS 
was evolving for 16 years. TYSABRI was started 13 years after MS was diagnosed and was ongoing at the time of 
PML diagnosis. The patient had received 33 infusions. JCV serology was positive. The patient had not received any
immunosuppressive agent before TYSABRI and had 2 risk factors for the event. The outcome for the event PML

suspicion is unknown. The causality for the event of PML suspicion was assessed as possibly related.  It is 
unknown if TYSABRI treatment is ongoing. French Imputability: C2S2I2
Update 17 Nov 2014: The physician spontaneously reported that this case has not been notified as the PML has 
not been confirmed due to negative JCV PCR testing. French imputability: C1 S1 I1
Update 01 Feb 2015: Follow-up information received from the neurologist reported the patient's initials as(b) (6)  and 
provided date of birth. French Imputability: C1S1I1
Update 24 Feb 2015: Additional information received indicated the patient was enrolled in (b) (6)
(b) (6)  Natalizumab safety registry in rest of world. No further information was provided.
Update 22 Jul 2015: Follow-up information was received from the prescribing/treating neurologist via a suspect 
PML Data Collection Form. The patient first experienced first signs of MS in 1994 and was diagnosed on 08 Sep 
2004. MS symptoms included motor/focal (weakness of the right arm), sensory (lower limb paresthesia) and 
vesico-sphincter disorders. The suspect product was confirmed as TYSABRI (300 mg, IV, QM) which was started 
on 14 Aug 2007 and stopped on 20 Apr 2010 due to the current PML suspicion. The patient did not experience any 
interruption of TYSABRI for greater than three months. The patient had received no prior immunosuppressant or 
immunomodulatory therapies. Serum anti-JCV antibody status was positive on 06 Jun 2011 ((b) (6) ). The patient 
was evaluated for PML due to presenting with suggestive clinical signs and symptoms, which also prompted MRI 
which revealed suspicious findings. Clinical signs and symptoms included cognitive/behavioral (attention disorder) 
with onset in May 2010, motor (discrete motor deficit of the right hemibody) with onset in Jun 2010, cerebellar 
(ataxia) with onset in May 2010, sensory (plurimodal hypoesthesia of the right hemibody) with onset in Jun 2010 
and right peripheral facial paralysis with onset in May 2010.  At the time of PML suspicion, on 18 May 2010, the 
following laboratory results were reported: absolute leukocyte count 8.10 g/l (reference range 4.3-10), absolute 
lymphocyte count 3.69 g/l (reference range 1.5-4.0), and on 10 Jun 2010, leukocytes were 8.19 g/l and lymphocytes
were 2.84 g/l. MRI at the time of PML suspicion was performed on 10 Jun 2010 and showed left occipital lesion 
inflammatory-like with radiological activity sign; no typical image suggestive of PML.. Lumbar puncture was 
performed on 11 Jun 2010 and tested negative (CSF JCV DNA) at both United States laboratory and at a 
(presumed) local laboratory. CSF analysis showed <2 cells (NOS), glucose 3.5 mmol/l, protein 0.31 g/l, and PCR 
for HSV, enterovirus, CMV and EBV all negative. Brain biopsy has not been performed. PML treatment included 
Solumedrol (methylprednisolone) 1g/day during 3 days from 30 Jun 2010 to 02 Jul 2010. The patient did not receive
plasmatic exchanges or other treatments different from drugs. Since cessation of TYSABRI, the patient received 
MS disease therapy including Copaxone (glatiramer acetate; SC, QD) from 10 Mar 2011 to 25 Apr 2011 and 
Tecfidera (dimethyl fumarate; BID) since 03 Apr 2014. The neurologist stated that the patient has never been 
enrolled neither in a Biogen nor a non-Biogen study. The patient's current location was home. Based on the

reporter's evaluation PML has not been confirmed; PCR [CSF JCV DNA] was negative but MRI was compatible. 
French Imputability: C1S1I1
Update 23 Jul 2015: Biogen considers this case downgraded from high suspect for PML to low suspect for PML 
pending confirmation of PML being excluded by the physician.
