A registered nurse spontaneously reported that a 53 year old male patient on TYSABRI (300 mg, IV, QM) for 
Multiple Sclerosis from 17 Oct 2008 to 12 Sep 2014 was hospitalized from (b) (6)  to an unknown date for 
suspect PML (Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy, onset 13 Mar 2015). The patient was diagnosed with 
Multiple Sclerosis (MS) on 06 Jun 2002. Prior therapies included Copaxone (glatiramer acetate) from 2005 to Sep 
2008. The patient was treated with Gilenya (Fingolimod) for Multiple Sclerosis from 06 Nov 2014 to 16 Mar 2015. 
On 15 Aug 2013, laboratory testing included JCV antibody index: 3.4, on 28 Feb 2014, the patient was tested 
positive for JCV antibody with index value of 3.669; on 15 Aug 2014, an MRI was performed that showed 2 new 
lesions suspect for progression of disease; an MRI on 24 Dec 2014 showed at least 2 known puntiforme lesions 
center semi-oval left increased in volume, and one more larger new lesion frontal left, without classical PML image, 
and it was concluded to be evolving disease; an MRI performed on 13 Mar 2015 that showed on right side larger

increase on the multiple white lesion, anterior frontal and also left fronto-basal. With contrast almost all lesions were
hyperintensive, and it was concluded that although not characteristic for PML, PML could not be ruled out, but could
also be worsening of MS. A lumbar puncture was scheduled for (b) (6)   The event of suspect PML is 
ongoing and the causality was unknown. The patient also experienced progression of Multiple Sclerosis by MRI 
(onset 15 Aug 2014); clinical symptoms included worsened gait (onset unknown), and sensitive for pain (onset 
unknown).  The events are ongoing and the causality was unknown. TYSABRI therapy was discontinued.
Update 17 Mar 2015: Upon follow-up, the nurse spontaneously reported that the MRI performed on 13 Mar 2015 
was reviewed by the VU medical center and they provided an opinion that it was indicative of PML, in IRIS (Immune
Reconstitution Inflammatory Syndrome) phase already. The lumbar puncture has been performed on (b) (6)
and serum and liquor would be sent to (b) (6) , results are pending.
Update 20 Mar 2015: Upon follow-up, the nurse spontaneously reported that the patient's CSF sample taken on (b)(6)  
(b) (6)  resulted positive for JCV DNA and showed JCV DNA (PCR)=34 copies/ml as measured in (b) (6)
Update 26 Mar 2015: Upon internal review, Biogen considers this case to be a confirmed case of PML based on 
positive CSF, consistent MRI findings, and clinical symptoms.
Update 26 Mar 2015:Upon follow-up, the nurse spontaneously reported that the patient's JC Virus DNA test at 
(b) (6)  detected 83 copies/mL JCV DNA (presumed for sample taken on (b) (6) ).
Update 30 Oct 2015: Additional information was received from a registered nurse via a MS Standardized PML Data
Collection Tool and diagnostic tests. The patient is alive and living at home. Recently started on fingolimod again, 
after increase in demyelinating enhancing lesions. The patient experienced problems of urinary incontinence which 
has resolved after restart of fingolimod; mobility on old level. Test results post- PML include: 03 Mar 2015 - IgG of 
6.7 g/l (normal range 7.0 - 16.0), IgG quotient of 0.0029 (normal range <0.0028); 25 Mar 2015 - glucose POCT of 
10.4 (normal range 4.0 - 6.4); 05 Apr 2015 - phosphate of 0.3 mmol/l (normal range 0.8 - 1.5), GGT of 123 U/l 
(normal range <55); ALAT of 49 U/l (normal range <45), leukocytes of 16.0 10x^9/l (normal range 4.0 - 10.0), 
platelet of 137 x10^9/l (normal range 150-400), neutrophil granulocyte of 89.9 % (normal 40.0 - 80.0), lymphocyte of
3.3 % (normal range 20.0 - 40.0), eosinophils  granulocytes 0.8 % (normal range 1.0-6.0), neutrophil granulocyte 
absolute of 14.37 x10^9/l (normal range 2.0 - 7.0), absolute lymphocyte of 0.53 x10^9/l (normal range 1.0 - 3.0).  An
MRI was performed on 02 Apr 2015 and results were not provided. Test results from 10 Apr 2015 include: 
leukocyte count of 7.4 (normal range 4.0 - 10.0), lymphocyte count of 10.3 (normal range 20.0 - 40.0), absolute 
lymphocyte count of 0.76 (normal range 1.0 - 3.0). An MRI was performed on 12 May 2015 and results were not 
provided. Test results from 02 Jun 2015 include: urea of 3.3 mmol/l (normal range 3.5 - 7.5), GGT of 62 U/l (normal
range <55), leukocyte of 9.8 x10^9/l (normal range 4.0 - 10.0), absolute lymphocyte of 3.42 x10^9/l (normal range

1.0 - 3.0), total eosinophil of 0.56 x10^9/l (range of 0.02 - 0.50). 
A cranial MRI was performed on 16 Jun 2015 with the following results: Examination according to MS protocol 
before and after administration of Gadolineum contrast IV. Supratentorial  both sides peri ventricular via the centre 
semi-oval both sides to subcortical and also juxtacortical both sides to supratentorial, mainly juxtacortical at the 
level of the insula area on the right side, in the white matter, confluent hyperintense white matter lesions on T2 and 
FLAIR are visible. Known same sort structures in the corpus callosum visible, also same on the right side near the 
mesencephalon and pons and also on the right side of the cerebellum are visible. On the T1 weight images before 
Gd administration, no evident white matter lesions with black hole aspect visible, known spontaneous hyperintense 
aspect near the insula area on the right side with known enhancing structures, no new pathological enhancing 
structures visible. No indication for diffusion restriction supra or infratentorial. Known aspect of venous angioma. 
No indication for mass working, no shift of median line. Known broad aspect of ventricular system and also aspect 
of megacisterna magna. Also mucus swelling in right sinus maxillaris visible. Conclusion: compared to scan of 12 
May 2015 and 02 Apr 2015, unchanged image confirm MS and PML disease, without signs of increase of 
demyelination or disease activity. Test results from 23 Jun 2015 include: glucose POCT of 7.0 mmol/l (normal 
range 4.0 - 6.4); 20 Jul 2015 - lymphocyte of 16.9 % (normal range 20.0 - 40.0), monocyte of 10.5 % (2.0 - 10.0), 
absolute lymphocyte of 1.40 x10^9/l. A cranial MRI was performed on 04 Aug 2015 with the following results: subtle
decrease of pathological enhancements in deep gray matter with a partial perivascular distribution pattern. No sign 
of new pathological enhancing lesions. Conclusion: decrease in inflammatory disease activity, in particular in the 
edge-region of the PML lesion. A cranial MRI was performed on 16 Oct 2015 with the following results: imaging is 
similar to imaging in May / Jun with no new findings. As of 20 Oct 2015, the patient's estimated Karnofsky score 
was 90 (able to carry on normal activity; minor signs or symptoms of disease).; EDSS was not done. Test results 
from 22 Oct 2015 include: urea of 2.5 mmol/l (normal range 3.5 - 7.5), potassium of 4.7 mmol/l (normal range 3.2 - 
4.5), GGT of 163 U/l (normal range <55), ALAT of 98 U/l (normal range <45), ASAT of 43 U/l (normal range <35), 
hematocrit of 0.5 l/l (normal range 0.40 - 0.50), erythrocyte of 5.69 x10^12/l (normal range 4.50 -5.50), neutrophil 
granulocyte of 70.6 % (normal range 40.0 - 80.0), lymphocyte of 12.8 % (normal range 20.0 - 40.0), absolute 
lymphocyte of 1.04 x10^9/l, eosinophils  granulocytes 8.3 % (normal range 1.0-6.0), total eosinophil of 0.67 x10^9/l 
(range of 0.02 - 0.50).  The neurologist noted the patient has not been diagnosed with IRIS (discrepant from 
previous report). The patient has not received corticosteroids pre-IRIS or post-IRIS. Treatment for PML / IRIS 
included mefloquine (250 mg, PO, one day per week) from 23 Mar 2015 to 07 Aug 2015 and mirtazapine (300 mg, 
PO, BID) from 23 Mar 2015 to 07 Aug 2015. As of this report the patient was assessed as recovered for event of 
PML. The causality of the event of PML was assessed as related to TYSABRI.
