Medically Significant
A neurologist reported that a 26 year old male patient on TYSABRI (300 mg, IV, QM) for Multiple Sclerosis from 12 
Aug 2010 to 14 Apr 2014 experienced PML suspicion (onset unknown).  The patient had no prior 
immunosuppressive therapy.  Previous MRI was performed on 02 Oct 2013, results not provided.  MRI performed 
on 13 Mar 2014 showed very small pons T2 lesion, non-Gadolinium enhancing.  MRI performed on 09 May 2014 
showed slight enlargement of pons lesion, Gadolinium ehnacing. On 27 May 2014, anti-JCV antibody testing was 
performed as part of the (b) (6)  study.  Results were positive with an index value of 3.047.  MRI performed on 
08 Jul 2014 showed new T2 lesions in pons, left cerebellar peduncle, cerebellum (small size, all Gadolinium 
enhancing),  enlargement of pons lesion; all lesions were considered PML suspect. Lumbar puncture was 
performed on 09 Jul 2014 and results are pending. The event of PML suspicion is ongoing. The causality for the 
event of PML suspicion was assessed as related.  TYSABRI therapy was discontinued. French Imputability: C2S2I2

FOIA Case Report Information
Update 23 Jul 2014: Additional information was received from the neurologist. The patient's MS was diagnosed on 
24 May 2010. TYSABRI was discontinued because of JCV seropositivity with repeated high index values (>>1.5). 
The patient was intermittently hospitalized for corticosteroids infusions and clinical/MRI follow-up. Prompt PML 
evalution was determinated based on the following symptoms: transient diplopia in Mar 2014 and cerebellar 
syndrome in Jul 2014. No specific MS therapy post TYSABRI (only corticosteroid) was given. JCV ultraSensitive 
PCR ((b) (6) ) positive with 80 copies/mL. So the diagnosis was confirmed, the patient experienced immune 
reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (onset unknown). The patient was switched to Gylenia (fingolimod, dates 
unk). MRI, performed in Mar 2014, revealed a lesion of posterior fossa. Causlaity for IRIS was not reported.  Event 
outcomes were not reported. French Imputabilty: C2S2I2.
Update 07 Aug 2014: On internal review, Biogen Idec considers this case to be confirmed for PML.
Update 08 Oct 2014: Additional information was received from a different neurologist via a Biogen Idec employee. 
The patient's last TYSABRI infusion (48th or 49th infusion) was administered on 17 Mar 2014. The patient had no 
immunosuppressive treatment prior to TYSABRI.  Prior to TYSABRI, EDSS was 5. When TYSABRI was stopped, 
EDSS was 2. [JCV] index values (date unknown) were between 2.9 and 3.1. TYSABRI was stopped due to 
increased risk of PML. One month after TYSABRI was stopped, the patient received Gilenya (fingolimod) for 2 
months. No further information was reported. French Imputability: C2S2I2
Update 11 Mar 2015: Additional information was received from the neurologist via a MS Standardized PML Data 
Collection Tool. The patient is alive, residing at home, and is not currently on any MS therapy. Karnofsky and EDSS
scores on 19 Jan 2015 were 60 (requires occasional assistance, but is able to care for most of his personal needs) 
and 4.0. A brain MRI was performed on 19 Jan 2015 (results not provided). Test results post-PML were reported as
follows: leukocyte count 7690 x 10(6)/L (normal range 4.0 - 10 x10(9)L); lymphocyte count 2200 x 10(6)/L (normal 
range 1.5 - 4.0 x10(9)L); absolute lymphocyte count 2200 x 10(6)/L (normal range 1.5 - 4.0 x10(9)L). The patient 
was diagnosed with IRIS, which was determined by clinical symptoms and MRI findings. IRIS symptoms included 
memory and attention disorders (cognitive/ behavioral; onset date 24 May 2014); diplopia (visual; onset date 24 
May 2014); ataxia and tremor (cerebellar; onset dates 24 May 2014 and Oct 2014, respectively); and left 
hypoesthesia (sensory-focal; onset date 23 Jun 2014). The patient did not receive corticosteroids pre-IRIS onset. 
The patient received corticosteroids post-IRIS onset and included methylprednisolone 1 GM daily from 09 Jun 2014
to 11 Jun 2014, methylprednisolone 1 GM daily from 23 Jul 2014 to 25 Jul 2014, and prednisone taper as follows: 
80 mg daily 26 Jul 2014 to 28 Jul 2014; 60 mg daily 28 Jul 2014 to 04 Aug 2014; 40 mg daily 04 Aug 2014 to 11 
Aug 2014; 20 mg daily 11 Aug 2014 to 18 Aug 2014; 30 mg daily 18 Aug 2014 to 08 Sep 2014; 20 mg daily 08 Sep 
2014 to 09 Oct 2014; 10 mg daily 09 Oct 2014 to 10 Nov 2014; 5 mg daily 10 Nov 2014 to 09 Dec 2014; 4 mg daily 
09 Dec 2014 to 23 Dec 2014; and 3 mg daily 23 Dec 2014 to 19 Jan 2015. As of 19 Jan 2015, the patient has not 
recovered from PML and has not recovered from IRIS. Causality of the events of PML and IRIS was assessed as

Update 09 Sep 2015: A report was received from literature.  Hodel J, Outteryck O, Verclytte S, Deramecourt V, 
Lacour A, Pruvo J-P, Vermersch P, and Leclerc X.  Brain magnetic susceptibility changes in patients with 
natalizumab-associated progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy.  American Journal of Neuroradiology; 27 Aug 
2015.  doi: 10.3174/ajnr.A4436.  This case is in reference to patient number 11, a 26 year old male patient.  The 
patient was exposed to TYSABRI for a total of 48 months.  On an unknown date, the patient's cerebrospinal fluid 
(CSF) was positive for JCV DNA.  The patient had 9 available MRIs (dates and results not reported), covering the 
"presymptomatic to chronic stage".  The patient did have susceptibility weighted imaging.  The patient also had T2 
weighted imaging.  The subject had one PML lesion located in the left MCP and adjacent to basal ganglia.  For the 
lesion located in the left MCP, there was low-signal in the deep gray matter, specifically the left dentate nucleus. 
The time of detection of the susceptibility-weighted signal abnormality was noted as " presymptomatic and after ". 
The subject also had a PML lesion located in the right frontal lobe which was not adjacent to the basal ganglia. For 
the second lesion, there was low-signal intensity within the U-fibers and there was no low-signal in the deep gray 
matter. The time of detection of the susceptibility-weighted signal abnormality was noted as "chronic ". At the 
symptomatic stage, the NTZ-PML lesion appeared hyperintense on the FLAIR image involving the right precentral 
gyrus. The SWI sequence revealed a hypointense rim involving the U-fibers adjacent to the PML lesion. 
Asymmetric T2 hypointensity within the basal ganglia was systematically observed when PML was adjacent to the 
deep gray matter at any stage, including the presymptomatic stage for patient 11.
