This clinical trial case concerns a 62 year old Caucasian male 
patient. 
The patient's medical history included pulmonary fibrosis (interstitial pneumopathy) since 2001 without etiology 
found which remained asymptomatic, left upper lobe bronchial adenocarcinoma T2N3M0 for which patient 
underwent radiation therapy and concomitant chemotherapy. Prior to the trial, the patient did not have 
chemotherapy treatments with bleomycin, busulfan, carmustine, cyclophosphamide, docetaxel, irinotecan, 
methotrexate, paclitaxel or vinorelbine. No concomitant medications were reported. 
On 29-Aug-2011 the patient first received pemetrexed 500mg/m2 intravenously on days one, 22 and 43 in 
combination with radiotherapy 66Gy (30 x 2 Gy) for the treatment of stage III non-small cell lung cancer. It was 
reported that the last dose of radiotherapy in the concurrent phase was administered on 07-Oct-2011 and the last 
dose of pemetrexed was administered on 12-Oct-2011. It was reported that the patient did not receive cisplatin 
therapy (to be clarified). On 16-Nov-2011 the patient commenced the consolidation phase with pemetrexed 
(500mg/m2 intravenously on day one, 22, 43 and 64). The most recent dose prior to event onset was on 18-Jan-
2012. From unknown date in early Feb-2012, the patient had presented with dyspnea aggravation during his daily 
activities. On 15-Feb-2012, approximately 29 days after last dose of pemetrexed in the consolidation phase and 
approximately four months since last dose of concurrent phase pemetrexed and radiotherapy, the patient 
experienced pneumonitis grade II which was reported as serious for other reasons of dyspnea. Thoracic scan 
performed on 15-Feb-2012 showed bilateral infiltrate upper lobe. Laboratory work undertaken on 22-Feb-2012 
included: leukocytes 19 x10ex3/m1 (<10x10ex3/m1), erythrocytes 11x10ex3/m1 (<10x10ex3/m1), lactate 
dehydrogenase (LDH) 7121U/I (240-480), C-reactive protein (CRP) 142.8 mg/I (<5.0), albumin 28.2 g/I (35.0-52.0), 
hemoglobin 10.4 g/dl (13.0-17.0), hematocrit 29.3% (40,0-50.0), platelets 449 g/I (150-400), neutrophils 8.42 g/I 
(1.50-7.00) and lymphocytes 0.79 g/I (1.50-4.00). On the same day, electrolytes, glucose, urea, creatinine, bilirubin, 
aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase and gamma glutamyltransferase were all within 
normal ranges. On the same day, aerobic and anaerobic blood culture were sterile, bronchoalveolar lavage was 
positive for rare yeast and a thoracic x-ray revealed bilateral parenchymatous progression with reticulo-nodular 
syndrome including all pulmonary areas - prob  e atelectasis phenomenon of right upper lung lobe. The patient 
was hospitalized first time in the unit from as the event of pneurnonitis was persisting and also for 
acute respiratory distress with major hypoxemia requiring oxygen therapy with Optiflow associated with 
corticosteroid 1mg/kg and antibiotics with cefotaxime sodium and levofloxacine hemihydrate. Bronchoalveolar 
lavage was sterile and no argument in favour of articular etiology. Bronchial spur biopsy showed no argument in 
favour to carcinomatosis lymphangitis. On , hemoglobin was 11.2 g/dl, hematocrit 33.0%, partial 
carbon dioxide (paCO2) 34.1 mmHg (35.0- . , pa is oxygen (paO2) 40.2 mmHg (80.0 -100.0, oxygen saturation 
77.3% (95-98) pH 7.497 (no units, 7.350 -7.450), temperature 36.7 degrees Celsius (normal range unknown), and 
electrolytes were within normal ranges. On anatomy and physiological cytology results revealed left

spur B1 B2 left (bronchial) but biopsy did not show tumoral recurrence of bronchial biopsies nor neoplastic 
lymphangitis -metasplasia without arguments of dysplasia. Ong patient was retransfered to the unit for 
acute respiratory distress. On the same day, the patient was hospitalized for diffuse interstitial pneumopathy 
(severe interstitial pneumonia) which was not considered a new event but the outcome of the final diagnosis of 
pneumonitis. Glasgow score was 15, temperature 37.3 degrees Celsius, blood pressure 131/90 mmHg (normal 
range unknown) and heart rate 117bpm (normal ranges unknown). Pulmonary auscultation showed vesicular 
murmur with bilateral basal crepitation, no hypercapnia, cardiac auscultation, heart sounds were without murmur 
and the rest of the examination was without abnormality. In addition, partial carbon dioxide (PCO2) was 32 mmHg, 
partial oxygen (P02) 76 mmHg, blood lactate 2.4 mmo1/1 and bicarbonate was within normal ranges. Thoracic x-ray 
showed alveolar interstitial opacities, hyperleukocytosis with 15800/mm3 (normal range unknown), urea 0.32 g/I 
(<0.50), creatinine 6 mg/I (7.0-12.0), hyponatremia 129 mmo1/1 (136-145), and the rest of the work-up was normal. 
As corrective treatment, the patient received oxygen therapy with Optiflow at 100% antibiotics with piperacillin 
sodium/tazobactam sodium, amikacin, cefotaxime sodium, and levofloxacin hemihydrate. In addition, the patient 
received corticosteroid therapy, acetylcysteine, kinesitherapy, non-invasive ventilation and aerosol. Respiratory 
status worsened and non-invasive ventilation sessions were poorly tolerated. Due to the respiratory status 
aggravation, patient was intubated and ventilated on 1111111.1.111 However, despite the ventilation measure and 
curarization, patient had hypercapnic major respiratory acidosis with a pH of 7.2 and PCO2 of 80 mmHg and 
underwent additional oxygen therapy. The patient was hemodynamically instable with sedation and mechanical 
ventilation and introduction of low doses of epinephrine. It was also reported that the patient did not receive 
mechanical ventilation and only a non-invasive ventilation was performed. The patient was reported to have died on 
probably due to severe interstitial pneumonia. It was reported that despite the efficacy of steroids and 
antibiotics, the event has led to death of patient. The investigator reported that the final diagnoses and cause of 
death were due to lung injury radiation and chemotherapy pneumonitis. It was concluded in the hospital discharge 
summary that interstitial pneumopathy progression was responsible for refractory respiratory distress with outcome 
defavourable leading to patient's death. There was no autopsy report. 
In the opinion of the investigator the fatal event of pneumonitis was related to pemetrexed (in the concurrent and 
consolidation phase) and radiotherapy and unrelated to protocol procedures. The investigator further added that 
death is related to treatment (radiation therapy and chemotherapy).
