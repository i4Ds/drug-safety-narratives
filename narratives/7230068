This clinical trial case concerns a 62 year old Caucasian male patient. Medical history included 
metastatic king carcinoma with known liver metastases (initial diagnosis Aug09), arteriosclerotic cardiovascular 
disease, hypertension, hypokalemia, hye  0  gnesemia hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, anemia and is status 
post bronchoscopy and stent placement. FromOMIntoillilla the patient was hospitalized and received 
radiation therapy to right lung for pneumonitis. There's history of occasional alcohol use and.intermittent tobacco 
use. The aeceived multiple concomitant medications, including a multivitamin for supplementation. On 
30Sep09, the patient first received treatment with intravenous (IV) pemetrexed (Alimta) 835 mg, in combination with 
IV cetuximab 670 mg and IV carboplatin 420 mg for the indication of metastatic lung cancer. These were the only 
doses received prior to the event. On 41111111.1111days since initiating study drugs, the patient presented to the 
emergency department with intractable nausea and vomiting, dehydration and dyspnea, all grade 3 and was 
admitted for evaluation. Study drugs were being held. It was noted the he had persistent nausea and vomiting the 
several days prior to admission, along with severe fatigue and weakness present since after the first week of 
treatment. Corrective treatment included IV normal saline for rehydration and metoclopromicle, a, 0. etron and 
pantoprazole for the vomiting. Labs on admission included sodium 127, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) 38, creatinine 
Cr) 2.4, platelet countifia000, white blood count (WBC) 1300, hematocrit (lid) 35.5. Trot* . I level on 
was 0.27, on was 0.28. Electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm with prolonged QT 
interval 440. Chest x-ray revealed previously documented right lung mass with no significant changes from prior 
scans. Ventilation-perfusion king scan showed significant air trapping consistent with chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease (COP0), but low probability for pulmonary embolus. On computed tomography (CT) 
scan of pelvis and abdomen showed widespread metastatic disease of the liver, unremarkable kidneys aside from 
renal mar calcification. Labs on sodium 133, Cr 2.0, BUN 38, amylase was 143, lipase 42.1.1314 
2899, Urine culture done on allalivas negative. A differential diagnosis of pancreatitis was made (it was noted 
that the pancreatitis, renal insufficienc h atremia and bacteremia were not considered serious adverse events 
for reporting per investigator-63in the events were considered resolved and the patient was discharged to 
home in stable condition on On 210ct09, cetuximab, pemetrexed and carboplatin were resumed, events 
did not reappear. In the  0 s  a  of the investigator, dehydration was considered probably related to pemetrexed 
and carboplatin, unrelated to cetuximab; dyspnea considered not likely related to pemetrexed, cetuximab and 
a a a  7  ; intractable nausea and vomiting considered probably related to pemetrexed and carboplatin, possibly 
related to cetuximab. Relatedness assessment for protocol procedure was not provided. Update 23Oct09:
