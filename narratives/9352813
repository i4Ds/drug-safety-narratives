The primary neurologist spontaneously reported that a 49 year old female patient on TYSABRI (300 mg, IV, QM) for
Multiple Sclerosis from 13 Nov 2009 to 09 May 2013 is currently hospitalized at an academic medical center for 
likely progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (onset 2013). The patient was diagnosed with MS in Sep 2001.
Previous MS therapy includes Rebif (interferon beta-1a) from Feb 2008 to Jun 2009.  The patient's JCV antibody 
status is unknown and the patient is enrolled in (b) (6)  At the time of this report the TOUCH database indicated 
that the patient received a total of 45 doses of TYSABRI from 13 Nov 2009 to 09 May 2013. The event of likely 
progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy is ongoing. The causality for the event of likely progressive multifocal 
leukoencephalopathy is unknown.  TYSABRI therapy was discontinued.
Update 07 Jun 2013: The same neurologist clarified that the female patient has tested serum JCV antibody 
positive. Clinical symptoms of PML include ataxia, dysarthria, and minor cognitive changes; her EDSS remains 
stable at 0-1. Her brain MRI is described as having multilobar lesions: bilateral cerebellar with a granular 
appearance, bilateral thalamic lesions (new in Apr 2013), and nodular frontal lobe lesions. She is currently under

the care of another neurologist at an academic medical center. The event is ongoing; causality was not provided.
Update 10 Jun 2013: The treating neurologist reported that the patient symptoms began with dysarthria and 
numbness in the lips (onset Mar 2013) which progressed to difficulty with balance, numbness of the extremities, 
and cognitive issues. CSF JCV PCR is pending; treating includes 5 days of PLEX, Maraviroc, Neupogen 
(filgrastim), and Remeron (mirtazapine). Additional information is expected.
Update 11 Jun 2013:  The primary neurologist provided the following information via medical records, which 
includes MRI and lab reports. Serum anti-JCV antibody testing returned positive on 20 May 2013. Serial CD counts 
were provided for the following dates: 16 Jan 2013, 10 Apr 2013, and 20 May 2013. CD4 count on 16 Jan 2013 was
2278; on 10 Apr 2013 CD3 was 3795, CD4 was 2597, and CD8 was 1183, on 20 May 2013 CD3 was 3339, CD4 
was 2276, and CD8 was 983. Brain MRI reports were provided for the following dates: 18 Oct 2011, 22 Apr 2012, 
11 Dec 2012, and 16 Apr 2013. The impressions are as follows: 18 Oct 2011 MRI impression noted since prior 
study of 01 Apr 2011 there was no significant interval change in the radiographic presentation of a moderate 
supratentorial involvement, and no abnormal enhancement to suggest active areas of demyelination; 22 Apr 2012 
MRI impression noted stable mild periventricular subcortical white matter T2/ FLAIR signal abnormalities in a 
pattern consistent with MS, no abnormal enhancement or definite corpus callosum involvement was noted; 11 Dec 
2012 MRI impression noted an interval progression of demyelinating disease with multiple new supratentorial 
punctate periventricular and subcortical white matter lesions which demonstrated areas of nodular and punctate 
enhancement. 16 Apr 2013 MRI impression noted that compared to the last study, a continuing interval progression
of demyelinating  disease with multiple new supratentorial & infratentorial white matter plaques including dominant 
plaques bilaterally within the thalami (right greater than left). The new plaques demonstrated no definite 
enhancement however there was a persistent bilateral linear & nodular enhancement related to previously 
described plaques. On 06 May 2013 a cervical spine MRI showed grade 1 retrolisthesis of C5 on C6, degenerative 
change identified worst at the C5/6 levels, normal cord signal, and scattered Tornwaldt cysts identified.  No further 
information was provided.
Update 17 Jun 2013: CSF JCV PCR results reported 390 copies from (b) (6)  No further information was provided.
Biogen Idec considers this case to be confirmed for PML based on the clinical presentation, MRI findings, and 
positive CSF.
Update 05 Jul 2013: The neurologist reported via email that no additional lumbar punctures have been performed 
sin Jun 2013. The patient is having weekly MRI s, the most recent MRI of the brain done on 05 Jul 2013 revealed 
multiple foci of signal abnormality with punctuate/nodular enhancement involving the supratentorial and 
infrantentorial white matter, most suggestive of IRIS-PML. Some of these demonstrate minimally decreased 
enhancement compared to study of 27 Jun 2013. No new lesions were noted. Stable multiple white matter lesions, 
some which are indeterminate (and likely related to PML) and others more classic of demyelinating disease. The

neurologist reported clinical and radiological evidence of mild IRIS presenting as mild nodular enhancement in the 
CBL and R occipital lobe. The patient is doing worse clinically with worsening dysarthria, ataxia, difficulty swallowing
and walking. Treatment to help mitigate the IRIS includes Maraviroc and IVIG. At the time of this report, the 
neurologist assessed the patient's estimated EDSS to be 6. The patient is residing at home and is not currently on 
MS therapy (with the exception of IVIG).
Update 06 Dec 2013: Additional information was received from the neurologist. The patient is alive, residing at a 
sub-acute rehabilitation facility, and is not currently on any MS therapy. The neurologist assessed the patient s 
estimated Karnofsky and EDSS scores at 6 months post-PML diagnosis to be 40 (disabled; requires special care 
and assistance) and 6.5. An MRI of the brain was performed on 20 Nov 2013 with results reported as follows: 
numerous patchy foci of abnormal T2/FLAIR hyperintensity throughout the supra-and infratentorial brain 
parenchyma, many of which again have increased in T2 signal intensity suggestive of cavitation. Overall, there is 
stable number and extent of enhancing lesions with interval slight decreased extent of the more confluent areas of 
T2/FLAIR hyperintensity within the subinsular and subcortical regions as above. The neurologist noted that the 
patient never had IRIS (discrepant from previously received information).
Update 09 Jun 2014: Additional information was received from the neurologist. The patient is alive, residing at 
home, and is currently receiving Copaxone (glatiramer acetate) for MS treatment. The neurologist assessed the 
patient s estimated Karnofsky and EDSS scores at 12 months post-PML diagnosis to be 50 (requires considerable 
assistance and frequent medical care) and 6.5, respectively. An MRI was performed 27 Dec 2013 and no 
information was provided. An MRI of the brain was performed on 18 Feb 2014 with results reported as follows: 
overall decrease in FLAIR signal hyperintensity and size of the multiple supratentorial and infratentorial white matter
lesions, as well as their associated patchy/stippled enhancement, when compared with the most recent prior 
examination from 27 Dec 2013. There was no evidence of new or enhancing lesion and there was stable diffuse 
cerebral volume loss. The neurologist noted that the patient had no clinical or radiologic signs of IRIS.
Update 08 Sep 2014: A report was received via a literature: P857 Zhovtis Ryerson, I Kister, and J Herbert
(September 2014). Maraviroc and JC - virus associated immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome. Multiple 
Sclerosis Journal 2014; 20: (S1) 285 496. Retrieved from msj.sagepub.com. The authors reported 2 cases of 
Maraviroc-treated disseminated PML-NTZ which no clinically or radiologically significant IRIS was observed over 3-
15 months of follow up. The first patient refers to this case who is 49 year old woman with relapsing remitting 
multiple sclerosis (RRMS) on NZB for 3 years and 6 months who presented for a second opinion with 3 months of 
worsening numbness, ataxia, and dysarthria. Brain MRI suggested wide -spread PML and spinal fluid analysis 
confirmed the diagnosis, with 390 JCV copies/mL detected ((b) (6) ). Maraviroc 300mg twice a day was 
initiated after plasmapheresis (PLEX). Patient remained free of clinically significant IRIS. Patient s clinical status 
and MRI stabilized over 6 month and Maraviroc was tapered. Patient was discharged home in stable condition; her

EDSS is 6.5.
Update 12 Sep 2014: Information was received via a poster presented at the 2014 Joint Annual Meeting of the 
Americas Committee for Treatment and Research in Multiple Sclerosis (ACTRIMS) and the European Committee 
for Treatment and Research in Multiple Sclerosis (ECTRIMS), Boston, MA. L Zhovtis Ryerson, I Kister, and J 
Herbert  (September 2014). Maraviroc and JC - virus associated immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome. 
The authors presented a PML case involving a 49 year old, HIV negative woman with a history of RRMS for 12 
years who presented for a second opinion in Jun 2013 with symptoms of periobital numbness, dysarthria, 
dysgeusia and later to difficulties with balance and cognition. She tested JCV Ab positive and received TYSABRI for
42 months with the last infusion in May 2013. Imaging findings from Jun 2013 were consistent with wide spread 
PML (Figure 1A-D; at PML diagnosis). CSF JCV DNA returned positive at 390 copies/mL from (b) (6)  The patient
underwent PLEX to help escalate TYSABRI clearance and was started on maraviroc 300mg twice daily. The patient
remained free of clinical IRIS, although consecutive MRI brain imaging studies from Aug 2013 showed faint 
peripheral enhancement in some of the previously identified T2/FLAIR hyperintense lesions (Figure 1F,H). 
Patient s clinical status and MRI abnormalities attenuated over 6 months of treatment by Oct 2013 (Figure 1I-L) 
and maraviroc was tapered off. No adverse side effects related to maraviroc were observed during the course of 
treatment. On 12 month follow-up, patient s exam was significant for dysarthria, facial numbness, ataxia, and right 
greater than left hemiparesis, with EDSS of 7.0. MRI brain from Jul 2014 exhibited significant improvement in 
T2/FLAIR supratentorial and infratentorial hyper intensities with resolution of Gd enhancement. She was started on 
Copaxone 20mg SC daily for ongoing MS treatment. 
Update 18 Jul 2015: A report was received from literature: Anbarasan D, Howard J, Ryerson LZ (2014) Use of 
Maraviroc in the prevention and Treatment of Immune Reconstitution Inflammatory Syndrome in Natalizumab-
Associated Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy. J Mult Scler 1: 116. doi:10.4172/jmso.1000116. The 
authors discussed the case of a 49 year old HIV negative female with a history of RRMS for 12 years who 
presented with complaints of three months of worsening ataxia and dysarthria. Her symptoms began with 
numbness in the lips, which then progressed to dysarthria and dysgeusia and later to difficulties with balance and 
cognition. She had been known to be JC virus (JCV) antibody-positive and had been maintained on natalizumab for
42 months with the last infusion being given one month prior to presentation. Brain MRI with and without gadolinium
 (date unspecified) revealed multiple enhancing T2/FLAIR hyperintensities in the bilateral middle cerebellar 
peduncles and the pons in addition to a non-enhancing T2/FLAIR hyperintensity in the right parieto-occipital white 
matter that was associated with mild mass effect. Imaging findings were consistent with wide-spread PML (image 
provided). CSF analysis confirmed the diagnosis with an elevated JC viral load of 390 copies/mL detected using a 
PCR assay performed by (b) (6)  The patient underwent plasmapheresis to help escalate natalizumab 
clearance and was started on oral maraviroc 300 mg twice a day. The patient remained free of clinical IRIS,

identified T2/FLAIR hyperintense lesions (image provided). Patient s clinical status and MRI abnormalities 
attenuated over 6 months of treatment and maraviroc was tapered. No adverse side effects related to maraviroc 
were observed during the course of treatment. The patient was noted to show slow improvement of her 
neurological deficits and imaging findings over the course of nine months. At time of follow-up 12 months after 
initiation of treatment with maraviroc, the patient continued to exhibit mild dysarthria, facial numbness, and ataxia. 
MRI brain exhibited near-resolution of all T2/FLAIR supratentorial and infratentorial hyperintensities with only 
minimal residual gadolinium enhancement detected. No new MS disease activity was noted. She was started on 
subcutaneous glatiramer acetate injections 20 mg daily for ongoing treatment of MS.
