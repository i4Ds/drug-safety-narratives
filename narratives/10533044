A report was received, via a Biogen Idec Account Business Manager and Medical Science Liaison, from a 
dissertation: Grosset-Janin C. A retrospective study of 13 patients who developed progressive multifocal 
leukoencephalopathy under natalizumab: clinical and radiological. The dissertation was presented at University of 
Toulouse, France, on 02 Oct 2014. The author presented 13 cases of PML from two university hospitals. The 
diagnosis of PML was made or suspected between Dec 2009 and Jun 2014. Patient information was collected from
medical records that were reviewed retrospectively from the hospital databases. The article reported that the male 
patient(b) (6)  was diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis in 2002 at the age of 26. The neurologist assessed the event of 
PML as possible. JCV PCR in CSF was negative. At the time of PML diagnosis, the patient was 34 year old and MS
was evolving for 8 years. TYSABRI was started 6 years after MS was diagnosed and was stopped for 50 days at 
the time of PML. The patient had received 35 infusions. JCV serology was not provided. The patient had not 
received any immunosuppressive agent before TYSABRI and had 1 or 2 risk factors for the event. French
