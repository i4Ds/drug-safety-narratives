Medically Significant
A neurologist reported that a 49 year old male patient on TYSABRI (300 mg, IV, QM) for MS from unknown date to 
unknown date experienced PML suspicion (onset unknown) due to the occurence of right homonymous lateral 
hemianopia.  Lumbar puncture was performed on 20 Jun 2014 for (b) (6)  Laboratory testing.  It was reported that 
the MRI was also suspicious. The outcome for the event PML suspicion is unknown. The causality for the event of 
PML suspicion was assessed as related.  TYSABRI therapy was discontinued.  French Imputability C1SI1
Update 01 Jul 2014: A neurologist reported that JCV testing of CSF (previously reported lumbar puncture on 20 Jun
2014) came back negative from (b) (6) . The remaining CSF samples are planned to be sent to (b) (6)  
for further testing. No further information. French Imputability: C1S1I1

Update 07 Jul 2014: The neurologist reported additional information. Multiple Sclerosis was diagnosed in 2000. The
patient was treated with Copaxone since 30 Dec 2006, stopped on an unknown date, and was then switched to 
TYSABRI on 24 Jun 2010 with initial EDSS at 3.0.  Anti-JCV were found positive on 04 Jan 2012 and on 14 Nov 
2014 (future date, to be clarified) with ((b) (6)  test). For 1 month, the patient experienced a partial hemianopsia 
on the right side.  Otherwise his clinical condition was stable.  A MRI was performed on 06 Mar 2014 and no new 
left occipital hypersignal was detected by the radiologist or the neurologist. TYSABRI was discontinued on 28 May 
2014 after the patient had received a total of 52 infusions. On 05 Jun 2014, a new MRI was performed and a left 
occipital hypersignal was detected by the radiologist. As previously reported, the (b) (6)  test (JCV CSF DNA) (with
sample drawn on 20 Jun 2014) was negative and (b) (6)  test (using the same sample) is pending. MRI performed 
on 09 Jul 2014 showed the same lesion now is Gd+ (Gadolinium enhancing). PLEX discussed (presumed as 
possible treatment).  According the neurologist, the patient has a high suspicion [for PML]. French Imputability: 
C2S1I1.
Update 13 Jul 2014: Additional information received from the neurologist. The patient received a total of 52 
infusions from 24 Jun 2010 to 28 May 2014. He presented right hemianopia as symptoms after a few weeks. MRI 
performed on 05 Jun 2014 prompted the suspicion of PML, however, the lesion already existed on 06 Mar 2014 as 
discovered a posteriori. MRI showed typical occipital lesion not Gadolinium enhanced with the size of the lesion 
increased between the two exams. Lumbar puncture was performed on 20 Jun 2014 with negative results from 
(b) (6) and(b) (6)  result pending. Plasmapheresis was planned for the next week. The patient is not currently on any
MS therapy. French Imputability: C2S1I1
Update 28 Jul 2014: Additional information was received from the neurologist. JCV PCR testing by NIH provided a 
result of 14 copies per mL. The patient was discharged home after 5 rounds of plasmapheresis were performed. 
IRIS was monitored but not occur. At the time of the report, the patient was clinically stable with an isolated right 
homonymous hemianopia. On 26-JUL-2014, after plasmapheresis, a MRI was performed and showed a stable 
result. The neurologist retained the final diagnosis as PML. According to the neurologist, the PML is related to 
TYSABRI. A switch to Gylenya (fingolimod) was planned. French Imputability: C2S2I2.
Update 12 Aug 2014: Case report was recevied from French Health Authorities (ANSM via CRPV of Strasbourg: 
registry # ST20140787).  The 50 year old male patient on TYSABRI (10 mg, IV, QM) for Multiple Sclerosis from 24 
Jun 2010 to 28 May 2014 was hospitalized from an unknown date to an unknown date for hemianopsia, virus JC 
positive, and viral antibodies abnormal (presumed signs and symptoms of previously reported PML suspicion). The 
patient was diagnosed of MS in 2000 and was previously treated with Copaxone from the end of 2006 and switched
to TYSABRI on 24 Jun 2010 due to MS relapses persisting. A routine MRI on 05 Jun 2014 revealed a new left 
occipital lesion (not identified by the radiologist neither as new MS lesion not as suspected PML lesion). The patient
reported that he had a right hemianopsia for one month. PCR of JC virus (with 50 copies/mL as detection

threshold) was performed and the result was negative. The same test was performed in another medical analysis 
laboratory and the result was positive with 14 copies/mL. Plasma exchanges were started. On 03 Jul 2014, a new 
MRI was performed and MS lesion was "doubtless" confirmed. On MRI, performed on 06 Mar 2014, the lesion was 
already present (size of lesion has increased since then), but the lesion was not detected by the radiologist and the 
patient had no visual disorders. The radiologist had concluded that the lesions were stable. Plasma exchanges 
were continued due to the risk of IRIS. Until now, the patient had well tolerated TYSABRI and continued to work. 
The events are ongoing. The causality was assessed by the French Health Authorities as possibly related to 
TYSABRI.  TYSABRI therapy was discontinued. French Imputability: C1S3I2
Update 23 Sep 2014: Follow-up information was received from the French Health Authorities (ANSM via CRPV of 
Strasbourg: registry # ST20140787). The 5 plasmapheresis sessions were well tolerated by the patient. The MRI 
monitoring was stable. At the beginning of Sep 2014, MRI revealed a very important PML worsening described as 
original posterior left lesion + appearance in left frontal area, right thalamus, right cerebellum with Gd enhancement 
with no edema. It was not considered an IRIS or MS relapse. No further information was provided.  French 
Imputability: C1S3I2
Update 23 Sep 2014: The neurologist reported that the patient died during the night of (b) (6)  to (b) (6)  
(b) (6)  No other information was provided concerning this death.
Update 29 Sep 2014: Follow-up information received from the neurologist included brain MRI descriptions.  On 19 
Dec 2013 brain MRI showed a slight left occipital hypersignal almost unnoticeable is visible.  On 06 Mar 2014 the 
lesion is now distinctly visible but neither the neurologist, nor the radiologist have detected it.  On 05 Jun 2014 at 
that time, the lesion was reported but not assessed as PML suspected. French Imputability: C1S3I2
Update 02 Oct 2014: Biogen Idec considers this case confirmed for PML based on CSF and Radiologic evidence
Update 02 Oct 2014: Case report recevied from French Health Authorities (ANSM via CRPV of Strasbourg: registry
# ST20140787) reported the patient died on(b) (6)  after a worsening in three weeks despite bolus of 
SoluMedrol and one day after falling into a coma.  French Imputability: C1S2I1
Update 20 Oct 2014: Additional information was received from the neurologist via a MS Standardized PML Data 
Collection Tool. The neurologist assessed the patient?s estimated Karnofsky scores as follows: 80 (normal activity 
with effort; some signs or symptoms of disease) prior to staring TYSABRI (date unspecified); 90 (able to carry on 
normal activity; minor signs or symptoms of disease) on 28 May 2014; 80 on 20 Jun 2014. It was reported that 
serodiagnosis for Lyme, HIV, CMN, EBV, cysticercosis, toxoplasmosis were negative or immunization. The patient 
underwent five PLEX sessions: 16 Jul, 18 Jul, 21 Jul, 23 Jul, and 25 Jul 2014. The sessions were well tolerated

with the patient being clinically stable (only homonymous hemianopia at this time) and unchanged MRI after the five
sessions. The patient was diagnosed with IRIS, with onset date of 08 Aug 2014. The date of MRI onset was 04 Sep
2014. The neurologist noted cephalgia (left hemicrania) as a sign/ symptom of IRIS, but reported that it was hard to 
tell as cephalgia had already been present on 08 Aug 2014 and was intermittent. Treatment medication for MS, 
PML and/ or IRIS included Gilenya from 18 Aug 2014 to 04 Sep 2014 and Solumedrol 1 GM from 17 Sep 2014 to 
22 Sep 2014. The patient died on (b) (6)  An autopsy was not performed. Cause of death was noted to be 
related to PML and unrelated to TYSABRI.
Update 20 Oct 2014: Additional information was received from the neurologist via a MS Standardized PML Data 
Collection Tool and included additional MRI reports. The neurologist assessed the patient?s estimated Karnofsky 
scores as follows: 80 (normal activity with effort; some signs or symptoms of disease) prior to staring TYSABRI 
(date unspecified); 90 (able to carry on normal activity; minor signs or symptoms of disease) on 28 May 2014; 80 on
20 Jun 2014. It was reported that serodiagnosis for Lyme, HIV, CMN, EBV, cysticercosis, toxoplasmosis were 
negative or immunization. 
The patient underwent five PLEX sessions: 16 Jul, 18 Jul, 21 Jul, 23 Jul, and 25 Jul 2014. The sessions were well 
tolerated with the patient being clinically stable (only homonymous hemianopia at this time) and unchanged MRI 
after the five sessions. Brain MRI performed on 26 Jul 2014 (monitoring of PML after 5 plasmatic exchanges) 
stability of PML limited to left parieto-occipital area, persisting focal enhancement in the pathologic area in favor of 
an IRIS (enhancement not present on the initial MRI), and disappearance of intra axial enhancements in the left 
frontal convexity.
Brain MRI performed on 08 Aug 2014 showed PML limited to the left parieto-occipital area, no modification of the 
focal enhancement on the posterolateral edge of the pathological area which can be integrated in the context of 
PML or IRIS (as enhancement was non-existent on the initial MRI), and no appearance of new demyelinating 
inflammatory lesion.  Brain MRI performed on 04 Sep 2014 showed very clear increase in lesions previously 
described and appearance of new lesions which lead to discuss about a clear PML and/or IRIS progression.  Brain 
MRI performed on 12 Sep 2014 showed no change compared MRI performed on 04 Sep 2014.  The patient was 
diagnosed with IRIS, with onset date of 08 Aug 2014. The date of MRI onset was 04 Sep 2014. The neurologist 
noted cephalgia (left hemicrania) as a sign/ symptom of IRIS, but reported that it was hard to tell as cephalgia had 
already been present on 08 Aug 2014 and was intermittent. Treatment medication for MS, PML and/ or IRIS 
included Gilenya from 18 Aug 2014 to 04 Sep 2014 and Solumedrol 1 g from 17 Sep 2014 to 22 Sep 2014.
Brain MRI performed on (b) (6)  showed very clear increase in mass effect due to lesions previously 
described with appearance of subfalcine herniation on the right side, left internal temporal herniation and 
diencephalic herniation.  The patient died on (b) (6)  An autopsy was not performed. Cause of death was

noted to be related to PML, as the patient never had any other symptoms than initial symptoms, no fever, and no 
meningeal signs.  The death was considered unrelated to TYSABRI.  The cause of death was noted to be slow, 
progressive, worsening with right hemiparesis, aphasia, slowing, the patient was confied to bed from 16 Sep, then 
went into a coma for 24 hours on (b) (6)  and died during the night at 10PM.  It was noted that when PML was 
dignosed, the patient clearly stated that he did not want any intensive care or "therapeutic obstinacy."
