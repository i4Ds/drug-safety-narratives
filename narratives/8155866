89-year- old Caucasian female patient was hospitalized w pneumonitis weeks after initiation of 
study therapy with cetuximab and pemetrexed for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer. The patienrs 
medical history d  0 Stage 1 Carcinoma of left breast in that was treated with turne  omy and 
ongoing Airlift( maintenance et . The patient was di:.a oed th squamous cell carcinoma of the lung in 
May 2007 and was treated with six cycles of Carboplafin/Gemzar with marginal improvement. In April 2008, the 
patient presented with a 30 pound weight loss, pain in the right lung and PET scan results suggesting disease 
sslon. The patient then enrolled in the above study and was randomized to receive cetuximab and 
pemetrexed (Arm 1P). On 24Apr2008, the patient received the initial infusion of both cetuximab and pemetrexed. 
TM patienrs most 0 , infusion of pemetrexed was on 23.M2008, and the most recent infusion of cetuximab 
was on 3tUuI2008. On the patient contacted the investigator reporting profound fatigue, anorexia and 
inability to eat During egxalneon. at an office visit the patient was observed to have right lower extremity edema, 
tachycardia, dehydration and Dyspnea. Lab. work revealed an elevated BUN and creatinine (results not specified). 
The patient was ' with 0 tie and was admitted to the hospital for hydration and to rule out the 
possibility of an underlying deep vein thrombosis and/or pulmonary emboli. The investigator also planned for the 
patient to have a MRI of the brain to rule out new central nervous metastases. While in the hospital, the patient's 
condition worsened and the toxicity grade for pneumonitis was changed to grade 4. The patient experienced 
ventilation failure (etiology remains unknown) and was placed on a ventilator. The patient did not to e attempts 
to ext and , 0  remained on the ventilator. During the hospitalization the patient's platelet count declined 
(results not specified), , the investigator suspects may be heparin induced thrombocytopenia versus 
chemotherapy induced. The patienrs treatment was adjusted and intravenous fluids were decreased because the 
patient started to have fluid *overload-.  At the time of this report, the patient remained hospitalized and had not

unknown. Additional information is expected. The investigator did not provide causality assessment for the event

pneumonitis in a69-year old female patient five days after the most recent and 3.5 months after the initial infusion 
of cetuximab for the treatment of NSCLC. The event was probably related to the underlying malignancy and prior 
radlOtherapy and unlikely related to the study agents. However, due to temporal association, the contribution of 
cetuximab could not be ruled out. Hence, considers the event to be possibly related to 
cetuximab and pemetrexed pending reassessment upon receipt of additional information. Follow -up #1: 
Information on 21Aug2008 amended the seriousness criteria to death (previously reported as 
hospitalization and life threatening). It also amended the severity grade to 5 (previously reported as grade 4), the

related to cetuximab and pemetrexed. ImClone Systems' assessment remains unchanged. Follow-up #2: 
received on 07 ir z provided an expiration summary. On further review of the previous information 
it was realized that the patient's age had erroneously been re..  . as 69-years. Corrections were made to reflect 
her age at the time of event occurrence which as 73 years. The 73-year-old female patient with metastatic lung 
cancer was admitted on with complaints of fatigue, anorexia, dehydration and being unable to eat. On 
admission, she was a to be ta ycardic and tachypneic and laboratory findings revealed severe dehydration 
(blood urea ' o . of 14 mg/dt. and creatine of 2 mg/dL). The patient immediately started on fluid 
resuscitation and within 24 hours, developed severe dyspna requiring intubation. After a wort-up for thee o oy of

an acute pulmonary embolism. Eventually, the patient started to exhibit symptoms consistent with adult type 
respiratory distress syndrome and throughout the rest of the hospital stay, received enteral feedings, antibiotics, 
steroids and continuous intensive care unit support. Several attempts at extubation were unsuccessful and as the 
patient's condition continued to deteriorate, the family invoked her li will and decided that it was time to take 
her off heroic intervention and let her succumb to her disease. On after sedation and extubation, the 
patient died. The investigators assessment remained unchanged. e Systems' assessment remains
