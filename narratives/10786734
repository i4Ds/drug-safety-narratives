A neurologist reported that a 59 year old female patient on TYSABRI (300 mg, IV, QM) for Multiple Sclerosis from 
05 Jan 2009 to 17 Nov 2014 and enrolled in a Biogen Idec sponsored marketing program of Monitored Therapy 
experienced PML characterized by feeling off balance (onset 05 Dec 2014). At the time of this report, the TOUCH 
database indicated the patient received 62 infusions of Tysabri from 05 Jan 2009 to 17 Nov 2014.  The patient first 
presented with MS symptoms in 1988.  Prior MS therapy included Rebif (interferon beta-1a), Cellcept 
(mycophenolate), and Avonex. Patient was tested for JC virus (JCV antibody) in April with a result of 0.46. Patient 
was tested again during the last quarter of 2014 (exact date not known) and results had increased to 1.3. An MRI 
was performed on December 9th with no new lesions found, however patient had reported feeling off balance on 
December 5. A lumbar puncture was performed on January 6, 2015 and was analyzed by the (b) (6)  The 
results came back positive for JC Viral DNA. An MRI and another lumbar puncture were performed on (b) (6)
 in response to JC viral DNA results. The results of the 2nd lumbar puncture came back on January 26, 2015

with findings of 130 copies of JC viral DNA. The patient is enrolled in the (b) (6)  study. The event of PML c/b 
feeling off balance is ongoing. The causality for the event of PML c/b feeling off balance is unknown.  TYSABRI 
therapy was discontinued.
Update 30 Jan 2015: Follow-up information received included STRATIFY JCV antibody results.  JCV antibody 
testing on 27 Apr 2011 was indeterminate (0.246 nOD) and retest detected 0.347 nOD.  JCV antibody testing on 20
Mar 2013 was indeterminate (index of 0.37) and retest was positive (index of 0.55).  JCV antibody testing on 30 Apr
2014 was positive (index of 0.46).  JCV antibody testing on 15 Oct 2014 was positive (index of 1.32).
Update 30 Jan 2015: Follow-up information received indicated the patient was hospitalized for pneumonia.  No 
further information was provided.
Update 11 Feb 2015: Follow-up information was received from a nurse practitioner at the physician's office. Prior 
immunosuppressant therapy included Cellcept (mycophenolate) from Oct 2007 to Aug 2008. The patient did not 
have any symptoms [of PML], the only trigger was the increase in JCV antibody index after which the patient 
underwent MRI. At this time, the patient has experienced a little more weakness in her legs, but also has a history 
of post-polio syndrome, so she didn t think much of a little more weakness in her legs. CSF test (from 06 Jan 
2015) came back positive from (b) (6)  and the patient was admitted on (b) (6)  for repeat lumbar puncture 
performed on (b) (6)  with CSF sent to (b) (6)  Laboratories. The patient underwent one session of PLEX 
(plasma exchange) while hospitalized but after consultation with another physician, PLEX was held.  The patient 
was discharged on (b) (6) . (b) (6)  CSF DNA JCV results came back positive at 130 copies/ml. The patient 
was then scheduled for evaluation by the consulting physician on 30 Jan 2015.  However, the patient developed 
and infection, pneumonia or infection from PIC line (previously reported as pneumonia) and was readmitted on (b)(6)  
(b) (6)  for intravenous antibiotics. The patient was discharged from the hospital on (b) (6)  and is currently 
doing very well, with no change in neurologic status. The patient has not received any treatment for PML, they are 
considering RUSH protocol but nothing yet. MRIs on 03 Feb 2015 and 10 Feb 2015 were stable. 
Update 11 Feb 2015: The nurse practitioner provided MRI reports, CSF results, and laboratory reports.  On 21 May 
2014, head MRI (with and without contrast) was consistent with 09 Aug 2013: stable changes of known MS, 
numerous bilateral white matter foci of increased T2 signal, predominantly in periventricular white matter, many 
oriented perpendicular to the ependymal surface. A subcortical lesion in right temporal lobe is less apparent on 
today s examination. No new foci of signal abnormality with particular attention to the subcortical U fibers. None of 
the white matter lesions exhibit restricted diffusion or enhancement. No new white matter lesions to suggest 
disease progression, no findings typical for PML.  On 09 Dec 2014, head MRI (with and without contrast) was 
consistent with 21 May 2014: Essentially stable compared to May 21, 2014, Again seen are multiple white matter 
lesions demonstrating increased T2 signal within the cerebral hemispheres bilaterally. These predominate in the

periventricular white matter and are oriented perpendicular to the axis of the ventricles. No new lesions are 
identified. No enhancement is identified suggest active demyelination.  On 06 Jan 2015, CSF JCV DNA testing by 
(b) (6)  laboratory was positive. Comprehensive metabolic panel was within normal limits except for low estimated 
glomerular filtration rate of 55 mL/min/1.73m^2 (reference range >59.9). Lymphocyte panel was within normal 
limits. On (b) (6)  serum IgG was low at 505 mg/dL (reference range 767-1590). On (b) (6)  CSF 
protein, MS panel, and cell count with differential was within normal limits except for high monocyte/macrophage 
level of 53% (reference range 15-45%); CSF testing for CMV and Lyme disease were negative.  JCV DNA testing 
by (b) (6)  was positive with 130 copies/mL.  On (b) (6)  head MRI (with and without contrast) was 
consistent with 09 Dec 2014: multiple areas of increased T2 signal in the periventricular white matter bilaterally, 
oriented perpendicular to the long axis of the corpus callosum highly suggestive of a demyelinating disorder.  No 
significant interval change compared to the prior study. No evidence of enhancement or restricted diffusion to 
suggest active demyelination.  On (b) (6)  T-spine/C-spine MRI (with and without contrast) was consistent 
with 09 Dec 2014: no evidence of a demyelinating process, tumor or other spinal cord pathology in the cervical and 
thoracic spine. No abnormal contrast enhancement within or around the spinal cord.  On 03 Feb 2015, head MRI 
(with and without contrast) was consistent with (b) (6)  again seen are multifocal areas of increased T2 signal
involving the white matter of the cerebral hemispheres bilaterally, predominantly involving the periventricular white 
matter. The appearance is stable compared to (b) (6)  No enhancement of the white matter lesions is 
identified. The appearance is again consistent with demyelinating disease. There is no evidence of restricted 
diffusion on diffusion weighted imaging.  On 10 Feb 2015, head MRI (with and without contrast) was consistent with
03 Feb 2015. The findings showed the previously seen multifocal white matter T2 hyperintensities have not 
changed significantly in size, number or appearance. No progression or definite new lesion is identified. On post 
contrast images, no new enhancing lesions are identified. There is no new abnormal parenchymal or meningeal 
enhancement. The midline structures, posterior fossa and cranio-cervical junction are stable. Impression: 1. 
Multifocal white matter T2 hyperintensities compatible with demyelinating disease, without a significant change in 
appearance compared to 03 Feb 2015, No new or enhancing lesions are identified. 2. No other acute intracranial 
findings.
Update 20 Feb 2015: Follow-up information was received from the nurse practitioner. The patient had a follow-up 
appointment on 16 Feb 2015. The patient was stable and doing well. The patient received no further PML 
treatment. The patient is schedule to undergo repeat lumbar puncture (CSF JCV PCR testing by (b) (6) ) in mid-
March and serial MRIs every 3-4 months. The office will provide MRI images from previously described MRIs.
Update 19 Mar 2015: Follow-up information was received from the nurse practitioner. A follow-up lumbar puncture 
was scheduled for this week and a follow-up MRI will be performed in a week and a half. The nurse practitioner 
agreed to provide the MRI images once completed.

Update 14 May 2015: Follow-up information was received from a registered nurse at the neurologist's office. The 
patient is currently doing well and will be following up with another MRI in the next couple of weeks.
Update 18 Jun 2015: Follow-up information received included medical records as well as MRI images for the 
following dates: 08 Mar 2013, 09 Aug 2013, 21 May 2014, 09 Dec 2014, (b) (6) (b) (6)  03 Feb 2015, 
10 Feb 2015, 06 Mar 2015, 20 Mar 2015, 24 Apr 2015, and 05 Jun 2015. The patient's medical history included 
type 2 diabetes mellitus. TYSABRI was indicated for relapsing remitting MS. 
On 08 Mar 2013 the patient underwent MRI of the head which showed extensive demyelinating lesions in the deep 
and periventricular white matter bilaterally, similar in size, number, and appearance compared to 25 Jan 2012; no 
new lesion or enhancing lesion identified.  On 09 Aug 2013 the patient underwent MRI of the head which showed 
multifocal T2 hyperintensities in the periventricular white matter bilaterally, similar to 08 Mar 2013, most likely 
representing underlying demyelinating disease such as MS; no abnormal enhancing processes have developed; no
MRI findings to suggest interval development of PML.
On 01 May 2014 the patient tested positive for JCV antibody.  On 06 Jan 2015, lymphocyte T-cell panel showed the
following: CD3 1500cells/mcl (reference range 550-2202), 72% (58-86), CD4 949 cells/mcl (reference range 365-
1437), 46% (32-64), and CD8 727 (reference range 117-846), 35% (11-40). CSF sample collected on (b) (6)
tested negative for VDRL. Concomitant medications (as of Jan 2015) included ascorbic acid, bifidobacterium 
infantis, bupropion, calcium carbonate, cholecalciferol, clonazepam, cranberry, cyclobenzaprine, 
dextroamphetamine/amphetamine, escitalopram oxalate, Vytorin (ezetimibe/simvastatin), fenofibtrate micronized, 
ferrous sulfate, Norco (hydrocodone/acetaminophen), ibuprofen, lamotrigine, levothyroxine, losartan, mirtazapine, 
multivitamin, Actoplus Met (pioglitazone/metformin), prednisone, and sitagliptin.  On 06 Mar 2015 the patient 
underwent MRI of the head which showed re-demonstration of numerous focal areas of increased T2 signal seen 
largely within the periventricular territory of the bilateral cerebral hemispheres, with several subcortically positioned 
T2 hyperintense lesions also seen, most notably within the right frontal and right parietal lobes. No mass effect or 
midline shift is seen. The ventricles themselves are normal in morphology. Diffusion-weighted imaging 
demonstrates T2 shadowing through of several of these periventricular white matter lesions, without definite true 
restricted diffusion identified. Following contrast administration, no definite focal areas of abnormal parenchymal or 
meningeal contrast enhancement are identified. The basilar cisterns are patent. No extra-axial fluid collections are 
seen. The impression noted stable MRI head examination, with re-demonstration of white matter changes 
consistent with demyelinating disease. No enhancement or restricted diffusion to suggest active demyelination.
On 20 Mar 2015 the patient underwent MRI of the head which showed multiple regions of increased T2 signal 
within the subcortical and periventricular white matter bilaterally in a nonspecific distribution. There is been no 
significant interval change given differences in technique and slice registration. No evidence of restricted diffusion 
or enhancement to suggest active demyelination. The impression noted stable MR imaging of the brain with and

without contrast. Re-demonstration of the periventricular white matter T2 signal in normalities remain unchanged 
compared to the prior study.
CSF sample collected on 24 Mar 2015 tested negative for JCV DNA ((b) (6)  laboratory).  CSF analysis of 29 ml of 
clear colorless sample, collected on 24 Mar 2015, showed nucleated cells 8/ul (reference range 0-8), neutrophils 
0% (reference range 0-6), lymphocytes 94% (reference range 40-80), monocyte/macrophage 6% (reference range 
15-45), glucose 58 mg/dl (reference range 40-75), and protein 23.7 mg/dl (reference range 15-45).  On 24 Mar 
2015, MS panel laboratory tests were performed on CSF and serum samples and showed the following: CSF 
oligoclonal bands 8 (reference range <4), serum bands 0, CSF IgG index 1.05 (reference range <0.85), CSF IgG 
2.2 mg/dl (reference range <8.1), CSF albumin 10.8 mg/dl (reference range <27), serum IgG 689 mg/dl (reference 
range 767-1590), serum albumin 3610 mg/dl (reference range 3200-4800), CSF albumin 0.20 (reference range 
<0.21), serum IgG/albumin 0.19 (reference range <0.40), CSF IgG synthesis rate 5.23 mg/24hrs (reference range 
<12).  On 24 Apr 2015 the patient underwent MRI of the head which showed multiple regions of increased T2 signal
within the subcortical and periventricular white matter bilaterally. The vast majority of these T2 lesions within the 
white matter remain unchanged.There is a new lesion within the subcortical white matter involving the left frontal 
lobe middle frontal gyrus. This white matter lesion is quite hyperintense on T2 measuring 5 mm x 3 mm x 7 mm in 
size and has avid post contrast enhancement and surrounding T2 edema. This is a new lesion and likely reflects 
active demyelination. No additional new lesions are identified.  On 05 Jun 2015 the patient underwent MRI of the 
head which again showed multiple regions of increased T2 signal intensity within the subcortical and periventricular 
white matter of the cerebral hemispheres bilaterally. The vast majority of these T2 hyperintense lesions in the white 
matter are stable compared to April 24, 2015. There are 2 exceptions: the previously seen enhancing lesion within 
the left frontal lobe is again present; however, this is less conspicuous on the current exam. There is a mild degree 
of enhancement which persists; however less intense than on April 24, 2015. Additionally the degree of T2 
hyperintense signal associated with this lesion is less than on the prior exam from April 24, 2015. Additionally there 
is a possible faint new lesion identified within the subcortical white matter of the right frontal lobe seen on series 6 
image 16 which is not identifiable on the prior exams. This does not demonstrate enhancement. This measures 
approximately 4 mm in size. No lesions are identified in the brain stem or cerebellum. No mass effect, no midline 
shift, no convincing evidence of restricted diffusion on diffusion-weighted imaging.
Update 01 Jul 2015: Follow-up information was received from a nurse practitioner at the neurologist's office. The 
patient is planned to undergo the next brain and cervical MRIs in about 2-3 months.
