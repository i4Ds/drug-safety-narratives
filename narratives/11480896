change. In the MRT skull lesion and then diagnosis of a progressive multifocal sarcoidosis. Because of increased 
eye pressure under steroids 50mg/d change to prednisolone and azathioprine.
Measures: discontinuing of the immunosuppressants without replacement.
At the time of the report the outcome of the AEs were: PROGRESSIVE MULTIFOCAL 
LEUKOENCEPHALOPATHY : recovering/resolving, JC VIRUS TEST POSITIVE: Unknown.
Action taken with suspect drugs: azathioprin - Drug discontinued; prednisolon - Drug discontinued.

Reporter's causality assessment: 
The reporter assessed the causality between PROGRESSIVE MULTIFOCAL LEUKOENCEPHALOPATHY and 
azathioprin as Possible.
The reporter assessed the causality between PROGRESSIVE MULTIFOCAL LEUKOENCEPHALOPATHY and 
prednisolon as Possible. 
This case was considered serious based on the following criteria: (Life Threatening, Hospitalization Required, 
Disability or Permanent Damage)
Teva Comment: PROGRESSIVE MULTIFOCAL LEUKOENCEPHALOPATHY is possibly related to 
AZATHIOPRINE and PREDNISOLONE. The event positive JC Virus test is not related to both drugs but to the virus
itself.
Because this is a spontaneous case, regulatory distribution will be handled as though it is a related case.
