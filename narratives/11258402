A hospital neurologist spontaneously reported that a 54 year old male patient on TYSABRI (300 mg, IV, QM) for 
Multiple Sclerosis (MS) from 2007 to Apr 2015 was hospitalized from an unknown date to an unknown date for 
suspicion of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) characterized by worsening spasticity (onset 2015).
 The patient was diagnosed with MS on an unknown date.  Prior exposure to immunosuppressive/ 
immunomodulatory therapy was not reported.  Prior MS therapy included FAMPYRA.  The patient tested positive 
for anti-JCV antibodies in Sep 2013 (index value not reported) and in Feb 2014 with an index value of 2.64.  No 
testing for the event of suspected PML was reported.  Treatment included plasmapheresis during the 
hospitalization and maraviroc.  The outcome for the event of suspected PML was unknown.  The causality for the 
event of suspected PML was unknown.  At the time of this report, the patient was no longer hospitalized and 
reported as "doing well".  TYSABRI therapy was discontinued.

Update 26 Jun 2015:  The neurologist provided the following additional information via a suspect Data Collection 
Tool.  The patient was diagnosed with MS in 2007; symptoms included repeated spastic mono and parapareses.
Previous MS therapy included Betaferon.  Past medical history included depression.  Concomitant medications 
included mirtazapine and venlafaxine.  The patient was on TYSABRI from 01 Jan 2007 to 30 Apr 2015 with an 
administration frequency of every 5 weeks, without interruption.  During TYSABRI therapy the patient had a routine 
MRI every 6 months.  The patient received a total of 38 infusions of TYSABRI and had not been included in any 
TYSABRI studies.  PML was suspected due to findings on a routine MRI and the patient was asymptomatic.  The 
MRI from 29 Apr 2015 was suspicious for PML characterized by extensive subcortical T2 lesions in the left frontal 
region, DWI negative, no contrast enhancement.  The patient was hospitalized from (b) (6)  to (b) (6)  for 
suspicion of PML.  A lumbar puncture (LP) was done on (b) (6)  and the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was positive 
for JCV DNA at 218 copies/ mL; the CSF analysis was otherwise without pathological findings.  Treatment included 
5 cycles of plasmapheresis (PLEX) and maraviroc.  Testing (date not reported) included a leukocyte count of 
10.26/nL, absolute lymphocyte count of 3.68/nL, and relative lymphocyte count of 38.5% (reference ranges not 
provided).
Update 02 Jul 2015:  Biogen considers this case to be confirmed for PML based on positive CSF and consistent 
MRI.
