This case concerned a 39 year old male on TYSABRI (300 mg, IV, QM) x 29 infusions, from 22 May 2012 to 14 
Nov 2014. His MS was diagnosed in Mar 2011 and he was previously treated with Avonex from 01 Jul 2011- 21 
May 2012; he has no history of prior immunosuppression. On 04 Jul 2012, he tested serum anti-JCV Ab positive. 
Baseline EDSS prior to Tysabri was 1.0 in 2010 and 2.5 in Feb 2012. Other history includes smoking, chronic 
anxiety, GERD, and social alcohol use; he was employed as an ambulance driver. A baseline brain MRI performed 
on 30 Apr 2014 noted a slight increase in the left cerebellar peduncle lesion, and two new punctiform images with 
uptake in the internal capsule of the right arm. The rest of the exam was unchanged. Relevant lab results from 30 
May 2014 included WBC of 7800 u/ml, relative lymphocyte count was 50%, and absolute lymphocyte count was 
2900 u/ml. The patient presented in Aug 2014 with new symptoms: pain, ataxia & tremor in upper left and lower 
right extremity; EDSS at this time was 2.5. Brain MRI in Aug 2014 described several Gd-enhancing lesions (NOS).

He was treated as an outpatient with Solumedrol 1000 mg 1 vial of 1 g of drinkable solution daily after a meal for 5 
days for presumptive MS relapse. Patient improved enough to return to work but was left with residual. Brain MRI 
on 28 Oct 2014 found, when compared to the test from April of 2014, using the same technique, the same lesions 
were observed along with three new lesions: in the posterior right portion of the bulb, the anterior portion of the 
brainstem and right thalamus. The new brainstem lesion demonstrated uptake of gadolinium, as well as two 
previous uptakes of middle left cerebellar peduncle and right occipital white matter. At the time of the study, all MRI 
findings were attributed to MS and supported therapy switch to Lemtrada. On (b) (6)  he received his 29th 
and final Tysabri infusion; post infusion during regular follow up, he complained of significant new LUE coordination 
problems with uncontrolled LUE clonic movements and manipulative clumsiness in the left hand, in addition to left-
sided thrusting, dysphagia with liquids, and major fatigue over the last few weeks; EDSS was 3.5. He was 
hospitalized for these symptoms which at the time were attributed to MS. He received another course of steroids 
and was considered to have ?very aggressive disease?, with Tysabri treatment failure prompting Tysabri therapy 
discontinuation in favor of Lemtrada. The patient was electively hospitalized again from (b) (6)  to (b) (6)  
(b) (6)  in order to receive Lemtrada. Lemtrada was administered as an inpatient (12 mg/day) for 5 days in 
accordance with standard protocol from (b) (6)  to (b) (6)  and was well tolerated with only transient 
skin rash. CBC was performed upon admission; however results were not provided. On 22 Jan 2015, the patient 
presented again with spastic paraparesis, gait difficulties, and fatigue. He was treated as an outpatient with 
Solumedrol 1000 mg 1 vial of 1 g of drinkable solution daily, and then hospitalized on (b) (6)  for suspected 
PML. CSF for JCV PCR obtained on (b) (6)  returned negative from a local lab ((b) (6) );
the LOD for this assay is <10 copies/ ml. Relevant lab results on (b) (6)  included WBC of 5400 u/ml, relative 
lymphocyte count was 6%, and absolute lymphocyte count was 300 u/ml; lymphocyte subsets were not performed. 
PLEX was commenced on (b) (6)  with 5 sessions total ending on (b) (6)  Additional therapy included 
corticosteroids and mirtazapine. Repeat MRI on (b) (6)  noted the previous lesions in protuberance, left 
cerebellar peduncle and right occipital white substance, where contrast nodular uptakes were already observed, 
which in principle, was suggestive of a primary possibility of demyelinating lesions with inflammatory activity. On the
other side, cortical and subcortical conditions were observed at both frontal lobes, in the right motor area and the 
left motor paramedian regions, which were not previously observed, and additional right capsulotomy, all which did 
not have a clear mass effect or uptake of contrast. Taking the clinical history into account, this was considered as 
compatible with PML. A follow up MRI on 17 Feb 2015 was unchanged. A second CSF sampling for JCV PCR 
obtained on 24 Feb 2015 returned positive at 42 copies/ ml from the same local lab ((b) (6) ).
PML diagnosed and attributed to Tysabri, with onset in retrospect on or before October 2014 based on 
reclassification of frontal lesions on October 2014 MRI. The patient failed to improve; rather he continued to 
progress clinically. As of 09 Mar 2015 he was described as having difficulty speaking, a bulbar condition, 
tetraplegia, need for continuous respiratory monitoring and IV fluid; however he remained cognitively intact. The 
neurologist described his condition as fatal in the short term, given the rapid progression with respiratory 
involvement. On (b) (6)  the patient expired. According to the neurologist, the fundamental cause of the

patient's death was PML, but the immediate cause was respiratory failure. An autopsy was not performed. Biogen 
Idec considers this case confirmed for PML on 19 Mar 2015 based on clinical presentation, CSF positive for JCV, 
and presence of radiographic evidence.
Update 19 Mar 2015: Additional information was provided by the neurologist. Additional lymphocyte count data 
were provided: Leukocytes count was 13000 on 17 Nov 2014, 9500 on 01 Dec 2014, 4300 on 09 Jan 2015, 6800 
on 15 Jan 2015, 5400 on (b) (6)  6400 on (b) (6)  4900 on (b) (6)  4000 on (b) (6) , 4000 on
25 Feb 2015 and 8700 on 05 Mar 2015; lymphocytes count was 19.6% on 17 Nov 2014, 44% on 01 Dec 2014, 9% 
on 09 Jan 2015, 11.90% on 15 Jan 2015, 6% on (b) (6)  7% on 07 Feb 2015, 9% on (b) (6) , 8% on (b)(6)  
(b) (6)  8% on 25 Feb 2015 and 5.4% on 05 Mar 2015; total lymphocytes count was 2548 on 17 Nov 2014, 4180
on 01 Dec 2014, 387 on 09 Jan 2015, 809 on 15 Jan 2015, 324 on 30 Jan 2015, 448 on 07 Feb 2015, 441 on (b)(6)  
(b) (6)  320 on (b) (6) , 320 on 25 Feb 2015 and 470 on 05 Mar 2015. The index values of the STARTIFY 
test on July 4, 2012 were not available. The patient died on (b) (6)  at 23:00 hr. The doctor who certified 
the death stated: The immediate cause of death was cardiac arrest due to respiratory failure; the fundamental 
cause was the PML, the doctor indicated MS in other processes and also reported that no autopsy was granted. 
The patient's clinical history states: Difficulty breathing in the previous week, without radiological pneumonia, with 
fever and cough, adequate oxygen saturation, antibiotics and empirical bronchodilator treatment were 
administrated; the respiratory distress had increased in the last days. It was agreed a conservative treatment with 
the family.
Update 29 May 2015: Upon follow-up, the neurologist informed that his standard of care for this kind of patient is to 
perform MRIs every 3 months (this was a STRATIFY positive patient with more than 2 years with TYSABRI). This 
standard of care was not possible with this patient because he was a claustrophobic patient. Therefore the 
frequency of MRI monitoring during TYSABRI therapy was every 6 months for this patient. The antibody index value
of the STRATIFY test performed on an unknown date was 0.41.
