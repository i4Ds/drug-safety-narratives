This spontaneous report was received from a physician via a Questcor sales representative. A 17-year-old male 
initiated subcutaneous H.P. Acthar Gel (Acthar) 80 units twice weekly on 20-Apr-2014 for the treatment of nephrotic
syndrome. Medical history included steroid dependent nephrotic syndrome. Concomitant medications consisted of 
prednisone, vitamin D, lisinopril, and cyclosporin. 
On an unspecified date in 2014, the patient believed Acthar was not helping and the patient "had a relapse" and 
decided to stop taking Acthar on 19-Jun-2014. Of note, the physician believed the issue was that the patient was 
non-compliant. Treatment included included mycophenolate mofetil and rituximab. Acthar remains discontinued.
