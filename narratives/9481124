Medically Significant
A physician spontaneously reported that a 39 year old female patient on TYSABRI (300 mg, IV, QM) for Multiple 
Sclerosis and for a duration of 4 years from an unknown date to an unknown date experienced suspicion of PML 
(onset unknown). No medical history of concomitant medication was reported. The patient tested positive with 
Stratify JCV in 2011. The suspicion of PML is based upon suspected lesion subcortical left frontoparietal detected 
on a routine MRI performed on an unknown date. The patient did not have clinical symptoms. The findings (on 
slices of the MRI) prompted further investigation; a lumbar puncture (LP) is scheduled for 26 Jun 2013 and CSF 
samples will be sent to(b) (6)  laboratory for JCV testing. The complete MRI is under review for a second opinion by
the (b) (6)  The outcome for the event suspicion of PML is unknown. The causality for the event of suspicion of 
PML is unknown.  It is unknown if TYSABRI treatment is ongoing.

Upadte 26 Jun 2013: Additional information including MRI read was received from the physician at the (b) (6)  MRI 
evaluation: it concerns a very small lesion in white matter, focal. This lesion has grown 2 to 3 mm over the past few 
months. The aspect of the lesion does raise suspicion for PML, especially since patient did not show disease 
activity over the course of the last 4 years while using TYSABRI. The lumbar puncture was completed and CSF 
sent to (b) (6)  on 26 Jun 2013. The physician intended to await results of (b) (6)  prior to start plasmapheresis.
Update 02 Jul 2013: The physician reported that the results (b) (6)  CSF testing (collected 26 Jun 2013) had 
returned negative for JCV. It was further reported that another LP was performed on 04 July 2013 (just before 
patient went on a holiday) and was sent to (b) (6)  for JCV testing the same day. Remaining liquor from both LPs 
will be sent to (b) (6)  for further analysis. It was decided that the patient will not receive plasmapheresis.
Update 11 Jul 2013: Results for the second CSF JCV DNA testing (collected on 04 Jul 2013) performed at (b) (6)  
returned negative. The (b) (6)  results is still pending.
Update 12 Jul 2013: Results for JCV DNA testing performed on CSF (collected on 26 Jun 2013) also returned 
negative from (b) (6)
Update 25 Jul 2013: The neurologist reported that there is progression of a lesion (onset unknown) [on MRI] and a 
new LP will be scheduled to be sent to (b) (6)  and (b) (6) . Results for the second LP/CSF JCV testing at (b) (6)  was 
still pending.
Update 30 Jul 2013: The neurologist reported that the results for (b) (6)  JCV PCR testing on CSF (collected on 04 Jul 
2013), had returned negative for JCV DNA. The neurologist reported that the patient is asymptomatic but lesion has
increased on MRI (images are undergoing expert review). The new LP will be performed on 30 Jul 2013 and CSF 
samples will also be sent to (b) (6)  and (b) (6)  for further JCV analysis and local lab ((b) (6) ) to look for CSF 
antibodies (compared to serum). The neurologist is considering plasmapheresis but will wait after discussing it with 
neurologist at (b) (6)
Update 08 Aug 2013: The neurologist reported that results for (b) (6)  CSF JCV testing (collected on 30 Jul 2013) 
had returned negative.
Update 16 Aug 2013: Additional information was received from the neurologist. Results for (b) (6)  CSF PCR JCV 
testing returned positive at 24 copies per/ml. PML was considered confirmed in CSF.  No antibodies were detected 
in liquor (local result (b) (6) ). An MRI on 12 Aug 2013 showed a further increase of T2 hyperintensities without 
enhancement after contrast. In the last week the patient developed problems with speaking and walking. The 
neurologist planned to initiate methylprednisolone therapy on the day of reporting.

Update 20 Aug 2013: Upon internal review,  this case was considered to be confirmed for PML based on positive 
CSF and positive MRI.
Update 10 Nov 2013: Additional information was received from the neurologist via a MS Standardized PML Data 
Collection Tool. The neurologist assessed the patient s estimated Karnofsky and EDSS scores in May 2009 to be 
80 (normal activity with effort; some signs or symptoms of disease) and 3.5. The patient tested positive for anti-JCV
antibody status on 11 Oct 2011. The neurologist assessed her estimated Karnofsky and EDSS scores on an 
unspecified date in 2011 to be 90 (able to carry on normal activity; minor signs or symptoms of disease) and 2.0. 
The neurologist assessed the estimated Karnofsky and EDSS scores in Jul 2013 to be 90 and 2.0. The neurologist 
provided the results of multiple MRIs as follows: 
24 May 2013: MRI brain = Compared with 11 Mar 2013. Dubious new lesion in medial part of right hippocampus.
24 Jun 2013: MRI = Sagittal FLAIR. No new lesions. Three lesions left more intense/somewhat larger, although 
small lesions can fit PML.
23 Jul 2013: MRI brain = Increased subcortical lesions left frontoparietal, suspect for PML.
12 Aug 2013: MRI brain = Further increase in subcortical lesions left frontoparietal with extension to sub insular 
region. Also, new subcortical lesion frontal right. Image suspect for PML.
19 Aug 2013: MRI brain = Further increase in subcortical deviations frontoparietal left. Light progression subcortical
lesion frontal right and an increase of lesions periventricular parasagittal both sides frontal.
26 Aug 2013: MRI brain = Increased enhancement in both hemispheres, left more than right, in accordance with 
PML.
02 Sep 2013: MRI brain = Increase in enhancements both sides, both point shaped as well as ring shaped left 
temporally. Also increase of focal lesion left parietal.
09 Sep 2013: MRI brain = Increased size in white matter lesion. Subcortical high parietal left. Decreased 
Gadolinium enhancement of known lesions.
16 Sep 2013: MRI brain = On FLAIR - images white matter deviations and expansion stable compared to 09 Sep 
2013. Enhancements are more intense in some places, especially left subcortical parietal. Suspicion on new 
enhancing point-shaped areas scattered subcortical both right and left. DD: coupe [sic] thickness and somewhat 
different location of the slices.
23 Sep 2013: MRI brain = almost identical image as 16 Sep 2013. Left parietal light decrease enhancement in 
hyperintense area. No new deviations.
30 Sep 2013: MRI brain = Again increased enhancement in known areas. Image resembles 02 Sep 2013.
07 Oct 2013: MRI cerebrum = Compared with multiple previous examinations. Slim ventricle system. Extensive MS 
plaques with enhancement. On T2 images unchanged aspect of plaques. After Gd administration extensive 
enhancement punctate as well as left of plaques. No new enhancing lesions. Also degree of enhancement has 
been more of less conform. Compared to 30 Sep 2013, no changes at all.
14 Oct 2013: MRI brain = Currently no longer enhancement in largest hyperintense area on left side. Some

scattered point-shaped enhancements. On T2 and PD, no change compared with 07 Oct 2013.
21 Oct 2013: MRI brain = Compared with 14 Oct 2010 and previous examinations. Completely identical aspect as 
on 14 Oct 2013.
04 Nov 2013: MRI brain = Severe increase in number of enhancing lesions in comparison with previous 
examination and more or less corresponding to Sep of this year.
Currently, the patient is alive and is residing at home. The outcome of the event of PML was unknown. Causality for
the event was assessed as related to TYSABRI.
Update 16 Mar 2014: Additional information was received from the neurologist via a MS Standardized PML Data 
Collection Tool. The patient is alive, residing at home, and is currently on fingolimod (Gilenya) (start date 19 Mar 
2014) for MS therapy. A brain MRI was last performed on 13 Mar 2014 (results not provided). The neurologist 
assessed the patient s estimated Karnofsky and EDSS scores on 10 Mar 2014 to be 80 (normal activity with effort;
some signs or symptoms of disease) and 3.0. The patient was diagnosed with IRIS, determined by clinical 
symptoms and MRI findings. Focal motor (right arm weakness) and speech (dysarthria) symptoms were noted with 
an onset date of Aug 2013. The patient received methylprednisolone 1000 mg IV seven times for three days (21 
days total). The patient has recovered from PML and IRIS. Causality for the events was assessed as related to 
TYSABRI.
Update 15 Apr 2014: A report was received via a literature article Wattjes MP, Vennegoor A,  Mostert J. et al: 
Diagnosis of asymptomatic natalizumab-associated PML: are we between a rock and a hard place? J Neurol; 06 
Apr 2014. Case 3. The author reported that the 39 year old female patient, who was diagnosed with relapsing MS 
13 years before, had started to use TYSABRI n May 2009 after treatment failure of interferon-beta-1a, 
immunoglobulins and methylprednisolone. Her EDSS at that time was 3.5. IIn Nov 2011, the STRATIFY JCV test 
(b) (6)  Denmark) was positive for antibodies against the JCV. After 48 months of treatment, during which the 
disease activity completely stabilized, a routinely performed brain MRI according to the local surveillance program 
showed two new small T2 lesions  (3 mm in size) in the subcortical white matter of the left frontal lobe that might be
suggestive of PML. She had no new clinical symptoms suggestive of PML at that time and her EDSS was 2.0. 
TYSABRI was immediately discontinued without additional IA or plasmapheresis (PLEX). The qPCR for JCV DNA 
in the CSF was negative two times at the (b) (6)  and the (b) (6)  laboratory (no dates reported). A brain MRI 1 month 
(date unspecified) later showed a slight increase in size of the T2 lesions further supporting our suspicion of PML - 
a typical MRI pattern of PML lesion progression with progressive involvement of the cortical gray but particularly in 
subcortical white matter including diffuse demyelination. A third CSF sample was obtained (no date) and the qPCR 
with negative results at the (b) (6)  and our local laboratory. The qPCR analysis in the (b) (6)  laboratory (no date) was
initially inconclusive. After a second analysis 1 week later a positive qPCR result (24 copies/ml JCV DNA) was 
reported. During follow-up the patient developed an PML-IRIS which was treated with steroids. Five months after 
the beginning of the PML-IRIS the patient had a MS relapse (onset unknown; post TYSABRI discontinuation at PML

onset). Treatment with fingolimod was started. Her current EDSS is 3.0. No causality or event outcome was 
reported. No further information was provided.
The author concluded that in patients presenting with small new focal MRI lesions without lesion characteristics that
clearly differentiate between new MS and PML lesions as shown in Case 3, we are entering a dangerous territory of
diagnostic uncertainty. In summary, this case series demonstrates the diagnostic dilemmas and uncertainties in the
diagnostic process of asymptomatic natalizumab-associated PML cases particularly when dealing with inconclusive
or negative results of JCV DNA in the CSF. The report stresses the need for dedicated PML diagnostic criteria for 
natalizumab treated MS patients.
Update 28 Sep 2014: Additional information was received from the neurologist via a MS Standardized PML Data 
Collection Tool. The patient is alive, residing at home, and is currently on Gilenya (fingolimod) for MS therapy due 
to clinical relapse. The neurologist assessed the patient s estimated Karnofsky and EDSS scores on 10 Jun 2014 
to be 80 (normal activity with effort; some signs or symptoms of disease) and 2.0. A brain MRI was performed on 
27 May 2014 (results not provided). The patient has recovered from PML and IRIS. Causality for the event of PML 
to TYSABRI was not provided. Causality for the event of IRIS was assessed as related to TYSABRI.
Update 24 Jun 2015: Follow-up information was received from the prescribing neurologist. The female patient had 
been diagnosed with natalizumab associated PML/IRIS in the summer of 2013. In the beginning of 2014, patient 
experienced an MS relapse and fingolimod was started in Mar 2014. In Feb 2015 patient experienced epileptic 
seizure, probably based on the PML scar. There were no signs of reoccurring PML on MRI. The patient stopped 
fingolimod in Mar 2015 (after hearing about a patient having PML on fingolimod without risk factors). Routine scan 
(presume MRI) in mid-Jun 2015 showed atypical coloring right parietal. There were no clinical symptoms. The scan 
has been sent to (b) (6)  with a differential diagnosis of MS lesion; PML/IRIS not ruled out. Follow up scan was 
planned for the next week.
Update 05 Jul 2015:  MRI was suspicious for PML. It has been ruled out by MRI assessments now. Diagnosis is 
MS disease activity which fits with stopping Fingolimod. MRI assessments from (b) (6)
MRI on 22 June 2015: Change to MRI of 03 Mar 2015: unchanged aspect to the ventricle system and the periferal 
liquor spaces met clear distinction between grey/white matter. Several contrast coloring laesions, right parietal, right
frontal, left frontal (juxtacortical and periventricular) in white matter. First thought was recurring disease activity. 
Laesion right parietal however shows atypcial aspect with infiltrative growth in cortical grey matter. An opportunistic 
infection cannot be ruled out, but does not seem very likely. Conclusion: probably MS activity, however because of 
PML history a follow-up MRI within a month is recommended.

distinction between grey/white matter. Known lesions right parietal, right frontal, left frontal (juxtacortical and 
periventricular) in white matter. The intensity of the colored laesions is decreasing, leasion left frontal in 
periventricular white matter doesn't show pathological coloring. No other active T2 lesions. Conclusion: First 
thought is MS activity, no arguments for opportunistic infection/ PML-IRIS
Update 24 Aug 2015: Additional information was received from the neurologist via a MS Standardized PML Data 
Collection Tool. The patient was alive, residing at home and not on any therapy for MS. The neurologist assessed 
the patient s estimated Karnofsky and EDSS scores in Jul 2015 to be 90 (able to carry on normal activity; minor 
signs or symptoms of disease) and 2.0, respectively. The most recent brain MRI was performed on 30 Jun 2015 
(results not provided). In Jul 2015 the patient was assessed as recovered from PML and IRIS. Causality for the 
events was assessed as related to TYSABRI.
