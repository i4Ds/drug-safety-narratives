This resort was received from an investiator refers to a 11 year old male patient enrolled 
Hepatocellular carcinoma diagnoses on a un nown date in December 2009 with primary site of disease at neck 
(as reported), was enrolled in the above mentioned study and commenced protocol therapy on CI Day minus one 
(21-AUG-2011) with cefpodoxime (the protocol defines the start of protocol therapy as the initiation of cefixime), 
Cefpodoxime was administered to the subject beginning on 21-AUG-2011 as required by protocol. This was not 
considered an Investigational medicinal product and is administered in attempt to prevent irinotecan-associated 
diarrhea. With the approval of the study chair, cefixime was replaced by cefpodoxime since the subject's insurance 
did not cover cefixime. The subject began the chemotherapy (initiation of treatment with temozolomide, 
temsirotimus and irinotecan) on 23-AUG-2011 (C1 D1 ). Temsirolimus was given at 35 mg/m2/dose IV over 30 
minutes on Days 1 & 8 (Cycle=: 21 Days; max=: 12 months). trinotecan was given at 50 mg/m2, Days 1-5, (Cycle=: 
21 Days; max=: 12 months). The oral temozolomide was given at 100 mg/m2, Days 1-5, (Cycle=: 21 Days; max=: 
12 months). The last dose of temsirclimus was on 16-SEP-2011 (Cycle 2, Day 1) with total administered dose for 
this course of 38.5mg, and the last doses of irinotecan and temozotomide were on 20-SEP-2011 (Cycle 2, Day 5) 
with total administered doses for this course of 275mg and 550mg respectively. Medical history included an episode 
of elevated transaminases on 10-AUG-2011 with AST 2011, ALT 987, and Alk Phos 799. However, by 19Aug2011, 
the subject's LFTs were markedly improved without intervention: AL T 104, AST 87, and Alk Phos 480. Baseline 
performance status at initiation of protocol was ECOG/Zubrod scale 0, As per the investigator, since the subject 
was transferred to the investigators institution in August 2011, the subject has always had a grade 1 transaminase 
elevation. Additional history included left hepatectomy in December 2009, hypertension, activated partial 
thromboplastin time (aPTI) G1, elevated blood lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) G 1, low white blood cell count (WBC) 
G1, anemia and dysesthesia G1. Past product history included single agent (oral sorafenib) from January 2010 to 
January 2011; and multiple agent chemotherapy (gemcitabine, oxaliplatin and bevacizumab (AVASTIN)) from 
February 2011 to July 2011. The subject developed malignant hypertension, likely from AVASTIN and the decision 
was made to substitute vinorelbine for AVASTIN. The subject developed larungeal dysesthesia with oxaliplatin. The 
last dose of gemcitabine and oxaliplatin was 27Jul2011 as reported and confirmed. Concomitant medications 
included sulfamethoxazole/ trimethoprim (BACTRIM) 1 single strength tab by mouth twice a day on Friday, 
Saturday and Sunday for PCP prophylaxis, oxycodone HCL (OXYCONTIN) 10mg by mouth every 12 hours for pain,

aminotransferase, and alkaline phosphatase after the completion of Cycle 1 on 12-SEP-2011. The subject was 
unable to start 02 due 
to elevated LFTs which included AST 84, ALT 184, Alk Phos 526 on 12-SEP-2011 (no units provided). Labs were 
repeated on 13-SEP-2011 and included AST 58, ALT 123, AlkPhos 462 and although improved, his ALT remained 
too elevated to proceed with C2. Subject returned on 16-SEP-2011, and LFTs were repeated and included AST 53, 
AL T 75, and Alk Phos 464,; all of which were within eligibility criteria. He continued with Cycle 2 of investigational 
treatment and received C2, day 1 therapy on 16-SEP-2011, Subject began complaining of abdominal pain on 21-
SEP-2011, which improved by the afternoon on 22-SEP-2011 after taking ranitidine (ZANTAC) x 1 and oxycodone

non-serious events. On the evening of the subject was referred to the emergency department for

administered due to elevated LFTs (alanine aminotransferase Increased rade 3, alkaline phosphatase increased 
grade 3, aspartate aminotransferase increased grade 4; with onset of and persistent abdominal 
pains. Cycle 3 was also held due to elevated transaminases and abdominal pains. ubject had CT of chest, 
abdomen, and pelvis performed on 04-OCT-2011 far disease evaluation which showed a stable tumor burden, but 
- new development of small pleural effusions (abdomen/pelvis) and mild mesenteric edema (ascites grade 1 and 
abdominal pain grade 1 ). On 08-OCT-2011, the subject developed grade 1 testicular pain and continued to have 
left testicular swelling/pain on 09-OCT-2011 (grade 2). On 11-OCT-2011, subject presented for scheduled 
outpatient visit and complained of increased abdominal pain and intermittent left testicular swelling. However he 
denied dysuria, hesitancy, and testicular pain. Abdominal and testicular exam were benign at this time, except for 
some mild tenderness over the left spermatic cord. Subject was sent home on oxycontin. Subject then presented to 
clinic on 13-OCT-2011 with worsening abdominal pain and reported Intermittent swelling of left testicle, which 
appeared to get bigger as abdominal pain worsened. Abdominal X-ray showed constipation, but no obstruction. 
Subject sent home on lactulose, and constipation resolved within 24 hours, Subject then presented to ER on 15-
OCT-2011 with abdominal pain and left testicular swelling (AE testicular disorder grade 2). Abdominal ultrasound 
was negative, testicular sonogram was consistent with left epididymitis, small left hydrocele, small left varicocele, 
testicularpain grade 2. Pain temporarily improved, and the subject was sent home. On (Cycle 2, Day 
the subject presented to the clinic with complaints of persistent abdominal pain (grade 3) whit was no longer 
leved with oral narcotics, diarrhea related to lactuolose (now discontinued), and ongoing Intermittent swelling of 
his left testicle over the past week (per parents) though normal today. Subject denied complaints of dysuria or 
hesitancy. Subject was afebrile and had no vomiting. Subject hospitalized for abdominal pain management and 
investigation of cause of worsening abdominal pain. As of (C2 D33) Cycle 3, continued to be postponed 
due to persistently elevated LFTs. On the su sect's total bilirubin was 1.7 mg/dL (reference range: 
0.3-1.3 mg/dL) as compared to a pre-s u total bilirubin of 0.1 mg/dL on 16-AUG-2011. His total bilirubin continued 
to Increase steadily and was 3.2 on and 5.6 (grade 3) on On 411111. an MR1 of 
the liver was suggestive of Budd-Chlarl syndrome with poor visualization of hepatic veins and narrowing of the 
intrahepatic inferior vena cava (IVC). 
On 1111111111, the subject's total bilirubin rose to 8.3 mg/dl, and alanine aminotransferase grade 3 was 123 
(range 7-41 U/L), and alkaline phosphatase remained as grade 3. Alanine aminotransferase increased grade 3 was 
recovered to baseline (grade 1) on AL T toxicity resolved o since it had been entered 
as pre-existing condition G1. There are no additional serious criteria for these even s. 
Elevated LFTs (AST and Alk Phos) which met non hematolo ical DL T criteria, did not resolve to baseline within 21 
days of the planned start of the next treatment cycle. On the subject underwent hepatic vein and IVC

Case Comment: 
Blood bilirubin increased, Testicular disorder, Testicular pain, Alkaline phosphatase increased, Ascites are unlisted 
in the IB for temsirolimus and irinotecan and are unrelated per Company assessment. 
This 11 year old boy was post status liver transplant for hepatocellular carcinoma. Clinical picture and diagnostics 
are suggestive of a budd chiari syndrome post liver transplant. Therefore, the events are related to the progression 
of disease under study (relapsed or recurrent hepatocellular carcinoma) in association with complications of liver 
transplant. The event of testicular pain is secondary to epididymitis, left hydrocele and varicocele (testicular 
disorder) and both are unrelated to the study drugs temsirolimus and irinotecan. Follow up information provided NCI 
causality assessment. The previous company causality assessment remains unaltered. The Company is not the 
sponsor of the clinical trial and it is not the Marketing Authorization Holder for product temozolornide; causality for 
product temozolomide remains as indicated by the investigator/sponsor. The impacts of this report on the 
benefit/risk profile of the product and on the conduct of the study are evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for 
safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern 
identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory 
Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate. 
Additional information is been expected.
