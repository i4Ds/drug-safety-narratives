Medically Significant
A neurologist reported that a  male patient, currently 39 years old,  on TYSABRI (300 mg, IV, QM) for an unknown 
indication from 2009 to unknown date is currently hospitalized ((b) (6) ) due to PML infection c/b 
psychosyndrome (onset Mar 2013). The outcome for the event PML infection c/b psychosyndrome is unknown.  It 
is unknown if TYSABRI treatment is ongoing. An MRI examination (date unk),  according to the treating physician, 
is  characteristic for PML. A CSF sample  (date unk)was taken for JCV DNA testing (results pending). The PML 
diagnosis was done by the treating physician based on the clinical symptoms and MRI examination. Current 
therapy for the event:is  plasmapheresis. Cuurently the  patient is feeling slightly better. The patient is hospitalized. 
Concomitant medications, previous immunosuppresant therapy and medical history were not reported. Causality

Update 04 Apr 2013:The neurologist  reported the quantity of detected JC-Virus DNA by PCR in the local
laboratory  is 94 copies/ ml.
Update 18 Apr 2013:The neurologist reported the  result of the test for JCV DNA in the liquor performed by (b) (6)
laboratories, USA, is negative (discrepant from the local lab's CSF JCV results).
Update 15 May 2013: The physician reported the patient's history of MS started in  Dec 2008 when the patient
experienced double vision with spontaneous remission. In Apr 2009, the patient experienced severe ataxia with 
EDSS 8, MRI, LP (lumbar puncture) were done. Despite 2 methylprednisolone treatment courses no improvement; 
5x PLEX (plasma exchange), IVIG, 6 weeks rehabilitation and EDSS changed to 5. In  May 2009,  the patient 
started  TYSABRI as first line treatment till Nov 2012. The patient had no clinic visits until Nov 2012 whereby the 
JCV-serostatus was unknown. 21 Mar 2013 was the last  TYSABRI infusion. On (b) (6)  the patient was 
hospitalized for behavioral changes, deterioration of ataxia and , increasing hemiparesis on the left side. The EDSS
 was 7. On (b)(6)  to 
(b) (6)  the patient underwent PLEX five times and from (b) (6)  to (b) (6)  the patient 
received 1 gram  of methylprednisolone with oral taper. The patient had an improvement of hemiparesis and ataxia.
The EDSS was 5.5  In mid  (b) (6)  the patient experienced renewed deterioration;  EDSS 7. On (b) (6)  the 
patient started  URBASON (methylprednisolone) 1 gram  treatment. From (b) (6)  to (b) (6)  the patient 
underwent PLEX five times.
Update 15 Oct 2013: Additional information received from the physician reported that the patients EDSS in Jun 
2013 was 8.5 and in Oct 2013 was 7.0.
Update 22 Jan 2014: Additional information received from the neurologist reported that the patient was admitted to 
the ICU due to respiratory syndrome. No additional information was available.
Update 03 Apr 2014: Additional information was received from the neurologist in the form of MRI images. 
Interpretations of the MRI were not provided. The CSF which returned positive 94copies/mL from the local lab and 
negative from (b) (6)  were obtained from the same spinal tap. The patient had no prior MS therapy as TYSABRI 
was started as a first line MS therapy.
Update 10 Apr 2014: Biogen Idec considers this case to be confirmed for PML based on positive CSF, MRI 
findings, and clinical symptoms.

Collection Tool. The patient had a negative HIV test result on an unknown date. In Feb 2013, the patient had a 
positive blood JCV DNA result. Serum anti-JCV antibody status was positive in (b) (6)  The patient?s estimated 
Karnofsky and EDSS scores, respectively, were assessed as follows: on 01 May 2009 to be 80 (normal activity with
effort; some signs or symptoms of disease) and 4.0; on 01 Dec 2012 to be 80 and 3.0; on 25 Mar 2013 to be 40 
(disabled; requires special care and assistance) and 6.0; and on 07 Feb 2014 to be 40 and 8.5. No additional 
lumbar punctures have been performed. Currently, the patient is residing in a nursing home and has not recovered 
from PML. Causality for the event was assessed as related to TYSABRI.
Update 09 Oct 2014:  Additional information was received from the treating neurologist.  According to this 
neurologist, the 50 year old (age discrepant) male patient is in a nursing home in a vegetative state (coma vigil)

Update 11 May 2015: Follow-up information was received from the neurologist. The patient was isolated due to

from his wife.
Update 12 May 2015: Additional information was received from the treating neurologist via a Standardized MS PML
Data Collection Tool. The patient is alive and residing at a nursing home and is not currently on therapy for Multiple 
Sclerosis. The neurologist assessed the patient's estimated Karnofsky and EDSS scores on 11 May 2015 to be 40 
(disabled; requires special case and assistance) and 9.5.  The date of the most recent brain MRI was not provided. 
As of 11 May 2015, the patient has not recovered from the events of PML and IRIS.  Causality for the events of

Update 29 May 2015: Follow-up information was received from a physician. The frequency of MRI monitoring was
