Casanova B, et al. Lipid-specific IgM bands in CSF associated with a reduced risk of developing PML during 
treatment with natalizumab. Ann Neurol. 2015 Jan 7. doi: 10.1002/ana.24345. [Epub ahead of print]. The authors 
explored whether the presence of lipid-specific IgM oligoclonal bands in CSF (IgM bands), a recognized marker of 
highly inflammatory MS, may identify individuals better able to counteract the potential immunosuppressive effect of
TYSABRI and hence be associated with a reduced risk of developing PML. Twenty four MS patients who developed
PML and 343 patients who did not suffer this opportunistic infection during TYSABRI treatment were studied. All 
patients diagnosed with PML showed MRI findings suggestive of PML and a positive ultrasensitive quantitative PCR
for JC virus in CSF. Twenty of them also showed progressive symptoms characteristic of PML. Patients were

treated with TYSABRI for 2.77 years (SD +/- 1.58 years). Twenty two out of twenty four patients experienced 
immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS). Results: IgM bands independently associated with decreased
PML risk (OR = 45.9, 95% CI: 5.9-339.3, p<0.0001) in patients treated with TYSABRI. They also associated with 
significantly higher CSF CD4, CD8 and B cell numbers. Patients positive for IgM bands and anti JC antibodies had 
similar level of reduced PML risk than those anti JC negative (OR = 1.55, 95% CI: 0.09-25.2, p=1.0). The higher 
risk was observed in patients positive for anti JC antibodies and negative for IgM bands (19% of the total cohort, 
OR=59.71, CI: 13.6-262.2). Interpretation: The presence of IgM bands reflects a process which may diminish the 
risk of PML by counteracting the excess of immunosuppression that may occur during TYSABRI therapy. This case
refers to a female patient who experienced PML (onset unknown) and IRIS (onset unknown). The outcome of the 
events is unknown. TYSABRI therapy was discontinued. No further patient specific information was provided.
