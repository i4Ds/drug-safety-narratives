Case Report
Events: Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, Positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of John 
Cunningham virus, Immunological reconstitution phenomena
The patient, diagnosed with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in 1978 and stable under hydroxychloroquine, 
presented in October 2012 with arthritis, rash, thrombopenia, and anemia. Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) 1500 mg 
twice daily (bid) and prednisone 10 mg were introduced. In January 2013, her SLE was still active. Belimumab was 
started with a good clinical response. In July 2013, she presented with a 3-week history of fatigue, apathy, and 
aphasia. Biological investigations were normal. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed large confluent 
white matter hyperintensities. A positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of John Cunningham virus in the patient 
s cerebrospinal fluid confirmed the diagnosis of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML). After 
interruption of all immunosuppressive medication, we observed an initial neurological deterioration, probably 
explained by the immunological reconstitution phenomena. A second MRI showed increased diffuse white matter 
edema. During the third week, the patient progressively got better. One year later, a moderate aphasia and 
executive function deficits still persist, rendering her unable to lead an independent life.
Authors' Comments
SLE itself and immunosuppressive agents, including MMF, could have predisposed this patient to PML, but 
because of the temporal evolution, we believe that belimumab was the principal contributor.
