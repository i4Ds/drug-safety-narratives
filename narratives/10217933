Medically Significant
A neurologist spontaneously reported that a 42 year old female patient on TYSABRI (300 mg, IV, QM) for Multiple 
Sclerosis from Jan 2009 to Oct 2013 and from 22 Apr 2014 to 22 Apr 2014 was hospitalized from an unknown date 
to an unknown date for PML suspicion characterized by aphasia, bilateral orbita pain, tonic-clonic seizure, and 
behavioral disorders (onset (b) (6) ). The patient was tested positive for anti JCV antibodies with an index 
value at 2.842 in Oct 2013. The patient started Gilenya (fingolimod) in Jan 2014 and stopped in Feb 2014 since she
was presented with clinical symptoms: transient episode of aphasia (lack of words, many circumlocutions), bilateral 
orbital pain. These symptoms appeared progressively, then improved (NOS). On 23 Feb 2014 the patient 
experienced general tonic-clonic seizure, then another one in a few days (by the end of Feb 2014) with absence 
lasting 1 hour. Zonegran (zonisamide) was initiated presumably for general tonic-clonic seizure. In Mar 2014 she 
experienced behavior disorders (apathy, disinterest in his daughter, judgment disorders) and consequently 
underwent MRI which showed new hypersignals in corpus callosum, suspect rather for MS than for PML. These 
symptoms were treated as MS relapse with Solumderol (methylprednisolone) in bolus. The patient experienced 
slight clinical improvement. On (b) (6)  she was re-hospitalized for behavior disorders worsening. On(b) (6)  
(b) (6)  she underwent new MRI and TYSABRI was re-introduced on the same day with only one infusion received. 
The MRI was analyzed after TYSABRI infusion, it was discovered left insular sub-cortical extended lesion, 
suspected for PML, with blurred contours, Gd negative. On the same MRI frontal and parietal bilateral punctiform 
Gd positive lesions were also seen. On (b) (6)  the patient was transferred in bigger hospital for further 
investigations. No new findings were observed from the brain MRI on (b) (6)  Lumbar puncture was done on 
(b) (6)  and local JCV [DNA] PCR was tested negative. The patient had received 5 plasmatic exchanges since
28 May 2014. The patient's clinical status is stable now and had no IRIS signs at the moment. The event of PML 
suspicion characterized by aphasia, bilateral orbita pain, tonic-clonic seizure, and behavioral disorders is ongoing. 
The causality for the event of PML suspicion c/b aphasia, bilateral orbita pain, tonic-clonic seizure, and behavioral 
disorders was assessed as related.  TYSABRI therapy was discontinued and the patient was planned to switch to 
Gilenya (fingolimod). French Imputability C2S1I1.
Update 28 May 2014: Past medication included  beta-1a interferon since 2002 for RRMS. A brain MRI was 
performed in July 2013 (result not provided). After TYSABRI was discontinued in Oct 2013, Gilenya  (fingolimod) 
was initiated on 13 Jan 2014. Anti-JCV antibody index value was 2.842 in Oct 2013. At the end of Feb 2014, the 
patient experienced regressive blurred vision and orbital pain. In Mar 2014, the patient experienced 2 general tonic-
clonic seizures (previously reported) and presented with behavior disorders (disinterest, apathy) and aphasia with 
circumlocutions. The patient's PML improved with levetiracetam and IV Solumderol (methylprednisolone). A new 
brain MRI on the first week in May 2014 revealed frontal and parietal punctiform GD+ lesions. Non Gd+-enhanced 
T2 hypersignals in the subcortical area were also noticed. ADC (Apparent diffusion coefficient) increased. A new 
MRI was performed 20 days after the previous MRI (May 2014) but no information was available. French

FOIA Case Report Information
Update 16 Jun 2014: The neurologist reported that the patient was re-admitted to the hospital on an unknown date 
due to worsening aphasia and seizure. A new lumbar puncture was performed and CSF will be sent to (b) (6)  for 
JCV detection. French Imputability: C2S1I1.
Update 23 Jul 2014: The neurologist spontaneously reported that the patient presented aphasia, some cognitive 
disorders and depressive syndrome but was clinically stable and had returned home at the time of this report. MRI 
performed 3 weeks ago (presumed Jul 2014) showed no change. PML was confirmed as CSF JCV DNA was 
detected at 75 copies/ml at(b) (6)  on 13 Jun 2014. Treatment included intravenous corticosteroids (previously 
reported as Solumderol) introduced 3 weeks prior to this report. French Imputability: C2S2I2.
Update 24 Jul 2014:Upon internal review, this case was confirmed for PML based on positive MRI, positive CSF 
and clinical symptoms.
Update 19 Nov 2014: Additional information was provided via a Standard PML Data Collection form (month 3). The 
patient was currently alive and residing at home at the time of this report. No lumbar puncture had been performed 
since the last request for information. The patient was tested positive on 13 Oct 2013 for anti JCV antibodies with 
index value of 2.842. Testing for HIV on 01 Sep 2014 was negative and for anti natalizumab antibodies on 01 Sep 
2014 was negative. The patient had not been diagnosed with IRIS. At the time of last assessment on 02 Oct 2014, 
the event PML was ongoing. French Imputability: C2 S2 I2
