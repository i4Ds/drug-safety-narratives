This clinical trial cas concerns a 68 year old male patient of 
unknown origin. The patient's mediad history was not provided. Concomitant medication included: folic acid, 
vitamin 512, dexamethasone, domperidone maleate, ranitidine hydrochloride, ipratropium bromide, nadroparin 
calcium, acetylcysteine, perio-aid mouth wash as prophylatics, terramycin for eye infection, minocycline for rash 
and, total paranteral nutrition for anorexia. On 07-Apr-2010 the patient first received pemetrexed 500mg/m2 and 
cisplatin 75mg/m2 on day one every 21 days, and cetuximab with a loading dose of 400mg/m2 on day one of cycle 
one, then 250mg/m2 weekly; all administered intravenously for the treatment of squamous cell carcinoma of the 
head and neck. Last dose of pemetrexed and cisplatin received prior to the event was on 27-Jul-2010 and last dose 
of cetuximab received prior to the event was on 02-Aug-2010. Laboratory results from 02-Aug-2010 included 
hematocrit 26.1 % (40- 50), haemoglobin 8.9 g/dl (13- 17), erythrocyte 2.90 10E12/1(4.4- 5.5), red cell distribution 
width (RDW) 19 % (11.6- 14.6), thrombocytes 136 10E9/1 (140- 440), urea 123 mgldl (17- 49), sodium 134 mmo1/1 
(136- 145), potassium 3.1 mmo1/1(3.5- 5.1), calcium 6.9 mg/di (8.6- 10.2), magnesium 1.0 mg/dl (1.6- 2.6) and C-
reactive protein (CRP) 3.4 mg/di (<0.3). On 411111.10 01.d ays after the last dose of pemetrexed and 
cisplatin and the day after the last dose of cetuximab, the patient was hospitalised for an unspecified reason 
however the patient had been experiencing recurrent episodes of aspiration (not reported as SAE). He was treated 
in the geriatric ward of the hospital. Laboratory results from included urea 158 mg/di, creatinine 1.2 
mg/d1(0,66- 1.25), sodium 131 mmo1/1, potassium 2.5 mmoliI, magnesium 1.1 mg/d1, CRP 24.4 mg/di, haemoglobin 
7.40 dl, thrombocytes 32,0 10E9/1, leucocytes 0.390 10E9/1(3.450- 9.760) and neutrophils 27 % (40.2- 74.7). On 
the patient was moved to another hospital where he received unspecified corrective treatment. The 
same day, on ID days after receiving last dose of pemetrexed and cisplatin and alidays after 
receiving last dose of cetuximab, the patient developed life-threatening septic shock and died. The site of infection 
was reported to be the lung. On an autopsy was performed, findings included status following total 
laryngectomy, thoracic wall and diaphragm adhered to the right lung, nodule measuring 4- 5 cm in the right lower 
lobe, probably a metastases, diffuse atherosclerosis with critical narrowing of the.  coronary arteries and with signs of 
ischemia in the myocardium, a questionable old infarction in the inferior wall of the ventricle, very severe 
atherosclerosis throughout the thoracic and abdominal aorta with infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm of 3- 4 cm, 
signs of  o is congestion and nephroangiosclerosis. On a microscopy was performed which 
confirmed findings of macroscopy: there was an old infarction in the left ventricular wall, the nodule in the lung 
consisted of necrotic tumor tissue with only shades of tumor cell nests identifiable and no clear viable tumor tissue 
visualised, in the adjacent lung tissue and also other lobes there were atelectasis and foci of incipient 
0  0 00 eumonia, in the kidney there were signs of acute tubular necrosis and of status following tubular 
necrosis, there were also signs of haematuria. The cause of death from the autopsy result was epicrisis, with the 
underlying cause of death metastatic laryngeal cancer and the direct cause of death respiratory failure. The patient 
had not recovered from the life threatening septic shock at the time of death. All three study drugs were continuing 
at the time of patient's death. The reporting investigator stated that the fatal event of respiratory failure and the life 
threatening event of septic shock were related to pemetrexed and cisplatin because of neutropenia and

thromocytopenia and added the patient had recurrent episodes of aspiration. There was no reasonable possibility 
of relatedness to cetuximab or protocol procedures. This case is linked with the following case: 8E201007000289 
and 8E201 e a  248. Update 11-Mar-2011: Additional information received from the investigator on 10-Mar- 
2011: Relatedness for cetuximab and protocol procedures provided; patient was hospitalised prior to the septic 
o for unreported reason; site of infection was lung. Relevant fields and narrative updated. Update 17-Mar- 
2011: Additional information received from the investigator on 15-Mar-2011. Added autopsy results, microscopy 
results, and I tory results, and autopsy cause of death. Case and narrative updated. Update 25-Mar-2011: 
Additional information received from the investigator on 21-Mar-2011. Added additional fatal event of respiratory 
failure and investigator confirmed cause of death should be updated from septic shock to respiratory failure as per 
autopsy results. Case and narrative updated. Update 09-May-2011: additional information received on 06-May-
2011; serious criterion life-threatening was added to septic shock. Narrative and relevant fields updated. Edit 08-
Mar-2012: Additionatinformation received on 08-Mar-2012 from data management (LSS Change Request). 
Investigator confirmed that the event of septic shock was not the primary cause of death and was not associated 
with a fatal outcome. Removed fatal serious criteria for event of septic shock, reassessed expectedness and 
updated narrative accordingly. The fact that the primary cause of death was respiratory failure was previously 
present in the case.
