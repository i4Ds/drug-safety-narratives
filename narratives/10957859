Case number# PHEH2015US005023, is an initial spontaneous report from a consumer (patient) via other 
pharmaceutical company (Sanofi Aventis) received on 13 Mar 2015 with a follow up report received from a 
physician on 03 Apr 2015.
This report refers to a 26 year old female patient. The patient had no medical history of HIV, Malignancy, transplant 
or any other immunosuppressive condition. In Dec 2010, the patient presented with ataxia and MRI showed an 
enhancing right middle cerebellar peduncle focus and other non enhancing foci consistent with relapsing remitting 
multiple sclerosis (RRMS). Prior MS therapy included, Rebif (interferon beta 1A) from Jan 2011 to May 2011 and 
was stopped due to injection site reactions. Concomitant medications included baclofen (manufacturer unknown), 
clonazepam (manufacturer unknown), gabapentin (manufacturer unknown), meloxicam (manufacturer unknown) 
and Vit D (manufacturer unknown). On 02 Mar 2011, absolute lymphocyte count was 2.3 x 10 E9/ul.

FOIA Case Report Information
The patient Gilenya (fingolimod) capsule for RRMS (relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis) from Jun 2011 at an 
unspecified dose and frequency (route of administration was unknown).
In May 2012, an MRI showed one new MS plaque not present on prior MRI. JCV Ab test was positive in 2012 (JC 
virus test positive). Titer was not available. HIV test was negative on 30 Jul 2012. On 27 Jan 2014, absolute 
lymphocyte count was 0.5 x 10 E9/ul. On 29 Jan 2014, brain MRI showed several lesions not present in 2012 
including 2 enhancing foci, one 18 mm in right frontal lobe associated with some mass effect (possible tumefactive 
lesion) (central nervous system lesion). Based on the MRI final diagnosis was provided as aggressive RRMS 
(relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis) with tumefactive lesion. Despite aggressive MS, symptoms were mild 
numbness and ataxia at different times. On 10 Mar 2014, brain MRI showed large right frontal lesion no longer 
enhanced nor had mass effect and was smaller compared to prior MRI.
On 08 Dec 2014, brain MRI showed 5 Gd enhancing lesions. Gilenya was discontinued due to breakthrough 
disease and the patient was switched to Tecfidera in Jan 2015. On Dec 2014, JCV antibody test was positive with 
titer of 0.44. No JCV DNA PCR test in CSF was done, as there was no suspicion of PML at any point. On 16 Dec 
2014, absolute lymphocyte count was 1.0 x 10 E9/ul. The patient received corticosteroids for 3 to 5 days at various 
time points in Jan/Feb 2014, Dec 2014, Jan 2015 and Mar 2015.
On 20 Feb 2015, brain MRI showed new clumsiness exacerbation and cervical spine MRI showed 03 small 
enhancing foci prompting decision to switch off Tecfidera. On 23 Mar 2015, brain MRI showed seven enhancing 
lesions. The patient was started on Lamtrada on 24 Mar 2015 and it is ongoing at the time of this report.
The outcome and seriousness of the events were not reported. Seriousness assessment of the event relapsing 
remitting multiple sclerosis was upgraded (medically significant) based on NVS IME list. Seriousness assessment 
of the event central nervous system lesion and JC virus test positive was upgraded (medically significant) based on 
information available in the source document. Causality between relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis and Gilenya 
was classified as uncertain by the reporting physician and causality for other events was not reported.
Follow up report received from a physician on 03 Apr 2015: Added medical history, historical drug, patient age, 
concomitant medications, suspect drug details (start, indication and stop date), event RRMS and details, lab value 
and reporter comment.
