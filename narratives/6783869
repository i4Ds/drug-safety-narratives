with fluids and less so with solids. He denied odynophagia and had no acute weight changes. The patient 
generally felt- that food got stuck in his throat. Labs were: he 0. o  (F .  OV)) 9.5, hernatoorit OHO) 28.3, platelets

nitrogen 19, creatinine OM and glucose 180. Urinalysis was positive for protein and a000. A chest x-ray showed 
new left lower lobe infiltrate suspicious for pneumonia with new right upper lobe infiltrate, which may be due to prior 
radiation therapy; increase in mediastinal mass compared with previous study. An electre gram showed 
sinus tachycardia, rate 118 and no ischernic changes. The patient received moxilloxacin and blood cultures were 
obtained (were negative . hospital course). He continued to spike temperatures up to 104. His antibiotic 
coverage was changed to vancomycin and pipercillinttazobactum. He received two units of blood early in the 
*spit . '0.  secondary to a drop in his hematocrit. After seven days of treatment, it was discovered that the 
pneumonia was likely secondary to a rather large tracheo-esophageal fistula (TEE) , which was found by swallow 
esaluatlokenzadmit. Early in his hospitalization,an es ageal steel placed. However, it was later determined

ttiOsersient was also considered. He was maintained on broad-spectrum an '0 .0 '0... He received fentanyi 
mss, h e e 9   and morphine for pain management. His pain was 0.0  trolled. The patient was 
won red dose inhalers and started on low dose IV steroids due to his in '   to swallow. His 
irkeitiiradory status was stable throughout hospitalization except for the   ' lions from pneumonia. He 
developed explosive diarrhea in the setting of recurrent fevers. His clostridium difficile toxin was negative. He 
received rnetronidazole for one week. The diarrhea resolved. He was maintained on subcutaneous heparin and 
had stet*, otatelets. The patient had a Do Not Resuscitate/ Do Not Intubate order. He continued to have low-
grade fevers in the context of microaspiratiori. He was started on esomeprazole for reflux and was maintained on 
seine for secretions. Onallilla he was transferred to another facility for placement of a tracheal stent. On 
the patient underwent a bronchoscopy and esophagogas  G. nescopy. A mass was noted just 
iikthe canna and TEE present at the canna. Due to the presence of the gross tumor at the trachea, no 
surgical was done, as he was a non-operative candidate. It was noted the patient had evidence of 
pneumonkis and pleural effusions. He was to continue his current chemotherapy treatment. He was transferred 
back to the original admitting hospital. On labs were: WBC 8, Hgb 10 and pit 719. The patient 
recovered from the event of pneumonia and was discharged home. In mid December, he had an increase in his 
cough, which was productive for contents quite consistent with contents of his PEG tube. On allialledays 
after last receiving pemetrexed, the patient was admitted to the hospital for aspiration  e     onia. Chest 
radiography and echocardiogram revealed that the patient had patchy infiltrates and the recurrent aspiration 
pneumonia was secondary to the TEF's. Per a hernatology/oncology consult, it was felt the patient's stomach 
contents Were rising into the TEE and then into the lung. He had a barium liquid study to check for reflux in his 
PEG tube and this was . He was diagnosed with community-acquired aspiration pneumonia. He was 
started on vancornycin and pipercillinitazobactum. The patient had a sputum culture which grew pseudornonas

The events did not result in permanent discontinuation of the study drug- In the  a  a'  '  of the investigator, the 
event of pneumonia was related to study drug and the event of tracheo-esphogeatistula was not related to study 
drug, both events were considered not related to protocol procedures. The assessment of relatedness for the
