A registered nurse reported that a 56 year old female patient on TYSABRI (300 mg, IV, QM) for Multiple Sclerosis 
from 16 Oct 2006 to 04 Apr 2008 and from 11 Feb 2011 to 24 Apr 2014 and enrolled in a Biogen Idec sponsored 
marketing program of Monitored Therapy was hospitalized from an unknown date to an unknown date for PML 
(onset Apr 2014). At the time of this report, TOUCH dosing database indicated that the patient received a total dose
of 62 infusions from 16 Oct 2006 to 24 Apr 2014. The nurse noted that the patient was asymptomatic and her PML 
was diagnosed in Apr 2014 (a few days post infusion dated 24 Apr 2014). Lab testing included positive anti JCV 
antibodies in Oct 2013. Treatment included pheresis for PML. The event of PML is ongoing. The causality for the 
event of PML was assessed as related.  TYSABRI therapy was discontinued.
Update 29 May 2014: During an outbound call, a health care professional reported that the patient was hospitalized 
to receive PLEX for PML. The patient was asymptomatic and used a walker at baseline for ambulation. Past 
medication included Rituxan (rituximab) for an unknown period of time in Dec 2009. Anti JCV antibodies were 
tested positive in Jun 2012 and on 24 Apr 2014. MS was diagnosed in Aug 1990. No further information was 
provided.
Update 02 Jun 2014: In responding to an outbound call, a registered nurse confirmed that the patient was 
diagnosed with PML and treated approximately 3-4 weeks ago. The patient was asymptomatic and PML was 
suspected based on routine surveillance brain MRI, which the neuro-radiologist thought was consistent with PML. 
The patient had lumbar puncture and received PLEX. At the time of this report, the patient was at home and was 
experiencing IRIS (onset unknown). Treatment included weekly steroids (not specified) infusion for 8 weeks. 
According to the nurse, the patient was doing well. She was alert, oriented and ambulatory. No further information 
was provided.
Update 04 Jun 2014: Additional information was provided via medical record. The patient was diagnosed with MS in
1990. Medical history included mononucleosis in the past. Her sister has type 1 diabetes mellitus. Several family 
members have autoimmune thryoid disease. Previous medications included Betaseron (interferon), Copaxone 
(glatiramer) and Rituxan (rituximab). The patient started TYSABRI in 2006 and stopped in 2008 and restarted in 
2001 and stopped on 24 Apr 2014. The patient was diagnosed with secondary progessive MS since she went from 
using a cane intermittently to using a walker 2 years ago while on TYSABRI. She was reported to have a low 
positive JCV [DNA] titer and positive JCV antibodies in Nov 2013 with an index of 0.45. JCV antibody index value of
Apr 2014 was 2.19. JCV DNA from lumbar puncture was positive (8179 copies/ml). She had MRI in Nov 2013 but 
the result was not provided. MRI on (b) (6)  showed new, confluent areas of T2 signals with faint

enhancement in the right frontal white matter concerning for PML and she was admitted for further evaluation. She 
had had mild increased fatigue but no new symptoms otherwise.  She fell (onset unknown) once at home and was 
on the floor for several hours. She started being treated with PLEX for 5 days from (b) (6)  IVIG (intravenous 
immunoglobulin) from 03 May 2014 and Solu Medrol (methylprednisolone) from 03 May 2014 and maraviroc from 
03 May 2014. MRI on 05 May 2014 showed less enhancement. The patient experienced IRIS characterized by 
slowly progressive cognitive decline 3 weeks after being diagnosed with probable PML and was hospitalized on (b)(6)  
(b) (6)  and discharged on an unknown date to rehabiliation. MRI on (b) (6)  showed enlarging frontal lobe 
lesions consistent with PML/IRIS with some subtle enhancement in several lesions. Other than cognitive slowing, 
she denied any new neurological symptoms. Significant physical examination findings on (b) (6)  included the 
patient was awake and alert but cognitively slow and mildly inattentive. Her spontaneous language was normal but 
she had difficulty with clock drawing, figure copying and trails. Repetition was impaired because of inattention. She 
was able to remember 3/5 memory items. She scored 17/30 on Montreal congnitive assessment. Since the patient 
was discharged, she had been clinical stable without evidence for progression of IRIS or PML and her cognition 
had improved but slightly slow. The patient stopped the treatment Keppra (levetiracetam) but continued on IVIG, 
Solu Medrol and maraviroc at the time of this report.
Update 10 Jun 2014: A consumer reported via a program of Monitored Therapy that the patient was hospitalized on
(b) (6)  and diagnosed with PML characterized by "had a tough time mentally and physically" and short term 
memory issues (onset 2014). The reported stated that on (b) (6) , the patient could not get down the stairs 
and was subsequently admitted to the hospital. Treatment included a total blood transfer. The reporter noted that 
the patient had been in and out of the hospital over the last six weeks. Outcome for the event was reported as not 
recovered. Causality of the events in relation to TYSABRI was not assessed by the reporter. No further information 
was provided. 
Update 12 Jun 2014: Upon internal review, this case has been confirmed for PML based on positive radiologic 
findings on MRI and positive JCV DNA in CSF.
Update 19 Jun 2014: The same consumer re-reported that the patient had PML (onset (b) (6) ). The patient was 
diagnosed by a MRI in (b) (6)  and is currently in the hospital. According to the consumer, the patient is confused 
and has lost some mobility (presumed to be symptoms of PML). Outcome for the event was reported as not 
recovered. Causality of the events in relation to TYSABRI was not assessed by the reporter. No further information 
was provided. 
Update 05 Aug 2014: Additional information was received from a neurologist via a MS Standardized PML Data 
Collection Tool, diagnostic reports, and clinic notes. The patient is alive. A final diagnostic imaging report of the 
brain MRI from 22 Nov 2013 was received, with results reported as follows: stable demyelinating lesions without

enhancement to suggest activity nor development of new lesion. A final diagnostic imaging report of the brain MRI 
from (b) (6)  was received, with results reported as follows: extensive new findings compared to Nov 2013 
including two area of right frontal and one right thalamic area of FLAIR hyperintensity with small areas of patchy 
enhancement, and with numerous small white matter foci of enhancement which may follow vascular spaces. 
Differential diagnosis includes PML, lymphoma, or possibly other infection.  Note is made of diffuse T2 
hyperintensity/ mild T1 hypointensity of the superior colliculus which is unchanged compared to Nov 2013, likely 
due to chronic demyelination. Cerebellar atrophy appears new compared to Nov 2013. The patient was diagnosed 
with IRIS based on clinical symptoms and MRI findings.  Clinical symptoms of IRIS included cognitive/ behavioral 
(cognitive decline) and motor (increased BLE spasticity) symptoms with an onset date of 10 May 2014. The patient 
received corticosteroids pre- and post- IRIS onset. The outcome of the events of PML and IRIS was reported as 
unknown. Causality of the events of PML and IRIS with relation to TYSABRI was not assessed by the reporter.
