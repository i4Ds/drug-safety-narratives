Medically Significant
A neurologist spontaneously reported via a Biogen Idec representative that a 41 year old male patient on TYSABRI 
(300 mg, IV, QM) for relapsing remitting Multiple Sclerosis from 21 Apr 2011 to 25 Jul 2014 experienced PML 
suspected (onset 30 Jul 2014).  Past medical history included Multiple Sclerosis diagnosed on an unknown date. 
Previous MS therapy included beta interferon. Testing included the patient testing positive for anti-JCV antibodies 
on 01 Dec 2011. A brain MRI on 21 Jan 2014 was normal. A routine brain MRI on 30 Jul 2014 revealed the 
following: a new left frontal Gd-subcortical lesion with blurred contours was found, seen in FLAIR and diffusion 
sequences, very suggestive for PML, not present in previous MRI performed on 21 Jan 14. The neurologist noted 
that brain MRIs were scheduled for every 3 months, but the patient missed the brain MRI scheduled in Apr 2014.  A
clinical examination of the patient revealed a motor deficiency of the right upper limb and also of the lower limbs, 
which had appeared 4 months earlier and was first considered to be related to probable SPMS.  The patient was

treated with corticosteroids (NOS) that led to some improvement. For "a few time" (NOS), the motor deficiency 
(right hemiparesis) was worsening. The patient also presented with slight cognitive disorders (NOS). The PML 
suspicion was first only based on MRI findings, before the neurologist finally stated that right hemiparesis could also
be related to possible PML. A lumbar puncture is scheduled for 01 Aug 2014 (for JCV PCR testing by (b) (6) ). 
Treatment with PLEX is also planned for next week. The event of PML suspected is ongoing. Causality for the 
event is unknown.  TYSABRI therapy was discontinued. French Imputability: C2S2I2
Update 13 Aug 2014: Additional information reported by the treating neurologist included the (b) (6)  JCV PCR 
result on CSF was negative. No other information was provided. French Imputability : C2S2I2
Update 18 Aug 2014: The neurologist reported additional information regarding this case. The patient first 
experienced signs of multiple sclerosis in Jun 2010 and MS was diagnosed in July 2010. MS symptoms prior to 
PML suspicion included cerebellar signs with cerebellar dysarthria in Jun 2010, paraparesis from 2011 resulting in 
an ambulation perimeter of 800 m, 4 limbs hypopallesthesia mainly affecting the lower limbs, from 2011 and some 
dysuria from 2011. Previous MS treatment included Rebif (interferon beta-1a) from Jul 2010 to Mar 2011.
Karnofski score, assessed on Jan 2011, prior starting TYSABRI was 70.  EDSS score, in Mar 2011, prior starting 
TYSABRI was 4.0.  TYSABRI therapy was started on 21 Apr 2011 and taken to 25 Jul 2014 with no interruptions in 
therapy.  EDSS in Jan 2014, prior to PML suspicion was 6.0 and Karnofski score was 70. Clinical symptoms that 
prompted PML investigation was a right brachial paresis (onset date not provided). Brain MRI done on 30th July 
2014 revealed a new sub-cortical FLAIR and diffusion hypersignal, non Gadolinium enhanced, with blurred limits, in
left frontal area, PML suggestive. Clinical status evaluated at the beginning of Aug 2014 included a pronounced 
paraparesis with an important spasticity, a pronounced cerebellar syndrome, a complete motor deficit of right hand, 
hypopallesthesia in 4 limbs mainly in lower limbs, some rare episodes of dysuria, and a normal visual acuity.  At the
time of PML suspicion in Aug 2014, EDSS was 6.0 to 6.5 and Karnofski score was 60. CSF, collected on 01 Aug 
2014, was negative for JCV DNA PCR testing by (b) (6)  laboratories, protein was 0.38 g/l, glucose was 3.6 
mmol/l, there were 2 leucocytes and 4 red blood cells. As corrective treatment, the patient underwent 5 sessions of 
plasmatic exchanges (on 02, 04, 06, 08 and 10 Aug 2014) and has not received any drug.  At the time of this report,
the patient was living at home with no special need for support; no IRIS has occurred.  According to the neurologist,
PML diagnosis was confirmed. No other information was provided.  French Imputability: C2S2I2.
Update 19 Aug 2014: The neurologist reported that he was contacted by the patient on 18 Aug 2014 who did not 
feel well. The patient was at home for 1 week and then hospitalization on (b) (6)  was finally decided by the

neurologist to monitor patient's clinical status. Brain MRI was scheduled for September 2014 but could be moved 
forward in case of worsening of patient's condition.  French Imputability: C1S1I1
Update 20 Aug 2014: The neurologist reported that the patient did not feel well. A clinical exam was performed on 
(b) (6)  but the results were not provided. The neurologist did not determine whether the patient experienced 
PML or beginning of IRIS. A MRI will be scheduled soon.  French Imputability: C1S1I1
Update 27 Aug 2014: The neurologist reported slight clinical worsening (increasing paresis in right arm and leg, 
progressive hypoesthesia since May 2014) and MRI worsening (unknown date) after PLEX (slight lesion extension, 
new punctiform Gd+ lesions, very PML suggestive). The patient has undergone 7 plasma exchanges since 01 Aug 
2014. Samples from LP on 01 Aug 2014 were sent to(b) (6)  for JCV PCR test. On 01 Aug 2014, CSF tested for 
herpes serology was negative. The patient received 40 TYSABRI infusions in total. French Imputability C2S2I2.
Update 08 Sep 2014: The neurologist reported that the patient was diagnosed with IRIS last week. Brain MRI 
performed on an unknown date showed Gadolinium enhancement. Clinical symptoms worsened as the patient was 
found to suffer from paraplegia. Corticosteroid therapy (NOS) was initiated on 08 Sep 2014. CSF samples were 
sent to(b) (6)  (NOS). No further information was provided. French Imputability: C2S2I2
Update 12 Sep 2014: The neurologist reported, via a Biogen Idec employee that the patient's condition worsened 
and the patient presented with dysarthria in addition to right hemiparesia as well as sphincter disorders. CSF 
sample that were sent to (b) (6)  came back negative on 12 Sep 2014. No oral corticosteroid therapy was planned 
after the boluses. French Imputability: C2S2I2.
Update 22 Sep 2014: The neurologist reported, via a Biogen Idec employee, that the patient was planned to be 
discharged home on 23 Sep 2014 with nursing care as he is hemiplegic and nearly aphasic. He has had 3 
Solumedrol (methylprednisolone) courses on 05, 06 and 07 Sep 2014 which were not followed by oral therapy. The 
patient is planned to consult the neurologist on 13 Oct 2014 for clinical examination and brain MRI. According to the
neurologist, the patient will not undergo a second lumbar puncture. No further information was provided. French
