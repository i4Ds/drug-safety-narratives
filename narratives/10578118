AER 1487396, is an interventional study case that was received on 07/Nov/2014 from an investigator. It concerns a
female patient ((b) (6) ) (unspecified age) who developed neurological symptoms, suspected PML (Progressive 
Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy) whilst enrolled in (b) (6)
(b) (6)
No concurrent conditions, concomitant medications or past drugs were reported. Her medical history included no 
HIV, no bone marrow or solid bone transplant, no herpes simplex, no herpes zoster, no history of  opportunistic 
Infections, no CMV pneumocystic carinii pneumonia and her immunodeficiency was unknown, chronic viral 
infections was unknown.
On 06/Jan/2011 she began therapy with intravenous infusions of bendamustine 280 mg every four weeks (180 
mg/m2, divided dose given on day 1 and 2 of a 28 day cycle, as per protocol). On 11/Jun/2011 she received her 
last dose of therapy with bendamustine. On 19/Sep/2011 she began therapy with intravenous infusions of rituximab
600mg (375 mg/m2, as per protocol) administered every four weeks. On 08/Sep/2014, she received her last dose 
of therapy with rituximab, prior to developing neurological symptoms, suspected PML. On (b) (6)  she was 
hospitalized due to hearing difficulties which had developed over the previous two weeks. She developed an 
infection (no details provided) approximately two weeks prior to the date of admission to the hospital; she had 
experienced chronic sinusitis, fever since two days from hospitalization and headaches. Approximately one and a 
half weeks prior to admission, she had been treated for tinnitus in an unspecified clinic (no details provided) due to 
aggravated hearing loss and several vertigo episodes, however without treatment success. Liquor cytology on 
(b) (6)  showed increased lymphocyte numbers without detection of oligoclonal bands. Later on an unspecified
date an intravenous cortisone acetate stoss therapy was performed , followed by an oral phasing out scheme. 
These measures led to slight Improvement of hearing. On (b) (6)  a cranial MRI without contrast agent 
showed supratentorial white matter lesions in both cerebral hemispheres. These however cannot be associated 
with any of her clinical symptoms. A repeated cranial MRI with and without contrast agent on (b) (6)  showed 
persistence of the white matter lesions without contrast enhancement. Upon consultation with her Oncologists it 
was decided to discontinue rituximab therapy; the patient received her last dose on (b) (6)  Though she was 
hospitalised at (b) (6)  the study site was informed about that at 06/Nov/2014. The event, neurological 
symptoms was the reason of hospitalisation but did not prolong it. On (b) (6)  serum diagnostics showed 
positive JC-virus titres, liquor cytology was not altered and lymphocytic pleocytosis persisted.  Taken together, a 
beginning PML was suspected. For further clarification and repeated diagnostics the patient was due to present to 
the clinic on 16/Dec/2014 to rule out PML. No signs of a relapse of the her known NHL (Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma),
granulomatous inflammation or cerebral lymphoma were seen. On an unspecified date, her pathological laboratory 
findings were: leucocytes count was 10.6 X 10^3/mcL (normal range: 4-10), absolute lymphocytes count was 4% 
(normal range: 25-40), Mean cell volume (MCV) was 95 fL (normal range: 80-94), absolute neutrophil count was 93
% (normal range: 50 -70), immunoglobulin G (IgG) was 558 mU/ml (normal range: <100), potassium was 3.4

mmol/l (normal range: 3.5- 5,0), liquor leucocytes was 10/mcL (normal range: <5), plasma albumin was 3630 mg/dl 
(normal range: 3700-5100), C-reactive protein (CRP) was 3.4 mg/dl (normal range: <1.0) and plasma IgG 681 
mg/dI  was (normal range: 700-1600); Details of laboratory tests such as brain biopsy, JC virus in CSF, IgM, CD20, 
CD8, CD4 were not reported. It was not reported regarding storage of the patient's serum sample that was drawn 
within the previous 5 years of event onset. On (b) (6)  she was discharged from the hospital with medications
cortisone 15 mg per day, esomeprazole (Nexium) 20 mg per day, pentoxifylline 1200 mg per day, 
dexpanthenol/sodium hyaluronate (Bepanthen eye) ointment 1 once a day, Hydro Gel twice a day. On (b) (6)
she was using hearing aid device and hospitalised on same day. On (b) (6)  renewed diagnostic imaging 
showed the known infratentorial lesions, lumbar puncture continued to show an inflammatory lymphocytic 
pleocytosis. On (b) (6)  she was discharged from hospital. On (b) (6)  she was hospitalized to perform 
plasmapheresis to reduce rituximab level, three plasmapheresis therapies were performed (plasma exchange of 3 
I) without complications. On (b) (6)  she was discharged. On (b) (6)  she was hospitalised again due to
impaired sensitivity and discreet paresis on left arm. The cerebrospinal fluid was found only low- positive for JC-
virus(form (b) (6)  JC virus DNA 77 k/ml) for JC virus DNA, most likely still due to long-standing rituximab 
therapy. The cranial imaging was performed: CT performed on (b) (6) 4 and MRI performed on (b) (6)
showed a discreet enlargement of the cortical and sub/juxtacortical lesion as compared to previous imaging from 
(b) (6)  On (b) (6)  MR of the cervical spine showed disc prolapse at vertebrae 5/6, yet without 
compression of myelon or nerve roots. Labs included B lymphocytes 2/ul (100-500), helper cells 254per ul(300-
400), leukocytes 10.3x 10^3, lymphocytes 17 percent (20-540), monocytes (optil) 11 percent (2-10), myelocytes 
(optil) 2 percent (0-1), neutrophils 77 percent (50-70), suppressor cells 60 percent of lymphocytes(10-30), EBV IgG 
149 U/ml(less than 50), VZV IgG 276 U/L(less than 100), ALT 62 U/I (less than 34), AST 63 U/I (less than 31), 
glucose 124 mg/dl(70-110), LDH 442 U/L (less than 247, cerebrospinal fluid: leukocytes 52/ul (0-5), plasma 
proteins: albumin 2580 mg/dl (3700-6100), CRP 1.4 mg/dl(less than 1), lg G 312 mg/dl(700-1600), IgM 24 
mg/dl(40-240). On (b) (6)  she was discharged. Discharge medication included esomeprazole 40 
mg/d(Nexium) and prednisolone 60 mg/d. On 14/Jan/2015, CSF cytometry did not show any tumor cells. Cortisone 
therapy lead to marked improvement in the cytology of cerebrospinal fluid. On (b) (6)  she was again 
hospitalized due to increasing weakness of the left arm and of both legs, rhythmical fasciculation of the abdominal 
wall and light headaches and was diagnosed with non-Hodgkins lymphoma(in regression), status post 
plasmapheresis, long standing therapy with rituximab in the past and positive JC virus. She had differential 
diagnosis with suspected progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, progressive tetraparesis of unknown origin 
and ataxia. On unknown date lumbar puncture was performed which revealed lymphocytic pleocytosis. On 
(b) (6)  c MRT was performed. On (b) (6)  ECG showed alpha-rhythm sparse, beta activity and diffuse 
deceleration, picture of a mild overall alteration, repeated single and grouped polymorphous steep waves while 
duplexsonography and c MRT revealed a thrombosis with complete obliteration of the vena jugularis on the right 
side. It was possible that the placement of a central catheter for the recent plasmapheresis was the cause. she 
received ful dose of heparin and subsequent oral anticoagulation with phenprocoumon (Marcumar). thereafter,

headaches subsided. On (b) (6)  CT scan of chest and abdomen was performed for search of tumor but 
found to be unremarkable. On an unknown date, her sate was deteriorated with worsening paresis and myoclonus 
of the abdominal wall. Additional diagnostic imaging MRI was performed for cervical and thoracic vertebral column 
and plexus brachialis which did not showed revelant pathologies. On (b) (6)  ECG showed irregular waves, 
moderate alpha rhythm with frequency of 9 per seconds with theta activity, reaction on visual blockage completed, 
repeated temporal and central theta and delta waves, alpha-EEG with transition to slight overall alteration, 
discontinuation focal impairment in  the right hemisphere temporal and central, rarely ETP s seen. Also follow up c 
MRT was performed which showed minimal changes. On (b) (6)  diagnostic imaging MRI was performed for 
cervical and thoracic vertebral column and plexus brachialis which did not showed revelant pathologies and 
neurography indicated bihemispheric damage and a complex severe nerve impairment with different affection of 
arm and leg. On (b) (6)  cytology of cerebrospinal fluid showed no correlation to increase cell count, only 
lymphocytic, non-activated cells, no lymphoma cells or meningiosis. On, (b) (6)  ECG showed alpha rhythm 
per second spares, right centrally repeated small steep waves which was not entirely configured as ETPs. MRI was
performed for cervical and thoracic vertebral column and plexus brachialis which did not showed revelant 
pathologies. On (b) (6)  MRI showed progressive parenchyma lesions, in particular on the right, in the frontal 
and periventricular and bilaterally in the fronto-parietal white matter. Along with symptoms and MRI alterations, it 
was observed that it was progressive leukocephalopathy and rituximab was not detectable hence therapy with 
mirtazapine was advised to be initiated. Due to rapid progression and  conclusive diagnosis she was transferred to 
neurological department of university hospital hamburg eppendorf. On (b) (6)  she was discharged from the 
hospital and treated with prednisolone 20mg/d, esomeprazole 20mg/d, furosemide 40mg/d and phenprocoumon 
according to physician. On (b) (6)  she was again hospitalized. On unspecified date, pathological laboratory 
parameters were performed as follows: Activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) 38 sec (normal range: 28-36), 
TSH basal 4.45 mU/I (0.30-4.20), B lymphocytes absolute 0 per mcg (100-500), T helper cells absolute 291 per ul 
(300-1400), leukocytes 10.9 10^3 per ul (4.0- 10.0), lymphocytes 18% (25-40), neutrophils 76% (50-70), suppressor
cells absolute 918 per ul (200-900), activated t lymphocytes 632 per ul (30-200), VZV IgG 610 mU/ml (<100), ALT 
79 u/l (<34), AST 51 u/l (35),  GGT 39 U/l (<38), glucose 117 mg/dl (70-110), potassium 3.2 mmol/l (3.5-5.0), LDH 
299 U/l (<247), cerebrospinal fluid leukocytes 53 per ul (0-5), plasma protein IgG 509 mg/dl (700-1600), plasma 
protein IgM 31 mg/dl (40-240). Later, she continued to show lymphocytic pleocytosis and CSF was positive for JC 
virus and suspicion of PML was diagnosed. FA CS analysis did not give hint of a hemato- oncologic disease. On an
unspecified date, PET-CT was performed to rule out the recurrence of NHL but did not give proof of any suspicious,
metabolically active lesions hence a relapse of NHL could not be ruled out. It was reported that rituximab level 
remained negative, hence plasmapheresis was not seen necessary. Oral cortisone therapy was tapered and a 
therapeutic attempt was made with intravenous immunoglobulins which caused a strong allergic reaction, so the 
therapy was discontinued. Later, prophylaxis with sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim (Cotrimoxazol) and aciclovir 
(Aciclovir) was commenced and tapering of cortisone did not improve immune status. It was reported that for leg 
spastics therapy with baclofen was initiated and hypokalemia was treated and phenprocoumon therapy was

continued due to status post sinus vein thrombosis. Later, spastic tetraparesis was worsened in further course with 
addition of reduced vigilance. On (b) (6)  following procedure were carried out during hospitalization: ergo 
therapy, oncological, medical-psychological, urological and gynecological evaluations. CSF showed sparse 
erythrocytes, no oligoclonal bands, lymphocytic pleocytosis, consistent with an inflammatory CNS process. On 
(b) (6)  c MRI  was performed  which showed progressive findings consistent with PML. It was reported that 
sinus vein thrombosis was improving. Therapy with levetiracetam (Keppra) and valproate sodium (Valproate) 
reduced her seizures. Overall< the evnt PML was progressive as there was no curative treatment she was 
transferred to hospice. On (b) (6)  she was discharged with aciclovir 1200mg per day, clindamycin 600 mg 
per day, emser salz 3 per day, esomeprazole 20mg per day, lactulose 15ml per day, levetiracetam 7 tablets per 
day, macrogol 3 sachets per day, mirtazapin 32 mg per day, phenprocoumon 1.5 mg per day, tizanidine 5 mg per 
day, valproate sodium 600 mg per day, sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim 260 mg twice a week, fentanyl patch every 
3rd day, zolpidem 10 mg, ibuprofen 60 mg as needed, lorazepam 0.5 mg as needed and macrogol as needed. On 
(b) (6)  she died. It was not reported whether autopsy was performed or not.
The reporting investigator assessed the patient's neurological symptoms, suspected PML, as related to therapy 
with bendamustine, reporting it to be a 'side effect of bendamustine', and unrelated to therapy with rituximab. No 
other causal relationships were reported.
