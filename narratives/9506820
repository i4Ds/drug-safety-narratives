Medically Significant
A registered nurse reported that a 33 year old male patient on TYSABRI (300 mg, IV, QM) for Multiple Sclerosis 
from 12 Mar 2012 to 22 Jul 2013 experienced suspected PML infection (onset Aug 2013).  The event of suspected 
PML infection is ongoing. The causality for the event of suspected PML infection is unknown.  TYSABRI therapy 
was discontinued. At the time of this report the TOUCH dosing  indicated the patient received  18 infusions of 
TYSABRI from  12 Mar 2012  to 22 Jul 2013.The patient reports stable MS for many months until he began to 
notice difficulty with pronunciation for one month. He felt like it took more effort to get the words out, and longer to 
think about it what words to say. This problem is intermittent. The patient underwent an MRI which was concerning 
for PML. The patient discontinued TYSABRI and was admitted on (b) (6)  for LP and further workup. He was 
already supposed to stop TYSABRI and switch to TECFIDERA this month. Medical records were provided on (b)(6)  
(b) (6) (b) (6)  and (b) (6)  that recorded the following:

The patient was diagnosed with MS in Jan, 2011, but he felt like he had symptoms since 2010. His initial symptoms
were Ihermitte?s sign and tingling. He developed R-sided weakness in January 2011 and was then hospitalized and
diagnosed with MS. He was started on AVONEX (interferon beta 1a) but continued to get flare-ups so he was taken
off it in Nov/Dec of 2011. In March of 2012, he was started on TYSABRI and he was doing well until now. In (b) (6)  
(b) (6)  the patient was JCV antibody positive. An MRI of the brain and cervical spine without IV contrast done on 26 
Aug 2013 revealed interval increase in disease burden including new T2 hyperintense lesions in the centrum semi-
ovale bilaterally. Right greater in number than left as well as the right periventricular region. Mildly increased size of 
the 80 lesion adjacent to the left ventricle. Interval appearance of a confluent subcortical focus of increased T2 
signal in a gyriform configuration involving the right frontal lobe. Finding was concerning for PML. The configuration 
of this makes demyelinating change from the MS less likely. Stable appearance demyelinating lesions cervical cord 
compared to 10 Aug 2012. An MRI of the brain on 18 Feb 2013 revealed no interval change; stable origin of 
demyelinating lesions. The patient has a history of mononucleosis, syncope and acne. The patient was JCV 
antibody positive in 15 Feb 2012, 26 Mar 2013 and Index-2.86. The patient takes Neupogen (filgrastim) injection, 
300mcg, SC, daily, Augmentin (amoxicillin-clavulante), Vitamin D3 and Vitamin B12. . The patient?s WBC count is 
20.52 (reference not provided). On(b) (6)  the CSF revealed protein 27.3 (7.0-35.0 mg/dl) and glucose 72 
(45-70 mg.dl).
Update 05 Sep 2013: The research nurse provided the following information via medical records.  CSF JCV DNA 
PCR returned positive at 126 copies/ ml from (b) (6)  Labs; the sample was drawn on 27 Aug 2013.
Update  10 Sep 2013: Biogen Idec considers this to be a confirmed case of PML.
Update 29 Jan 2014: In response to a request for follow up information, a research study manager from the 
neurologist?s office reported that the patient is alive, residing at home, and is not currently on any MS therapy. A 
brain MRI was performed on 12 Dec 2013 with results reported as follows: confluent areas of flair hyperintensity, 
areas of PML, in the bilateral cerebral hemispheres demonstrate slightly less flair hyperintensity and appear slightly 
less in extent. New areas of abnormal enhancement noted in the right cerebral hemisphere as well as small foci in 
the left frontal lobe. Findings compatible with PML-IRIS. Stable burden of demyelinating lesions in the cerebral 
hemispheres. The patient was diagnosed with IRIS (onset unknown) (MRI findings) and was treated with 
corticosteroids. The outcome of the events of PML and IRIS and causality to TYSABRI were not provided.
Update 12 Sep 2014: Information was received via a poster presented at the 2014 Joint Annual Meeting of the 
Americas Committee for Treatment and Research in Multiple Sclerosis (ACTRIMS) and the European Committee

J, Hernandez C, Muth C, Mercurio M, Javed A (September 2014). Fifteen non-fatal outcomes in natalizumab-
associated PML/IRIS: the effects of early diagnosis and evolving novel therapeutic approaches. The authors 
reported 15 patients with MS with PML occurring after 14-70 months of natalizumab treatments as well as 2 
additional PML patients in early phases of treatment and recovery. Patient (b)(6)  refers to this case. This patient was 
on TYSABRI x 1.15 years and previously on IFN. He presented with dysarthria in 2013, MRI revealed PML, 350 
JCV/CSF, no Plex.  IRIS developed at 7 weeks treated with filgrastim, maraviroc and IV corticoids. Recovery time 
was 8 weeks; protracted IRIS/MRI (12 weeks). Currently the EDSS is 2.0 and Karnofsky score  is 100; minimal 
change. The patient is employed. A corresponding abstract (P858) was published in the Multiple Sclerosis Journal
