C ' ,and:Bevacizurriab as Induction, Followed by Pemetrexed and Bevacizumab as Maintenance, in First-Line 
Treatment of Non squamous Advanced NSCLC. 
This phase 2 study explored efficacy and safety of 1st line induction pemetrexed (PEM) + cisplatin (CIS) + 
bevacizurnab (BEV) followed by maintenance PEM + BEV. 
Hundred and nine  ' Is were enrolled from 5 countries. Seventy two patients had maintenance chemotherapy. 
Patients with advanced non small celflung_cancer and ECOG 1 were planned to receive 4 cycles PEM 500 mg/m2, 
CIS 75 mg/m2 and :BEV 7.5.mg/kg once in. 3 week. in absence of - progreesive disease (P0) and with ECOG 0-1., 
patients could continue on-maintenance therapy with.Pem  o .mg/m2 and Bev 7.5 mg/kg givennvery 3 weeks, 
until PD or unacc. toxicity-. All patients received prophylactic oral dexamethasone, folic acid, and vitamin 
B12s Overall median(max)no of cycles were 6 (34) for PEM + BEV and 2 (4)for CIS. The primary 
was.progression free survival (PPS). secondary endpoint was overall survival (0$), response rate, toxicity. 
The most common grade 3/  AEs of any grade were nausea (grade 3 in 5 patients), ), fatigue (grade 3 in 13 
is and ay, 
 a  4 in 3 patients), constipation (grade 3 in 3 patients), neutropenia (grade 3 in 24 patients and

patients), anemia (grade 3 in 6 -  ' ; ts.and grade 4 in 1 patient), and (grade 3 in 3 patients arid 
grade 4 in 1 patient). The . e events of specialinterests included hypertension (grade 1 in 6 patients, grade 2 
in 10-patients and grade 3 ifl 6 .patients), " rbofic events (grade 3 in 1 patient and grade 4 in 2 patients),

patient), proteinuria. (grade 1 in 2 patients and grade 2 in 3 patients), Non-infectious wound complications (grade 2 
in 1 and. grade 2 in 1 patient, cardiac arrhythmia (grade 3 in 1 patient), cerebral ischemia (grade 3 in 1 
patient) and. at, ischemiafinfarction (grade 4 in 1 patient). Two patient died from study-drug related toxicity
