and the event, JC virus positive and C-reactive protein 42.1 mg/l (normal value: less than 5) were assessed as 
medically significant by the Company.
The patient's relevant medical history included approximately from 2010 already, the patient experienced signs of 
multiple sclerosis/deterioration described as falls, tingling in the arm and leg, back pain, loss of strength, dragging 
of one leg, weak dorsiflexion of the right foot, tiredness and at least one new focus in central nervous system 
discovered in MRI (magnetic resonance index) which led to three hospitalizations in 2013, prior to start of Rebif 
treatment. The patient had already sustained falls and noticed paraesthesia in the sense of formication in her right 
arm and right leg for several years before that. The patient had also occasionally had a headache. She had only 
had the symptoms for a short period of time before they disappeared again completely. In 2012, she developed 
severe back pain and began to drag her right leg. Overall her gait had become slower and she felt a marked loss of
muscle strength. The patient's general practitioner initially prescribed massages. In the course, she developed 
weakness of the dorsiflexors of her right foot, so she was continually tripping up. She then consulted a neurologist, 
who ordered an MRI (magnetic resonance imaging). That showed ventral signal intensification in the pons and the 
medulla oblongata. She was then referred to Nuremberg Sud Medical Centre, where she had an MRI of the dorsal 
spine, which showed no evidence of myelitic foci in the thoracic spinal cord. Oligoclonal bands in the cerebrospinal 
fluid, no intrathecal immunoglobulin synthesis. No treatment was given. There was no complete remission of the 
deficits again since mid 2012. In Nov 2012, the patient banged her head without losing consciousness. In Jan 2013,
renewed deterioration, accompanied for the first time by severe fatigue. She was then referred to (b) (6)  
Hospital in the (b) (6)  Here again, examination of her cerebrospinal fluid showed elevated protein and 
albumin levels as well as oligoclonal bands. An MRI of the neurocranium showed the signal intensification to be 
unchanged and gave no indication of florid inflammatory changes. Again she was given no treatment. In (b) (6)  
her condition again deteriorated and she was referred to the (b) (6)  Hospital in(b) (6)  The 
patient was hospitalized as an inpatient at hospital and reported having been diagnosed with primary progressive 
multiple sclerosis in(b) (6)  The patient was diagnosed with primary progressive multiple sclerosis in (b) (6)  
arterial hypertension, cold nodules in the thyroid gland, arterial hypertension and obesity. The MRI showed a new, 
probably inflammatory lesion in the left lateral ventricle, although the cerebrospinal axis was unremarkable. She 
was thereupon given 5x1000mg methylprednisolone. This was followed by a rapid improvement, but still without 
complete remission. The patient was 50 percent handicapped. In mid of (b) (6)  the patient had difficulty in 
swallowing/dysphagia which led to the hospitalization.
The patient's concomitant medications included Beloc Zok (metoprolol) at a dosage of 47.5 mg once in a half day 
orally, Carmen (lercanidipin) at a dosage of 10 mg once in a day, CoDiovan (valsartan /hydrochlorothiazide) at a 
dosage of 80 mg/12.5 mg once a day orally, all since start of 2013 at the latest for arterial hypertension. 
The patient received Rebif (interferon beta1a) at the dosage of 22 mcg three times a week subcutaneously from 29 
Aug 2013 for multiple sclerosis. Additionally, the patient also received the following (non Merck Serono) suspect 
drug: Fampyra (fampridine) at an unknown dosage since 29 Aug 2013, interrupted from an unknown date to 12 Sep
2013 for an unknown indication.

In (b) (6)  during one hospitalization, the patient received cortisone pulse therapy (5 x1 g) which led to temporary
improvement. Diagnosis at that time was primary progressive multiple sclerosis. Approximately from Jul 2013, the 
patient noticed that her symptoms did not remit completely any more. Approximately from mid of (b) (6) , the 
patient experienced dysphagia, further deterioration of multiple sclerosis characterized by myalgia, pain in limbs 
and bones, stabbing in the shoulder, weakness of legs and hands, weak dorsiflexion of the left foot, gait 
deterioration described as walking distance reduced to 36 m and continuous metrorrhagia. During recent 
hospitalization prior to the event, in (b) (6)  she was diagnosed with a 'prevailingly relapsing course of multiple 
sclerosis'. In the end of Aug 2013, in parallel to start of Rebif, she was given Fampyra (fampridine), which she 
discontinued on an unreported day on her own account, due to headaches, and resumed on 12 Sep 2013 only. 
From 05 Sep 2013, the patient experienced the same events occurred in mid of Aug 2013. On 08 Sep 2013, Rebif 
was discontinued. The events led to the patient's hospitalization from (b) (6)  to (b) (6) . Internistic 
findings at admission included patient in normal general condition and overweight nutritional condition (165 cm, 85 
kg). Blood pressure: 130/70 mmHg. Heart sounds pure and rhythmic. Lungs: vesicular breathing sounds over all 
quadrants. Abdomen: adipose, but soft and no resistance. No pain on pressure or rebound tenderness. Intestinal

movements and slight increase in dysphagia. Otherwise cranial nerve findings intact. Motor function: the strength in
the left upper limb was intact with muscle strength of 5/5. The flexors and extensors of the fingers of the right upper
limb show muscle strength of 4/5, otherwise muscle strength intact. Normal muscle tone in the upper limbs. The 
right lower limb had a muscle strength of 4/5, with the exception of the adductors, which had a muscle strength of 
5/5. Slightly increased muscle tone in the right flexors of the hip with an Ashworth score of one. The flexors and 
extensors of the of the left lower limb had a muscle strength of 4/5, adductors 5/5, flexors of the knee 4/5, 
extensors of the knee 3/5, dorsiflexors of the ankle 4/5, plantar flexors of the ankle 3/5. Normal muscle tone in the

extension test not possible. Reflex status: muscle reflexes brisk and symmetrical, but somewhat more brisk in the 
lower limbs. Neutral plantar response on both sides. Achilles tendon reflex not elicitable in the examination setting. 
Coordination: hopping on 1 foot not possible. Walking on the heels not possible. Otherwise normal coordination. 
Sensory function: mild pins and needles in the right arm, right leg, left thigh, the soles of both feet and the palm of 
her right hand. Sharp/blunt discrimination intact, proprioception intact, hot/cold discrimination intact, writing on the 
skin recognized. Slightly reduced sensation of touch on the right. Sense of vibration 8/8 over both wrists, 8/8 on the 
right lower limb, 7/8 on the left lower limb. Autonomic nervous system: imperative urinary urgency, normal rectal 
function. Psychological findings and neuro physiological status: the patient was alert, fully conscious and oriented in
all respects. No indication of thought disturbances of content or form, no indication of psychotic perception or ego 
disorders. Mood shifted slightly to the depressive poll, but swings possible. No indication of suicidal ideation at the 
time of the examination. Expanded Disability Status Scale according to Kurtzke at admission: 6.0 (36m in 2 min 
without support). Technical examinations included the following pathological parameters at admission: uric acid

spine (b) (6)  a low-contrast lesion of the medulla oblongata without any evidence of contrast medium 
accumulation, would be compatible with MS (multiple sclerosis). However, a differential diagnosis of neoplasm 
could not completely be ruled out, at least in view of the morphology. Further checkups were recommended. 
Otherwise only evidence of a small lesion in the left parietal medullary layer, also without evidence of contrast 
medium accumulation, differential diagnosis associated with MS. Empty sella most likely in the sense of a normal 
variant associated with an absent diaphragm of the sella turcica. MEP (motor evoked potentials) upper limbs on (b)(6)  
(b) (6)  Overall poorly differentiated potentials. Delayed central nervous conduction to the right upper limb, within
normal range for the left upper limb. No significantly reduced amplitude in the comparison between the two sides. 
Findings compatible with a lesion in the central motor tracts of the right arm. Additional peripheral delay. MEP lower
limbs on (b) (6)  Central nervous conduction to both lower limbs not reproducible with any certainty. 
Potentials after cortical stimulation not measurable. Normal peripheral findings. Laboratory findings on 24 Sep 2013

evidence of inflammatory lesions in the dorsal or lumbar spine. No evidence of a space-occupying lesion. Although 
considerably elevated CRP levels were noted previously, there were no indications of infection. Urinalysis showed 
no bacterial propagation. Her subjective condition improved on the high-dose cortisone treatment. The walking 
distance without support increased to 126m in 4 minutes. We tapered off the high cortisone dose orally. There were
no signs of HIT. In view of the positive JC virus antibody test, we decided against Tysabri as maintenance 
medication. We informed the patient in depth about Gilenya (fingolimod) and carried out the necessary 
examinations. She was given the first dose of Gilenya (fingolimod) on 8-hour monitoring on (b) (6)  No 
complications were observed and she tolerated the medication well. The patient was referred to our speech 
therapists for her swallowing problems. She was also recommended to start physiotherapy. The patient's discharge
treatments included metoprolol succinate at a dose of 23.75 mg, Diovan (valsartan) at a dose of 80 mg, HCT 
(hydrochlorothiazide) at a dose of 12.5 mg, Carmen (lercanidipin) at a dose of 10 mg, Gilenya at a dose of 0.5 mg,

a dose of 20 mg, MonoEmbolex (certoparin sodium) at a dose of 0.5 ml subcutaneously, all for an unknown 
indication. The patient was differentially diagnosed with secondary progressive multiple sclerosis in(b) (6) . The 
patient was diagnosed with spastic tetraplegia and skin paraesthesia, the level of the damage to the spinal marrow 
was determined at C6 to C8 in addition to multiple sclerosis, essential hypertension. The patient was treated with
