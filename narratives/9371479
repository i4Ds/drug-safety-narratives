0 a , (Loxonin) was administered. On 27/Apr/2013 he developed hypoxemia and was started on oxygen 
inhalation therapy. On 30/Apr/2013 respiratory failure occurred and a mild increase in KL-6 was observed.

later PCT test was positive and infectious pneumonia was suspected. Garenoxacin mesilate hydrate Geninax) 
was . No apparent aggravation of shadows was observed by chest radiography. On a chest
