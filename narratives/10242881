On 19 Dec 2013
A neurologist spontaneously reported that a 63 year old female patient on TYSABBRI (IV, 300 mg, QM) for multiple 
sclerosis for several years experienced PML suspicion 6 months after TYSABRI withdrawal due to fear of PML.
Patient PML risk factors were positive anti JCV antibodies and treatment duration greater than 2 years. No prior use
of immunosuppressive agent was reported. A few months after TYSABRI was stopped, the patient was hospitalized
for an aspiration pneumonia caused by an incompetent swallowing mechanism related to MS. The patient was 
admitted in a intensive care unit and required ventilation support. After extubation, the neurologist noticed aphasia 
and a right hemiparesis. Brain MRI was performed and revealed a left frontal and temporal cortical and subcortical 
lesion, suggestive of PML. A lumbar puncture was done on (b) (6)  and JCV PCR in CSF results were 
negative ((b) (6)  lab). At the time fo reporting, the neurologist remained suspiscious of PML. The patient switch to

another MS treatment (NOS) after TYSABRI withdrawal. 
French Imputability: C2S1I1
Update 16 Apr 2014:  The neurologist provided the following additional information.  TYSABRl was discontinued on 
an unknown date and the patient was switched to Gilenya (fingolimod).  (b) (6)  months after the discontinuation of 
TYSABRl (discrepant from initial report) the patient was placed under suspicion for PML.  The MRI lesion (date of 
MRI unknown) that prompted suspicion for PML was present prior to treatment with Gilenya, but had worsened.  A 
second CSF sample (date of collection unknown) has not yet been sent to(b) (6)  lab for JCV DNA testing. The 
neurologist stated that the patient has not been ruled out for PML. A final diagnois has not been determined 
between PML and the differential diagnosis of relapse (presumed MS) with pseudotumoral lesion.  Aphasia was still
present.  Actual (presumed to mean "current") disease modification treatment (DMT) was not reported. 
French Imputability:  C2S1I1
Update 16 May 2014: Additional information was received via a Biogen Idec employee from the neurologist. The 
patient received a total of 34 TYSABRI infusions from 12 Mar 2009 to 18 Oct 2011. TYSABRI was discontinued due
to a lack of efficacy (onset unknown). The patient has previously used azathioprine from 27 Sep 2006 to 01 Feb 
2007 and received fingolimod from 11 Jul 2013 to 18 Oct 2013. The patient's MS symptoms were described as 
cognitive, cerebellar with ataxia, and motor with more specifically pyramidal signs and paraparesis.  Anti-JCV 
antibody result returned positive on 23 Aug 2011. PML was suspected due to signs of right hemiparesis and 
aphasia, which both appeared on 04 Nov 2013. On 15 Nov 2013, a brain MRI was performed. It showed that the 
high lesional load remained stable compared to most recent brain MRI. It also revealed that the size of the left 
frontal cortical subcortical Gd-enhanced lesion increased leading to suspect PML. This lesion was already noticed 
on previous brain MRI from 28 May 2013 in the left temporal area after Gd-enhancement; however, no PML 
suspicion was reported at that time.  CSF analysis from samples done on 18 Nov 2013 showed protein in CSF at 
0.39g/L with 7 red cells and 4 white cells. The following Karnofsky scores were reported: 70 prior starting TYSABRI,
70 on TYSABRI prior to PML and 30 at the time of PML. At the time of reporting, PML was still under investigation 
and the patient lived at home with support. French Imputability: C1S1I1
Update 03 Jun 2014: Additional information was received from the neurologist. Samples from LP [lumbar puncture] 
on 18 Nov 2013 were sent to (b) (6)  for JCV PCR testing (results not reported). A MRI (unknown date) showed huge 
lesion in left temporal lobe and basal ganglia. French Imputability C1S1I1
Update 20 Jun 2014: Additional information received from the neurologist. TYSABRI was discontinued in November
2011. The patient was hospitalized from (b) (6)  to (b) (6)  Result received by the (b) (6)  (presume for 
previously reported JCV PCR testing) is negative. No treatment was prescribed for the PML suspicion. French

Update 24 Jun 2014: Upon internal review,  this case is now downgraded to low suspect for PML based on the 
current available reported information.
