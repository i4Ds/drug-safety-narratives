AER 1634984 is a spontaneous case, received on 15/Sep/2015 from a physician via Agency for Safety of Health 
Products (AFSSAPS) health authority, France (reference number: BS20150487) and concerns a 71 year old female
patient who developed progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy while being treated with rituximab (Mabthera), 
cyclophosphamide (Endoxan), vincristine (Vincristine), prednisone (Cortancyl), methylprednisolone 
(Methylprednisolone), mesna (Uromitexan), doxorubicin (Doxorubicine).
Her concomitant medications included mitoxantrone, ifosfamide, etoposide, dexamethasone, cytarabine and 
oxaliplatine. No medical history, past drugs, concurrent conditions were reported.
On an unspecified date in Sep/2011, the patient was diagnosed with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma stage III 
diagnosed after occurrence of a compressive pelvic lymphomatous mass which caused deep venous thrombosis 
and pulmonary embolism. On 08/Oct/2011, she received intravenous cyclophosphamide (750mg, once in a cyclical,
form : not reported), intravenous vincristine (2 mg, once in a cyclical, form : not reported), intravenous 
methylprednisolone (60 mg, once in a cyclical, form : not reported), intravenous mesna ( 550 mg, two times 
followed by 890 mg 3 times, form : not reported), intravenous doxorubicine (dose, form and frequency not reported)
for diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. On 09/Oct/2011, she received oral prednisone (1 DF, 60 mg/day over 4 days 
(Day 2 to Day 5), once in a cyclical) for diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. On 10/Oct/2011, she received intravenous 
rituximab (350 mg/m2, once in a cyclical) for diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. On 09/Mar/2012, therapy with 
rituximab, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, methylprednisolone and doxorubicine was stopped. On 13/Mar/2012, 
therapy with prednisone was discontinued. On 25/Jun/2012, therapy with mesna was stopped. It was reported that

she received 8 courses of R-CHOP (Rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicine, vincristine and prednisone) from 
Oct/2011 to Mar/2012, associated with mesna and methylprednisolone without therapeutic response. On an 
unspecified date in Jun/2012, she received 2 cycles of MIV (mitoxantrone, ifosfamide, etoposide (therapy details 
not reported))  without therapeutic response. On 12/Jul/2012, she received DHOx (dexamethasone, high dose 
cytarabine, oxaliplatine) with again no therapeutic response. On 16/Jul/2012, she developed clonus of left lower 
limb relieved by clonazepam. On an unspecified date in mid Jul/2012 she was diagnosed with worsening of 
cerebellar syndrome of progressive. Later, in /Aug/2012, during the 3rd course of DHOx in third line, she was found
with persistent clonus of left lower limb and spasticity of left upper limb, possibly suggestive of progressive 
multifocal leukoencephalopathy. On an unspecified date, lumbar puncture was performed in order to evidence JC 
virus and anti-neuronal antibodies. In Oct-2012, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy was confirmed after 
lumbar puncture was positive to JC virus.It was reported that at hematological level, she received only palliative 
care. Radiotherapy was maintained in order to avoid occurrence of a new compressive syndrome and thrombo-
embolic complications. On (b) (6)  she passed away. The exact cause of death was not reported. 
Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy was assessed as a possible cause of death. The French rating 
concerning the event was C1 S2 I1 for rituximab and was C1 S1 I1 for cyclophosphamide , vincristine Hospira, 
prednisone , methylprednisolone, mesna and doxorubicine. It was not reported if an autopsy was performed or not. 
The physician assessed the progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy as related to rituximab, 
cyclophosphamide, vincristine, prednisone, methylprednisolone, mesna and doxorubicin. 
No further information was provided.
