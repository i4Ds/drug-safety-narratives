Medically Significant
A neurologist spontaneously reported via Biogen Idec employees that a 47 year old female patient on TYSABRI 
(300 mg, IV, QM) for Multiple Sclerosis from 24 Sep 2007 to 2012 and (300 mg, IV, Q6W) from Aug 2012 to 02 Jul 
2013 experienced suspected PML due to suspicious MRI large lesion on brain, subtle cognitive deficits  and fatigue 
(onset 27 Jan 2014). At the time of this report, the patient received a total 65 doses of TYSABRI from 24 Sep 2007 
to 02 Jul 2013. The patient was diagnosed with MS in Jul 1997. Previous medications included methotrexate, 
Avonex (interferon beta-1a) and IVIG (vaccinia immune globulin).  Avonex (interferon beta-1a) and IVIG (vaccinia 
immune globulin) were restarted after Aug 2013. The neurologist noted subtle cognitive deficits occurred recently 
and fatigue and large lesion on brain occurred after TYSABRI was discontinued. The neurologist suspected that 
large lesion on brain is due to suspected PML. Brain MRI (dated 27 Jan 2014) in comparison to last done (late 
2012) showed right "mostly parietal" lesion about 6x2 cm. The  neurologist noted that it "looks like PML".  The 
patient JCV antibody was tested positive since Jul 2011. JCV antibody index (dated 27 Jul 2013) was 2.54. The 
event of suspected PML due to suspicious MRI is ongoing. The outcome for the events large lesion on brain, subtle
cognitive deficits and fatigue is unknown.  The causality for the event of suspected PML due to suspicious MRI, 
large lesion on brain, fatigue is assessed as related. The causality for the event subtle cognitive deficits is assessed
as unknown.  TYSABRI therapy was discontinued due to the number of TYSABRI doses and JCV antibody index 
value.
Update 30 Jan 2014: Upon follow-up via phone, the patient's neurologist stated that the patient is asymptomatic 
and doesn't have new symptoms. IVIG (started in Sep 2013, QM) (vaccinia immune globulin) is placed on hold and 
Avonex (interferon beta-1a) (started in Sep 2013) is ongoing. The neurologist identified TYSABRI as the suspect 
product for suspected PML based on MRI. Another MRI is scheduled in 4 weeks. Lumbar puncture is scheduled the
following week. There is no plan for the patient to be on PLEX or steroids. No further information is provided.
Update 30 Jan 2014: The following serum anti JCV antibody data were provided from the (b) (6)  database. On 
23 Sep 2011, the result of serum anti JCV antibody testing was positive. The NOD value of anti JCV antibody on 23
Sep 2011 is 0.714. 
Update 10 Feb 2014: The patient reported via a program of Monitored Therapy having a lumbar puncture to rule out
PML as MRI showed "fog layer on right side of brain" (previously reported as suspected PML due to suspicious 
MRI) (onset Feb 2014; discrepant onset date), right leg acting up (onset 2013) and cognitive changes (onset 2013).
Treatment for the events was not reported. Lab testing included positive blood test for JCV in 2013. The result of 
the lumbar pucture is not provided. The outcome for the events are unknown. The events right leg acting up  and 
cognitive  changes are ongoing. The causality for the events was not assessed. TYSABRI therapy was 
discontinued.

Update 10 Feb 2014: Additional information was received from the patient's neurologist office including a MRI 
report dated 06 Dec 2012. The constrast-enhanced MRI of the brain demostrates evidence of demyelinating 
disease. There is a mild-to-moderate plaque burden. None of the plaques enhance on the post-constrast images. 
When compared to the prior MRI of 01 Feb 2012, all of the plaques are stable in size and appearance since this 
prior exam. Additionally relevant laboratory findings includes normal CSF analysis, negative Acid- Fast Bacilli 
smear, negative gram stain, negative CSF culture and negative fungal culture. CSF JCV DNA was negative from 
(b) (6)  (lower limit of detection = 500 copies/mL). No further information was provided.
Update 18 Feb 2014: A neurologist re-reported via TOUCH 6-month discontinuation questionnnaire that the patient 
experience PML under investigation (previous reported as suspected PML due to suspicious MRI). Anti-JCV 
antibodies has been tested positive since 29 Mar 2013. No further information was provided.
Update 27 Feb 2014: Additional information was received from the patient's neurologist's office. During the office 
visit on 28 Jan 2014, the patient's MRI (dated 27 Jan 2014) was reviewed. Compared with the prior study (dated 
Feb 2012), there is extensive progression of white matter change noted particularly involving the right centrum 
semiovale and right parietal white matter confluent in appearance with associated T1 hypointensity with scattered 
punctate foci of enhancement following contrast administration. Differential diagnosis would include PML vs severe 
progression of active demyelinating disease. Close clinical correlation was recommended. The neurologist reported
that the patient experienced subtle cognitive difficulties (previously reported as cognitive changes) as evidence by 
not passing an exam for promotional purposes but the patient attributed to being off her TYSABRI since Jul 2013. 
Additionally the patient experienced fatigue (onset unknown) possibly since stopping TYSABRI. There was no 
family history of MS. The patient's RRMS was diagnosed in 1997 (discrepant date). Medical history included 
spondylolisthesis L4,5 and osteopenia. Significant MS evluation testing results (03 Feb 2014) included high IgG 
(1.33 mg/dL), high IgG Index (0.87), high CNS IgG synthesis rate (7.8 mg/24 hr), more than 5 Olig bands, and high 
IgM total (299 mg/dL). Stratify JCV antibody test(dated 21 Feb 2014) is positive. Interferon neutralizing antibody 
(unknown date) and TYSABRI neutralizing antibody (unknown date) were tested negative. IVIG was started in Sep 
2013 and the last dose the patient had was 08 Jan [2014]. IVIG was placed on hold by the neurologist. The events 
subtle cognitive difficulties and fatigue are ongoing. The causality for the events subtle cognitive difficulties and 
fatigue was not assessed.  No further information was provided.
Update 28 Feb 2014: Per the neurologist, CSF collected on 03 Feb 2014 (first LP) was negative from (b) (6)  but 
the CSF specimen was improperly sent (it was not frozen) and so results are probably invalid. She had another 
lumbar puncture on 27 Feb 2014. Per patient, the repeat brain MRI (date unknown) is apparently is improved 
therefore diagnosis of PML is questionable. 
Update 28 Feb 2014: Upon internal review, this case is considered high suspect for PML pending repeat CSF

testing.
Update 11 Mar 2014: During an outbound call to the patient's neurologist, a registered nurse reported that the 
patient's care was transferred to another neurologist who ordered the second lumbar puncture (unknown date). The
nurse reported per patient, her [CSF] JCV test was negative but the report was not available. 
Update 14 Mar 2014: In response to an outbound call, a registered nurse from the new neurologist's office reported
the CSF sample from the lumbar puncture was sent to(b) (6)  and MRI was done in Feb 2014. The patient was started
on IVIG (vaccinia immune globulin) and Remeron (mirtazapine) on an unknown date. Avonex (interferon beta-1a) 
was discontinued on an unknown date. 
Update 17 Mar 2014: Additional information was received the patient's new neurologist that her CSF [JCV] test was
negative (presumed from (b) (6) ). A brain MRI was scheduled for the patient.
Update 19 Mar 2014: Additional information was received from the patient's new neurologist via office visit notes 
and MRI reports. The patient had a consultation visit on 25 Feb 2014 for differential diagnosis of MS rebound after 
TYSABRI discontinuation or PML. The possible PML was raised from the brain MRI done in Jan 2014 (presumed in
reference to brain MRI on 27 Jan 2014; previously reported). The patient complained having a period of time with 
severe difficulties in cognition and word finding but she was able to carry on with her job. Family history included a 
cousin with MS (discrepant information). The patient was on Avonex (interferon beta-1a) from Aug 2013 to Jan 
2014; IVIG (vaccinia immune globulin) from Oct 2013 to Dec 2013 (discrepant information). Concomitant 
medication included amantadine. Brain MRI, Cervical and Thoracic Spine MRI were done on 25 Feb 2014. Brain 
MRI with and without contrast on 25 Feb 2014 showed similar appearance of greater than 10 cerebral white matter 
lesions compatible multiple sclerosis plaques given patient's history. Slightly increased linear and punctate 
enhancement noted in the region of the right corona radiata. Otherwise decreased edema, restricted diffusion and 
T1 hypointense signal abnormality noted in the right frontoparietal white matter compared to 27 Jan 2014. Cervical 
and Thoracic Spine MRI with and without contrast on 25 Feb 2014 showed 1) At least 3 cervical spinal cord lesions 
noted, compatible with history of multiple sclerosis. No associated abnormal enhancement; 2) No evidence of 
thoracic spinal cord lesions; 3) Mild multilevel degenerative changes, as described. No further information was 
provided.
Update 03 Apr 2014: Additional information was received from the treating neurologist. The patient's [brain] MRI 
(date unknown) is stable and JCV PCR (date unknown, presumed to be JCV DNA test) is negative.
Update 04 Apr 2014: The treating neurologist reported that they don't have a final diagnosis yet but the working 
diagnosis is encephalitis.

Update 16 Jun 2014: ON written followup the neurologist reported the pateint is clinically stable and her CSF JCV 
PCR testing returned negatve; however PML has not been entirely excluded.
Update 15 Sep 2014: Additional information was received via MRIs reports and office visit notes. The brain MRI 
dated 21 Mar 2014 showed redemonstration of changes compatible the provided history of MS with additional ill-
defined confluent T2 abnormality in the right cerebral hemisphere that may represent a superimposed infectious or 
inflammatory process. Patchy enhancement associated with this change in the right cerebral hemisphere appears 
mildly improved with no new areas of abnormal enhancement or new inflammatory change identified. The brain 
MRI dated 11 Apr 2014 showed compared to 21 Mar 2014, similar white matter disease compatible with provided 
history of MS with similar additional ill-defined confluent T2 abnormality in the right cerebral hemisphere which may 
again represent a superimposed infectious or inflammatory process in the correct clinical setting. Patch 
enhancement associated with this change in the right cerebral hemisphere again appears mildly improved with no 
new areas of abnormal enhancement or new inflammatory change. The brain MRI dated 05 Jun 2014 compared to 
11 Apr 2014, similar white matter disease compatible with provided history of MS. Stable ill-defined confluent T2 
abnormality in the right cerebral hemisphere which most compatible with an infectious or inflammatory process 
such as PML given history. The brain MRI dated 07 Jul 2014 showed 1) allowing for differences in techniques, 
overal stable appearance of the scattered preiventricular punctate areas of T2 hyperintensity and more confluent 
posterior periventricular T2 hyperintensity compared to 05 Jun 2014. 2) Now new areas of enhancement to suggest
active disease. According to the office visit on 19 Aug 2014, the patient's cognitive and emotional symptoms started
back in Nov 2013 and picked up in Jan 2014.  The patient was presently getting significantly better. The patient was
continuously on IVIG with the last infusion given in Jun 2014 and the next one expected on 27 Jul 2014. The patient
was recommended being on IVIG due to clinical improvement and stability shown in MRIs but steroids or PLEX will 
be considered if she has any worsening of her symptoms or worsening of MRI. Next MRI was planned for Feb 
2015. The patient did not experience new symptoms or signs except headache with noise sensitivity. Once the 
speed of IVIG infusion was decreased, the headaches diminished. The causality for the event headache with noise 
sensitivity was not provided. The patient was planned to start Copaxone (glatiramer acetate).
