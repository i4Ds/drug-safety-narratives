FOIA Case Report Information 
Concurrent medical conditions included milk allergy. Concurrent medications 
included levosalbutamol (Xopenex), mometasone furoate (Nasonex) and 
desloratadine (Clarinex). 
On April 2013 the patient started Ffuticasone propionate+salmeterol xinafoate 
(inhaled) at 2 spray twice per day. On April 2013, the patient experienced 
throat clearing and headache. Treatment with Fluticasone 
propionate+salmeterol xinafoate was discontinued. At the time of reporting, 
the events were unresolved. 
The patient started Advair HFA about two weeks prior to the report. The 
reporter thought the strength was probably 45121 mcg but could not remember 
for sure. After starting Advair, the patient had been frequently clearing his 
throat and complained of headache. Advair HFA was discontinued after about 
one week as a precaution because of the patient's milk allergy. After 
speaking with the physician and GSK, the reporter expects Advair HFA to be 
restarted shortly since it does not have the milk protein warnings like 
Advair Diskus does.
