This is a report from a Non-Pfizer Sponsored Interventional study, Investigator-Initiated Research (IIR), source for 
Protocoleign. Subject ID11111110An 11-year-old Hispanic (previously reported as White/Hispanic/Latino) 
male subject with hepatocellular carcinoma diagnosed in Dec2009 with primary site of disease at neck (as 
reported), was enrolled in the above mentioned study and commenced protocol therapy on CI Day minus one 
(21Aug2011) with cefpodoxime {the protocol defines the start of protocol therapy as the initiation of cefixime). 
Cefpodoxime was administered to the subject beginning on 21Aug2011 as required by protocol. This was not 
considered an Investigational medicinal product and is administered in attempt to prevent irinotecan-associated 
diarrhea. With the approval of the study chair, cefixime was replaced by cefpodoxime since the subject's insurance 
did not cover cefixime. The subject began the chemotherapy (initiation of treatment with temozolomide, 
temsirolimus and irinotecan) on 23Aug2011 (C1 D1) for solid tumor (NOS). Temsirolimus was given at 35 
mg/m2/dose IV over 30 minutes on Days 1 & 8 (Cycle= 21 Days; max= 12 months). Irinotecan HCI was given at 50 
rng/m2,EV Days 1-5, (Cycle= 21 Days; max= 12 months). The oral temozolomide was given at 100 mglm2, Days 1-
5, (Cycle= 21 Days; max= 12 months). The last dose of temsirolimus was on 16Sep2011 (Cycle 2, Day 1) with total 
administered dose for this course of 38.5mg, and the last doses of irinotecan and temozolomide were on 
20Sep2011 (Cycle 2, Day 5) with total administered doses for this course of 275mg and 550mg respectively. 
Medical history included an episode of elevated transaminases on 10Aug2011 with AST 2011, ALT 987, and Alk 
Phos 799. However, by 19Aug2011, the subject's LFTs were markedly improved without intervention: ALT 104, 
AST 87, and Alk Phos 480. Baseline performance status at initiation of protocol was ECOG/Zubrod scale 0. As per 
the investigator, since the subject was transferred to the investigators institution in Aug2011, the subject has always 
had .a grade 1 transaminase elevation. Additional history included left hepatectomy in Dec2009, hypertension, 
activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) G1, elevated blood lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) G 1, low white blood 
cell count (WBC) G1, anemia and dysesthesia G1. Past product history included single agent (oral sorafenib) from 
Jan2010 to Jan2011; and multiple agent chemotherapy (gemcitabine, oxaliplatin and bevacizumab (AVASTIN)) 
from Feb2011 to Jul2011. The subject developed malignant hypertension, likely from AVASTIN and the decision 
was made to substitute vinorelbine for AVASTIN. The subject developed larungeal dysesthesia with oxaliplatin. The 
last dose of gemcitabine and oxaliplatin was 27Jul2011 as reported and confirmed.

aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, and alkaline phosphatase after the completion of Cycle 1 on 
12Sep2011. The subject was unable to start C2 due to elevated LFTs which included AST 84, ALT 184, Alk Phos 
526 on 12Sep2011 (no units provided). Labs were repeated on 13Sep2011 and included AST 58, ALT 123, 
AlkPhos 462 and although improved, his ALT remained too elevated to proceed with C2. Subject returned on 
16Sep2011, and LFTs were repeated and included AST 53, ALT 75, and Alk Phos 464; all of which were within 
eligibility criteria. He continued with Cycle 2 of investigational treatment and received C2, day 1 therapy on 
16Sep2011. Subject began complaining of abdominal pain on 21Sep2D11, which improved by the afternoon on 
22Sep2011 after taking ranitidine (ZANTAC) x 1 and oxycodone x 1, but then spiked a fever to 101.3. He then 
complained of throat pain and myalgias; these were confirmed to be non-serious events. On the evening of 
411111111. the subject was referred to the emergency department for evaluation. Since his arrival in the ER, 
subject's abdominal pain had been intermittent and "crampy." Labs from amtplrevealed ALT 713, AST 1947,

and Ark Phos 702. Abdominal X-ray in the ER was normal, however the decision was made to admit subject for 
observation and evaluation of elevated transaminases. The cycle 2 day 8 dose scheduled for was not 
administered due to elevated LFTs (alanine aminotransferase increased grade 3, alkaline phosphatase increased 
grade 3, aspartate aminotransferase increased grade 4; with onset of 23Sep2011) and persistent abdominal pains. 
Cycle 3 was also held due to elevated transaminases and abdominal pains. Subject had CT of chest, abdomen, 
and pelvis performed on 040ct2011 for disease evaluation which showed a stable tumor burden, but new 
development of small pleural effusions (abdomen/pelvis) and mild mesenteric edema (ascites grade 1 and 
abdominal pain grade 1). On 080ct2011, the subject developed grade 1 testicular pain and continued to have left . 
testicular swelling/pain on 090ct2011 (grade 2). On 110ct2011, subject presented for scheduled outpatient visit 
and complained of increased abdominal pain and intermittent left testicular swelling. However he denied dysuria, 
hesitancy, and testicular pain. Abdominal and testicular exam were benign at this time, except for some mild 
tenderness over the left spermatic cord. Subject was sent home on oxycontin. Subject then presented to clinic on 
130ct2011 with worsening abdominal pain and reported intermittent swelling of left testicle, which appeared to get 
bigger as abdominal pain worsened. Abdominal X-ray showed constipation, but no obstruction. Sub.ect sent home 
on lactulose, and constipation resolved within 24 hours. Subject then presented to ER on with 
abdominal pain and left testicular swelling (AE testicular disorder grade 2). Abdominal ultrasoun was negative, 
testicular sonogram was consistent with left epididymitis, small left hydrocele, small left varicocele, testicular pain 
grade 2. Pain temporarily improved, and the subject was sent home. On ingift(Cycle 2, Day 32), the subject 
presented to the clinic with complaints of persistent abdominal pain (grade 3) which was no longer relieved with oral 
narcotics, diarrhea related to lactuo[ose {now discontinued), and ongoing intermittent swelling of his left testicle over 
the past week (per parents) though normal today. Subject denied complaints of dysuria or hesitancy. Subject was 
afebrile and had no vomiting. Subject hospitalized for abdominal pain management and investigation of cause of 
worsening abdominal pain. As of (C2 D33) Cycle 3, continued to be postponed due to persistently 
elevated LFTs. On the subjec s total bilirubin was 1.7 mg/dL (reference range: 0.3-1.3 mg/dL) as 
compared to a pre-s u total bilirubin of 0.1 mg/dL on 16Aug2011, His total bilirubin continued to increase steadily 
and was 3.2 o and 5.6 (grade 3) or On MON an MR1 of the river was suggestive of 
Budd-Chiari syn rome with poor visualization of hepatic veins and Arrowing of the intrahepatic inferior versa cava 
(IVC). 
On the subject's total bilirubin rose to 8.3 mg/dL, and alanine aminotransferase grade 3 was 123 
(ran IL), and alkaline phosphatase remained as grade 3. Alanine aminotransferase increased grade 3 was 
recovered to baseline (grade 1) or ALT toxicity resolved on 270ct2011 since it had been entered as 
pre-existing condition Gl. There a reiiMinal serious criteria for these events. 
Elevated LFTs {AST and Alk Phos} which met non hematolo ical DLT criteria, did not resolve to baseline within 21 
days of the planned start of the next treatment cycle. On the sub.ect underwent hepatic vein and IVC 
angioplasty with hepatic vein stent placement for grade 3 ascites. On his total bilirubin increased to 
13.7 mg/dL (grade 4) while on investigational medications. On , a liver biopsy revealed clusters of

home on hospice care), the status of the following SAEs remained unresolved: grade 4 asps ate arninotransferase 
increased, grade 3 alkaline phosphatase increased, grade 3 ascites, 'grade 3 abdominal pain, grade 4 blood 
bilirubin increased, grade 2 testicular disorder, and grade 2 testicular pain. The subject was removed from the 
protocol on 270ct2011 due to the AEs: Due to the unclear etiology, attribution for all AEs remain possibly related to 
drug. There was no treatment provided for the following SAEs, as the family decided to be discharged to hospice 
care: progressive disease grade 5, blood bilirubin Increased grade 4, alanine aminotransferase increase rade 3, 
alkaline phosphatase increase grade 3, and aspartate aminotransferase increase grade 4. On the 
subject passed away due to complications related to his underlying disease (hepatocellular carcinoma). The AE
