A medical doctor reported that an adult male patient on TYSABRI (300 mg, IV, QM) for Multiple Sclerosis from 10 
Oct 2007 to 26 Jun 2015 was hospitalized from (b) (6)  to an unknown date for suspicion of PML (onset 
unknown). MS was diagnosed on 01 Feb 2006. Previous MS therapy included Avonex (interferon beta-1a) from 01 
Sep 2006 to 23 Aug 2007. The patient tested positive for JCV antibodies since 2011 while he was enrolled in the 
(b) (6)  study.  At the time of this report, the TOUCH database indicated the patient received a total of 100 
infusions of TYSABRI from 10 Oct 2007 to 26 Jun 2015. On 30 Mar 2015, an MRI was performed and showed 
multiple T2 lesions that were "troublesome" and the physician suspected PML in the patient's cerebellum.  A repeat 
MRI performed on 21 Jul 2015 showed diffused plaques in right cerebellar hemisphere, indicative of PML.  PML 
was noted to be confirmed via lumbar puncture (presume CSF JCV DNA). The patient was hospitalized to undergo 
plasmapheresis.  The event of PML is ongoing. The causality for the event of PML was assessed as related.
TYSABRI therapy was discontinued.
