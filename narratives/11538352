(cyclophosphamide) (ENDOXAN 1000 MG, POUDRE POUR SOLUTION INJECTABLE), ifosfamide (coded to 
HOLOXAN 4 G, LYOPHILISAT POUR SOLUTION INJECTABLE for reporting purpose), mitoxantrone 
(MITOXANTRONE TEVA 30 MG/15 ML, SOLUTION  DILUER POUR PERFUSION) and etoposide (coded to 
CELLTOP 100 MG/5 ML, SOLUTION INJECTABLE POUR PERFUSION for reporting purpose) therapies. This 
report was received by the FRANCE Regulatory Authorities (ANSM reference number: BS20150487) via a 
healthcare professional and forwarded to Baxter.

CHOP protocol, with Mabthera (rituximab), Cortancyl (prednisone), Endoxan (cyclophosphamide), vincristine 
Hospira (vincristine) and doxorubicine Ebewe (doxorubicin). From 08Oct2011 to 09Mar2012, the patient received 
cyclical intravenous (IV) treatment, with Endoxan, 750 mg/m2, vincristine, 2 mg, (lot numbers not reported) and

received 8 courses of IV treatment, with methylprednisolone Mylan, 60 mg (lot number not reported) for B-cell 
lymphoma. From 08Oct2011 to 25Jun2012, the patient received cyclical treatment with Uromitexan (mesna), (8 
courses of 550 mg x 2 and 6 courses of 890 mg x 3, route and lot number not reported) for B-cell lymphoma. From 
09Oct2011 to 13Mar2012, the patient received cyclical oral treatment from day 2 to day 5, with Cortancyl, 60 mg, 
(lot number not reported) for B-cell lymphoma. From 10Oct2011 to 09Mar2012, the patient received cyclical IV 
treatment, with Mabthera, 350 mg/m2, (lot number not reported) for B-cell lymphoma. On unreported dates in 
Jun2012, the patient received 2 cycles treatment of MIV protocol, with mitoxantrone, ifosfamide and etoposide 
(doses, routes and lot numbers not reported) for B-cell lymphoma. On 12Jul2012, the patient began cyclical (2 
cycles) treatment of DHOx protocol, with dexamethasone, cytarabine, high dose, and oxaliplatin (doses, routes and 
lot numbers not reported) for B-cell lymphoma. On an unreported date in Aug2012, the patient began third DHOx 
course, third line treatment with dexamethasone, cytarabine and oxaliplatin. The action taken with Uromitexan, 
Endoxan, ifosfamide, mitoxantrone, etoposide, Mabthera, vincristine, Cortancyl, methylprednisolone, doxorubicin, 
dexamethasone, cytarabine and oxaliplatin with respect to progressive multifocal leucoencephalopathy was not 
applicable. The action taken with Uromitexan, Endoxan, Mabthera, vincristine, Cortancyl, methylprednisolone, and 
doxorubicin was drug discontinued, and ifosfamide, mitoxantrone, etoposide, dexamethasone, cytarabine and 
oxaliplatin with respect to without therapeutic response was not reported. Reporter considered Mabthera, Cortancyl,
vincristine, methylprednisolone and doxorubicine as co-suspect drugs.
EVENT DETAILS: Between Oct2011 and Mar2012, the patient was treated with 8 courses of R-CHOP protocol for 
B-cell lymphoma, WITHOUT THERAPEUTIC RESPONSE. In Jun2012, the patient received 2 cycles of MIV 
protocol, without therapeutic response. On 12Jul2012, the patient was treated with an other chemotherapy with 
DHOx protocol which also without therapeutic response. On an unreported date in middle of Jul2012, the patient 
experienced a gradual onset of cerebellar syndrome. On 16Jul2012, the patient experienced an appearance of 
clonus of the left lower limb disappearing under treatment with Rivotril (clonazepam). On an unreported date in 
Aug2012, during the third DHOx course (third line treatment), the patient's clonus of the left lower limb was 
persistent, with left upper limb spasticity and increase of cerebellar syndrome, which could evoke progressive 
multifocal leukoencephalopathy. On an unreported date in Oct2012, patient's lumbar puncture was performed for 
the search of JC virus and neuronal antibodies and a confirmed diagnosis of PROGRESSIVE MULTIFOCAL 
LEUKOENCEPHALOPATHY (manifested with clonus of the left lower limb, left upper limb spasticity and increase 
of cerebellar syndrome) positive to JC virus probably due to rituximab treatment was revealed. On an unreported 
date, with patient's hematological results (unspecified), the situation was considered as totally palliative. On an 
unreported date, radiotherapy was pursued to avoid compressive syndrome and new thromboembolism 
complication. On (b) (6)  the patient died due to progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy.
OUTCOME: PROGRESSIVE MULTIFOCAL LEUCOENCEPHALOPATHY: Fatal (date of death: (b) (6) ),
WITHOUT THERAPEUTIC RESPONSE: Not reported. Cause of death: Progressive multifocal

leukoencephalopathy. Autopsy: It was not reported if an autopsy was performed.
MEDICAL HISTORY: B-CELL LYMPHOMA (Sep2011, diffuse large cell lymphoma, grade III Pelvic compressive 
lymphoma mass, at the origin of DEEP VEIN THROMBOSIS with PULMONARY EMBOLISM.
CONCOMITANT THERAPY: Not reported.
CAUSALITY ASSESSMENT: Primary reporter: PROGRESSIVE MULTIFOCAL LEUCOENCEPHALOPATHY: 
Probably related to Rituximab and not reported for other suspects. WITHOUT THERAPEUTIC RESPONSE: Not 
Reported for all suspect drugs. Health Authority: PROGRESSIVE MULTIFOCAL LEUCOENCEPHALOPATHY: The
French Authorities considered Endoxan, Uromitexan, Mabthera, Vincristine Hospira, Cortancyl, Methylprednisolone 
Mylan and Doxorubicine Ebewe as suspect drugs and the causal relationship was rated, according to the French 
method of causality, as unlikely for all drugs. Not reported for etoposide, ifosfamide, mitoxantrone, dexamethasone,
cytarabine and oxaliplatin. WITHOUT THERAPEUTIC RESPONSE: Not reported for all suspect products.
Baxter captured WITHOUT THERAPEUTIC RESPONSE as an additional non-serious event.
Baxter considered etoposide, ifosfamide, mitoxantrone, dexamethasone, cytarabine and oxaliplatin as co-suspect
