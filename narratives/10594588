AER 1492315, is a spontaneous case received on 17/Nov/2014 from a physician via company representative and 
concerns a male patient (early 50s) who experienced high viral load, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy 
(PML) and died due to bowel perforation sepsis while being treated with rituximab (Rituxan).
No medical history, concurrent illness, concomitant medication and past drugs were reported.
About 2 years ago, (unspecified date) the patient started rituximab (route, dose, frequency not reported) once in 4 
months for Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA). Later, the patient experienced  bowel perforation and sepsis.
He had a lumbar puncture done which showed the viral load was high but the reporter believed progressive 
multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) was underlying all of this. The patient was in the hospital for about a month 
when he died on an unspecified date. The causes of death were bowel perforation and sepsis. It was unknown 
whether an autopsy was performed or not.
At the time of death, it was unknown if the therapy with rituximab was ongoing or not. The outcome of progressive 
multifocal leukoencephalopathy was not reported and unknown for high viral load.
The physician did not assess the causal relationship of the events  high viral load, progressive multifocal 
leukoencephalopathy, bowel perforation and sepsis with rituximab.
The physician assessed the event progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy as medically significant.
No further information was provided.
