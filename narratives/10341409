Medically Significant
A neurologist reported, via a Biogen Idec Medical Science Liason, that a 24 year old male patient on TYSABRI (300
mg, IV, QM) for Multiple Sclerosis from 2013 to Feb 2014 experienced suspect PML (onset 10 Jul 2014). The 
patient received seven TYSABRI infusions and the therapy was stopped in Feb 2014 due to patient choice. The 
patient tested positive for JCV antibodies on an unknown date. On 20 Jun 2014, the patient started Gilenya 
(fingolimod) and continued for three weeks until stopping on 10 Jul 2014. On an unspecified date, the patient had 
an epileptic fit and "frivolous behavior." The last MRI performed on 10 Jul 2014 showed 30 new lesions and 20 of 
them were enhancing (3 or 4 of them were tumor-like). A CSF sample tested negative at the local lab (sensitivity: 
200 copies). The treating neurologist would like to test another CSF sample at (b) (6)  in order to rule out PML 
diagnosis and a new CSF sample will be scheduled for July 15th or 16th (as the CSF sample that was previously 
drawn at the emergency room (ER) was likely stored in wrong conditions, so it would be not usable). The outcome

for the event suspect PML is unknown. The causality for the event of suspect PML is unknown.  It is unknown if 
TYSABRI treatment is ongoing.
Update 18 Jul 2014: Upon follow-up, the treating neurologist reported via a Biogen Idec Medical Science Liason 
that the patient is responding to cortisone therapy so the initial PML suspicion is now more oriented towards a MS 
relapse diagnosis. In this moment the neurologist is not performing the scheduled second lumbar puncture.
