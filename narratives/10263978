A neurologist spontaneously reported that a 49 year old female patient on TYSABRI (300 mg, IV, QM) for relapsing 
remitting Multiple Sclerosis from 2010 to 24 Feb 2014 was hospitalized from (b) (6)  to an unknown date for 
suspicion of PML (onset 13 Jun 2014). No medical history was reported.  The patient had no prior use of 
immunosuppressives agents.Concomitant medication included TECFIDERA initiated on 06 Jun 2014. The patient 
was noted to have responded well to TYSABRI. Previous to the event a monitoring brain MRI (conducted every 3 
months) in Mar 2014, just after the last TYSABRI last infusion, showed no abnormalities. 
It was reported that the the patient presented with a 10 day history of decreased visual acuity affecting the right eye 
(onset unknown; estimated 04 Jun 2014 from date of contact ) and was treated with courses of corticosteroids 
during 4 days, as MS relapse was first suspected (optic neuritis). On (b) (6)  the patient was hospitalized and 
a new brain MRI was performed and revealed a non Gd-enhanced large lesion with blurred contours in the left

parietal occipital area. The lesion, was not present in the previous MRI in Mar 2014, and was considered very 
suggestive of PML. An opthalmologic clinical examination showed that the patient experienced homonymous 
hemianopia and not optic neuritis as first diagnosed. No further clinical signs/symptoms were observed. According 
to the neurologist, this case is high PML suspicion based on MRI and clinical findings. A lumbar puncture was 
performed on 16 Jun 2014, and the CSF samples will be sent to(b) (6)  for JCV DNA testing. No plasma exchanges
planned as TYSABRI has been stopped for more than 3 months. TECFIDERA was withdrawn on 13 Jun 2014. The 
event of suspicion of PML is ongoing. The causality for the event of suspicion of PML is unknown.  TYSABRI 
therapy was discontinued on 24 Feb 2014 upon patient's decision as she had 2 PML risk factors: TYSABRI 
treatment duration greater than 2 years and positive anti-JCV antibody serology (test date not reported). French 
Imputability: C2S2I2
Update 22 Jul 2014: The neurologist spontaneously reported that results from both(b) (6)  and a local lab 
(presumed reference to CSF JCV DNA testing) were negative. An MRI performed on 22 Jul 2014 showed that the 
lesions had regressed. The neurologist ruled out PML and provided a final diagnosis of MS worsening. 
TECFIDERA therapy was re-started at the end of June with a good tolerance. French Imputability: C1S1I1.
Update 31 Jul 2014: Upon internal review, Biogen Idec considers this case to be low suspect for PML pending a 
clinical update.
