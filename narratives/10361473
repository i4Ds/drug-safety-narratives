Medically Significant
A neurologist spontaneously reported that a 46 year old male patient on TYSABRI (300 mg, IV, QM) for Multiple 
Sclerosis from unknown date to 04 Apr 2014 experienced PML (progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy) 
suspicion (onset unknown). The patient had received a total of 129 TYSABRI infusions until 04 Apr 2014, without 
any interruption of TYSABRI for a time period of greater than 3 months. No medical history or concomitant 
medication was reported. The patient had no prior immunosuppressants for MS or another disease. Of note, the 
patient was previously included in SENTINEL and STRATA trial, under 653-107. The study is closed. 
In Jul 2014 the patient presented with cognitive/behavioral symptoms, left hemiparesis, cerebellar syndrome and 
gait ataxia which lead to the evaluation for possible PML. Previous MR's were performed respectively on 28 May

2013, 30 Aug 2013, 31 Dec 2013, 27 Mar 2014 and most recently on 15 Jul 2014. In May 2013, no PML lesion was 
detected on MRI. In Aug 2013, suspicious lesion in pre-rolandic frontal right lobe was noted at posteriori. In Dec 
2013, extension of pre-rolantic frontal right lobe lesion was observed. New suspicious pre-rolantic frontal left lobe 
lesion was detected. In Mar 2014, new paraventricular right suspicious lesions gd-enhanced, slight enlargement of 
pre-rolandic frontal bilateral lesions without Gd-enhancement. In Jul 2014, suspicious lesion in brainstem, bilateral 
insula and extension of previous location with Gd enhancement. According to the neurologist, the lesions seen on 
MRI are PML suggestive. Anti-JCV antibodies status is positive with index value superior at 1.5. Anti-JCV 
antibodies was tested in May 2013 (index 3.08), in Oct 2013 (index 5.9), May 2014 (index 3.481) and June 2014 
(index (3.371) (Laboratory: STRATIFY JCV (b) (6)  in May and Oct 2013 ((b) (6)  diagnosis via STRATA), May and 
Jun 2014 ((b) (6) -DK)). Testing for suspect PML a lumbar puncture was performed on 16 Jul 2014 and the CSF 
JCV DNA results returned negative from both local lab and(b) (6)  The event of PML suspicion is ongoing. The 
causality for the event of PML suspicion was assessed as related.  TYSABRI therapy was discontinued on 04 Apr 
2014. French Imputability: C2S2I2.
Upadate 30 Jul 2014: The neurologist spontaneously reported the following additional information. Since the last 
contact, a new brain MRI was performed at an unknown date and showed lesion worsening of lesions with 
numerous Gd enhancements, lesions described as PML typical. A lumbar puncture was planned within 15 days but 
no biopsy was scheduled. Despite first negative JCV PCR testing in CSF, the neurologist confirmed diagnosis of 
TYSABRI related PML, diagnosis based on brain MRI results and on high index values of anti JCV serology. 
Current corrective treatment included courses of unspecified corticosteroids relayed with oral corticosteroids, plus 
Norset ( (Mirtazapine) (15mg, QD, PO). French Imputability: C2S2I2.
Update 02 Sep 2014: The neurologist spontaneously reported that a second PCR JCV in CSF came back negative 
from local lab. Since the patient is still diagnosed with PML suspicion, CSF samples are planned to be shipped to 
(b) (6)  for confirmation. No further information was provided. French Imputability: C2S2I2.
Update 02 Oct 2014: The neurologist reported that 129 TYSABRI infusions were administered. JCV PCR testing 
(2nd lumbar puncture) was negative. The PML suspicion remained high. In order to establish a diagnosis and a 
biopsy was considered. French Imputability : C2 S2 I2
Update 08 Oct 2014: The neurologist reported that the patient was included in SENTINEL from 2002 to 09 Feb 
2014 (withdrawal date), then in STRATA. The patient received 129 TYSABRI infusions (126 during studies and 3 
after studies withdrawal).  The last 3 index values for JCV serology were between 3 and 5. They could not reach the
patient in order to plan a brain biopsy.  TYSABRI was stopped due to increased risk of PML. One month after 
TYSABRI stop, the patient received Gylenia (fingolimod) during 2 months.  No further information has been 
reported.  French Imputability: C2S2I2

Update 05 Nov 2014: The neurologist reported that brain biopsy had still not been performed. No further 
information has been reported. French Imputability: C2S2I2
UUpdate 07 Jan 2015: Follow-up information was received spontaneously from the neurologist.  Brain biopsy was 
not performed for the 2 following reasons: no biopsy site for safe procedure in order to minimize risk of irreversible 
neurological sequelae was found out and disease progression did not show typical feature of PML. Indeed, at the 
time of reporting, the patient clinical condition improved as well as brain MRI features: T1 hyposignal disappeared 
which seemed not to be in favor of PML. Those arguments associated with negative results of JCV PCR testing in 
CSF led the neurologist to rule out initial PML diagnosis. Alternative diagnosis currently discussed is a possible 
atypical MS activity resumption after natalizumab discontinuation. The patient should be examined shortly with brain
MRI scheduled. In case, disease evolved positively and in accordance with hypothesis of MS activity resumption 
instead of PML, TECFIDERA may be initiated. AS recent brain MRI results showed new inflammatory lesions came
up, French Imputability: C1S1I1
Update 15 Jan 2015: Biogen Ide considers this case high suspect and final call based on consistently negative CSF
but MRI with evidence of PML, patient will not have brain biopsy.
