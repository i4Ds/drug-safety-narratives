AER 1490387 is a non-interventional study literature summary case, received from a physician on 11/Nov/2014 and
concerns a group of patients who developed progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), while enrolled in a 
study and treated with rituximab for chronic lymphocytic leukemia, lymphomas, rheumatoid arthritis (approved) and 
systemic lupus erythematosus, autoimmune hemolytic anemia/idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, and other 
rheumatologic condition (off label use).
A Freedom of Information (FOI) Act request was submitted to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for 
reports of PML cases occurring in rituximab-treated patient.  The reports for this study were obtained from the FDA 
in Sep/2013, and by definition of the FOI request, were at least 6 months old at the time obtained. Of the 483 total 
reports received, 173 duplicate cases were identified based on similar dates, ages, and other clinical information, 
resulting in 310 unique cases. An additional 14 cases were added from our 2009 publication that were not included 
in the original 310 cases, totaling 324 unique cases. The cases in this study by definition included HIV-negative

patients in whom rituximab was administered prior to the onset of PML symptoms, with PML confirmed via brain 
biopsy, autopsy, or having JC virus in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) plus brain MRI findings of PML.
Of the 324 unique cases, there were 231 confirmed cases of rituximab associated PML in HIV-negative patients, 
from 23 countries. The majority of excluded cases lacked the necessary details in the reports to confirm the 
diagnosis of PML. Among the confirmed cases, case mortality rate was 89.1 %. PML diagnosis was made by brain 
MRI AND positive JC virus CSF PCR (67.5%), brain biopsy (34.6%), or autopsy (7.8%).  Indications for rituximab 
use included non-Hodgkin lymphoma (58.8%), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (28.4%), rheumatoid arthritis (3.1%), 
systemic lupus erythematosus (2.6%), autoimmune hemolytic anemia/idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (2.6%), 
and other rheumatologic conditions (3.5%). The non-Hodgkin lymphomas were subdivided into follicular (13.5%), 
diffuse large B-cell (9.2%), unspecified non-Hodgkin (22.7%), mantle cell (7%), Waldenstrom (4.4%), and marginal 
zone (1.7%). Median age was 64.5 years (range 19-90), 53% female and 47% male, with 25 patients (10.8%) 
having undergone prior transplantation (12 autologous stem cell, 8 allogeneic stem cell, and 5 solid organ).  The 
median number of rituximab doses received was 6 (range 1-24), with a median of 15 months (range 0.5-128) from 
first dose of rituximab to PML diagnosis, and median of 4 months (range 9-65) from last rituximab dose to PML. 
The median time from PML diagnosis to death was 2 months (range 0-14). It is noteworthy that of the cases 
diagnosed by brain biopsy or autopsy, 17 had a negative JC virus CSF PCR, and of the cases diagnosed with a 
positive JC virus CSF PCR, 8 had at least one negative test before the diagnosis was made. Less than 10 cases 
per year were diagnosed until 2006 when there were 22, peaking at 40 in 2010.
The authors stated that PML was associated with rituximab. They also commented that PML is an often fatal 
demyelinating disease of the brain due to reactivation of latent JC polyoma virus.
