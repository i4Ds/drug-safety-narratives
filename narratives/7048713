FOIA Case Report Information 
Evestiresibleeit Narrative: 
Pas mat:4y clinical trial case, reported by an investigator via another manufacturer (Protocol 111.11111111111.111 
111.11.1111.1.) regards a 50-year-old female. Medical history included pleural effusion since 14Aug08. 
Caneriniiiiiit medications were not provided. On 019 :64  ;  the patient first received the other manufacturer 
investigational drug, pazopanib 800 mg orally daily, in combination with pemetrexed disodium, 500 mg/m2 
intravenously (IV) cyclic (cycle length not provided) beginning on 08Dec08, for the indication of advanced solid 
neoplasm. It was unknown when pemetrexed and pazopanib were last received prior to the events. On1111.1.1111 
almostellrnonths after initiation of study drugs, the patient was hospitalized for  o onia and neutropenia. She 
also experienced nausea, dry heaves, not feeling well, fatigue, and intermittent vomiting, as well as being in bed 24 
hours a day for the last several days. The day of admission, chest x-ray s -  ted subtle infiltrate at the left base 
compatible with pneumonia. Blood cultures and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus screening came back 
negative. Absolute neutrophil count and white blood cell count were not provided. On-, computed 
tomogram of chest ruled out pulmonary emboli but demonstrated increase disease as well as increase pleural 
effusion and interstitial nodularity that might be infectious or progressive disease. Influenza A and B was not 
detected. Qn chest tube drainage culture was also negative. Corrective treatment included levotioxacin, 
piperacalinsodiurn,  ' "- ycin, vancomycin, rnicafungin, and vasopressors. Treatment with pazopanib and 
pernetressO was interrupted. She was intubated. As she became hemodynamically unstable, the family decided to 
initiate resuscitate. Ong... she expired due to pneumonia and neutropenia. It was unknown whether 
an autopsy was performed. The investigator considered that there was a reasonable possibility that the pneumonia 
grade 5 and neutropenia grade 5 may have been caused by pazopanib and pemetrexed. Protocol procedures were 
not assessed.
