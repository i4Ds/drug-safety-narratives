Medically Significant
A nurse from the neurologist's office reported that a 60 year old female patient, on TYSABRI (300 mg, IV QM) for 
Multiple Sclerosis since 11 May 2007 and enrolled in a Biogen Idec sponsored marketing program of Monitored 
Therapy, is experiencing symptoms (difficulty thinking, words not coming out right, and suspicious MRI finding) 
suspicious for progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) (onset 15 Aug 2012). On 18 Aug 2012, an MRI 
revealed a recent developed lesion involving subcortical U fibers of the left temporal lobe and adjacent left parietal 
lobe with findings suggestive of PML. On 21 Aug 2012, a lumbar puncture was performed; results are pending. 
Additionally, the nurse reported the patient "has always been off" (onset unknown). Treatment and outcome for both
events are unknown. Causality was not assessed. At the time of this report, the (b) (6)  database indicated that the
patient received a total of 64 doses of TYSABRI from 11 May 2007 to 20 Jul 2012. TYSABR therapy was 
discontinued.
Update 24 Aug 2012: Additional information was received from the neurologist's office including medical records 
(MRI reports dated 18 Aug 2012, 26 May2012; office visit notes dated 16 Apr 2012, 13 Oct 2011, 05 Jul 2011). The 
same nurse who initially reported the case reported during an outbound call that the patient is JCV Ab positive (Jun 
2010; enrolled in(b) (6)  has no prior history of immunosuppressants, and was previously on AVONEX. Per 
the 16 Apr 2012 office visit note, medical history includes asthma, hypertension, arthritis, chronic low back pain, 
and herniated disc. Family history is significant for heart disease and cancer. Concomitant medications include 
atenolol 25 mg tab PO QD; Zocor (simvastatin) 20 mg tab PO QD; Miralax pack (polyethylene glycol 3350) PRN; 
calcium-magnesium 500-250 mg tabs PO 2 tabs QD; vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) 1500 IU tab PO QD; B-12 500 
mcg tab (cyanocobalamin) 1 tab PO QD; Omega-3 350 mg cap (omega-3 fatty acids) 1 cap PO BID; aspirin 81 mg 
tab 1 PO QD; Advil (ibuprofen) 200 mg cap 1-2 PO QID PRN; Prevacid 24 Hr (lansoprazole) 15 mg CPDR 1 tab 
PO QD. On 15 Aug 2012, the patient's husband called the office to report that the patient was having difficulty with 
speech and thought and was not her usual self. The office then sent the patient for an MRI (18 Aug 2012) and LP 
(21 Aug 2012) as initially reported. CSF sample was received on 23 Aug 2012; results are still pending. The MRI 
report from 18 Aug 2012 indicated the following impression: extensive areas of white matter signal abnormality 
consistent with the patient's diagnosis of multiple sclerosis; extension of a relatively recent developed lesion 
involving the subcortical U fibers of the left temporal lobe and adjacent left parietal lobe, with findings suggestive of 
PML; the differential diagnosis includes a multiple sclerosis lesion. The previous MRI performed on 26 May 2012 
revealed numerous foci of intra-axial signal change again shown without enhancement; new lesion demonstrated in
left posterior superior temporal lobe. The office visit note dated 16 Apr 2012 indicated that the patient continues to

use a walker most of the time. The neurologist's assessment was that the patient's complaints had remained the 
same for the last several visits and that the patient's MS did not appear worse based on objective physical exam. 
The previous office visit note dated 13 Oct 2011 indicated that the patient reported her walking had worsened since 
Jul [2011] and she was more off balance needing to use the walker most of the time. Additionally, it was noted that 
the patient was referred to a cardiologist due to episodes of bradycardia (onset unknown) with a pulse rate in the 
30's and shortness of breath; and lab work has been done every 3 months due to elevated creatinine. The 
neurologist's assessment was that the patient's exam was unchanged from Jul 2011 although the patient believed 
her functional ability to be different. An MRI of the spine (thoracic, cervical) and brain were performed and were 
stable (per 16 Apr 2012 office visit note). Treatment, outcome, and causality for the event, bradycardia, are 
unknown. Treatment and outcome for the event, elevated creatinine, are unknown; causality was assessed as 
unrelated to TYSABRI. The office visit note dated 05 Jul 2011 indicated that the patient's main concerns were her 
imbalance and right-sided numbness and continuation of fatigue. The patient had injured her left knee two months 
prior (torn cartilage, onset May 2011) which did not require surgery; treatment included Ampyra (dalfampridine) 
which was discontinued after one month since the patient felt it made her walking worse. Event outcome is 
unknown; causality was not assessed. In Jan 2010 (date discrepant from nurse's report), the patient tested positive 
for the JC virus. It was the neurologist's impression at the time of the 05 Jul 2011 office visit that the patient's MS 
has been relatively stable on TYSABRI. At the time of this report, the patient is home awaiting the results of the LP 
performed on 21 Aug 2012.
Update 29 Aug 2012: The same nurse reported via email that the patient is doing fine, has not been hospitalized, 
and had not been treated with steroids (NOS) pending the CSF results. 
Update 30 Aug 2012: The neurologist reported via email that the CSF results are still pending but she felt there is a 
low probability [PML] based on how the patient is feeling and the initial CSF tubes. The patient is doing fine and is 
at home since her symptoms (cognitive issues and speech) are intermittent and not interfering with function. The 
neurologist also indicated that she is leaving the practice and will no longer be following the patient. The patient's 
care will be transferred to another neurologist.
Company comment: Contribution of TYSABRI to the reported events of suspected PML, bradycardia, patient has 
always been off, and torn cartilage left knee cannot be excluded. Contribution of TYSABRI to the reported event of 
elevated creatinine has been assessed as unrelated.
Update 04 Sep 2012: The medical secretary reported on behalf of the neurologist that there was a lab error and not
enough CSF was provided in the original tube marked for JCV testing and the test ordered was JCV for blood. 
However,(b) (6)  confirmed that there was enough CSF from the lumbar puncture performed on 21 Aug 2012. 
The test results will be forwarded to the neurologist on 31 Aug 2012.

Update 10 Sep 2012: The medical secretary reported on behalf of the neurologist that the CSF was positive for 
JCV. A copy of the CSF report indicated that CSF color was colorless, appearance was clear, and CSF RBCs and 
CSF WBCs were both 0 (RBC reference range: 0/cu mm; WBC reference range: 0-5/cu mm). Gram stain culture 
indicated no growth. Results of JCV testing were not included in the report.
Update 11 Sep 2012: The CSF report was received from the neurologist's office indicating that the patient tested 
positive for JCV DNA by PCR. However, the actual number of copies/mL was not indicated on the report. JCV 
testing was performed by ViroMed whose reference range for negative JCV is <350 copies/mL. The patient was 
scheduled to be seen by the neurologist on 11 Sep 2012, however, at the time of this report, the medical secretary 
did not know the treatment plan for the patient.
Update 12 Sep 2012: The neurologist reported via a Biogen Idec Medical Science Liaison (MSL) that the patient is 
stable and at home; her symptoms seem to wax and wane throughout the day. The neurologist plans to consult 
with other physicians in his area regarding the benefits of PLEX at this point. He has no definitive treatment plan at 
this time. 
Update 12 Sep 2012: Biogen Idec considers this case to be a confirmed case of PML based on positive CSF, MRI 
findings, and clinical symptoms.
Update 20 Sep 2012: During an outbound call to the neurologist's office, the medical assistant reported the patient 
was hospitalized on (b) (6)  (presumably for treatment of PML). No other information was provided.
Update 02 Oct 2012: The Clinic Research Coordinator for the (b) (6)  study spontaneously reported that the 
patient was hospitalized on (b) (6)  (previously reported) and was treated [for PML] with plasma exchange on 
the same day. Treatment is continuing. No other new information was reported. 
Update 03 May 2013: Additional information was received from the neurologist via a MS Standardized PML Data 
Collection Tool. The patient is alive, residing at home, and is not currently on any therapy for MS. She is described 
as having right hemiparesis, mild to moderate expressive aphasia and she walks with a Rollator (could probably do 
cane, but more comfortable with Rollator). The patient was diagnosed with IRIS by MRI and clinical findings. IRIS 
symptoms included the following: (cognitive, behavioral) worsening aphasia and seeming confusion (onset Oct 
2012); (motor, focal) right hemiparesis worsening (onset Oct 2012); and (speech) worsening aphasia (onset Oct 
2012). The patient was treated with corticosteroids. IRIS treatment included the following: Remeron 15 mg po HS 
(Oct 2012 to present), IVMP 1000 mg IV x 3 days (start date Oct 2012) and prednisone 80 mg po daily (slow taper 
from Oct 2012 to Mar 2013). On 11 Apr 2013 the neurologist assessed the patient's estimated Karnofsky and 
EDSS scores to be 80 (normal activity with effort; some signs or symptoms of disease) and 6.5, respectively. In Feb

2013 the patient had an MRI of the brain (results not provided). No additional lumbar punctures have been 
performed. The patient has recovered from IRIS but has not recovered from PML. Causality for the events of PML 
and IRIS was assessed as related to TYSABRI.
Update 24 June 2013: The patient's husband reported via a Biogen Idec Monitored Therapy program that the 
patient was diagnosed with PML in late Aug 2012 (onset Aug 2012; event previously reported). In early (b) (6)  
the patient was hospitalized (previously reported) for treatment (plasma exchange) which caused brain damage 
characterized by significant comprehension problems (presumed as sequelae of PML); assessed by the consumer 
as related to TYSABRI. TYSABRI therapy was discontinued as soon as the MRI came back reflecting PML. The 
patient is currently looking into taking AVONEX.
Update 24 Jun 2013: The patient reported via a Biogen Idec Monitored Therapy program that she was hospitalized 
in (b) (6)  due to PML (previously reported) and that she now experiences brain comprehension issues due to 
the PML. Treatment for the brain comprehension issues due to PML was not reported. The event, PML, is ongoing. 
TYSABRI therapy was discontinued.
Update 27 Aug 2013: Additional information was received from a neurologist via a MS Standardized PML Data 
Collection Tool. The patient is alive, residing at home, and is currently on Avonex for MS therapy. The patient has 
mild to moderate expressive aphasia and mild to moderate right hemiparesis. The neurologist suspects she could 
walk with a cane, but prefers to use a Rollator. The neurologist assessed the patient?s estimated Karnofsky and 
EDSS scores on 20 Jun 2013 to be 75 (cares for self; unable to carry on normal activity or to do active work) and 
6.0, respectively. No additional lumbar punctures have been performed. The patient has recovered from IRIS but 
has not recovered from PML. Causality for the events were assessed as related to TYSABRI.
Update 10 Mar 2014: Additional information was received from the neurologist via a MS Standardized PML Data 
Collection Tool. The patient is alive, residing at home, and is currently on Avonex for MS therapy. The neurologist 
reported that the patient?s current clinical status is unchanged from the previous report. She has mild right 
hemiparesis and mild to moderate expressive aphasia. She uses a Rollator as comfortable [sic] but not necessary; 
she can walk without assistance but is limited. The neurologist assessed the patient?s estimated Karnofsky and 
EDSS scores on 04 Mar 2014 to be 80 (normal activity with effort; some signs or symptoms of disease) and 5. The 
most recent brain MRI was performed on an unspecified date in 2013 (results not provided). No additional lumbar 
punctures have been performed. The patient has not recovered from PML (although much improved) and has 
recovered from IRIS. Causality for the events was assessed as related to TYSABRI.
Update 17 Sep 2014: Additional information was received from the neurologist via a MS Standardized PML Data 
Collection Tool. The patient is alive, residing at home, and is currently on Avonex for preventative MS therapy. The

neurologist assessed the patient?s estimated Karnofsky and EDSS scores on 05 Jun 2014 to be 75 (cares for self; 
unable to carry on normal activity or to do active work - normal activity with effort; some signs or symptoms of 
disease) and 6.5. A brain MRI was performed in Apr 2014 (results not provided). As of 05 Jun 2014, the patient had
not recovered from PML; the neurologist noted that mild to moderate aphasia continued. The patient has recovered
from IRIS. Causality for the events was assessed as related to TYSABRI.
