COLITIS, FEBRILE NEUTROPENIA, MUCOSITIS
(USA) Initial information was received on 03/Feb/2016, via a healthcare professional from Pfizer. This information 
was in regard to a 2 year old male, who received Vidaza 44mg intravenous on days 1-5, from 13/Nov/2015 to 
17/Nov/2015 for the treatment of relapsed/refractory acute myelogenous leukaemia.  Relevant medical history and 
concurrent conditions included cardiac failure ((b) (6) ), nausea and ascites. Co suspect products included 
gemtuzumab ozogamicin (Mylotarg) 4.4mg intravenous, on days 1 and 15, with the first course on 12/Oct/2015 and 
26/Oct/2015; cytarabine (ARA-C) 1gm/m2  intravenous, every 12 hours, on days 6-10, from 18/Nov/2015 to 
23/Nov/2015; etoposide (VP-16),  150mg/m2 intravenous on days 6-10 and hydrocortisone 15mg every 12 hours 
(route unspecified) on days 6-14 (due as cytarabine premedication), with the first course on 18/Nov/2015. 
Hydrocortisone was tapered to once daily dosing from 28/Nov/2015 to 30/Nov/2015. Concomitant medication 
included Benadryl for nausea, carvedilol for heart failure, lisinopril for heart failure, cefepime for fever, ciprofloxacin 
as a prophylactic antibiotic, granisetron for nausea, Leucovorin, Megace for appetite stimulant, micafungin for 
fungal prophylactic, vancomycin as a prophylactic antibiotic and potassium for hypokalemia.
This patient received intravenous gemtuzumab ozogamicin in a Pfizer sponsored interventional study, protocol 
(b) (6)
 from 12/Oct/2015 to 09/Nov/2015, at which time the patient 
was removed due to no response to treatment. The patient then began off protocol treatment with Vidaza, 
cytarabine, etoposide and hydrocortisone.
On (b) (6)  day (b)(6)  the patient presented with nausea and increased abdominal girth, with mild to moderate 
ascites. Ultrasonography of the abdomen on (b) (6)  confirmed colitis (colonic wall thickening consistent with 
colitis) and the patient was admitted for treatment and pain control. During his extended hospital admission, the 
patient had multiple recurrences of colitis, in addition to severe mucositis and febrile neutropenia, all reported as 
related to the subsequent treatment regimen that was started off protocol on 13/Nov/2015. The patient had not 
received any systemic cytotoxic therapy since hospital admission. An ultrasound was done on 28/Dec/2015 which 
showed resolution of the colitis.
The action taken with the Vidaza, cytarabine, etoposide and hydrocortisone was unknown. The patient presented 
with resolution of the colitis, febrile neutropenia and mucositis which occurred during admission; however, remained
inpatient at the time of the report in anticipation of a transfer to BMT for transplant.

FOIA Case Report Information
The reporter assessed the relationship of the colitis, febrile neutropenia and mucositis to Vidaza, cytarabine, 
etoposide and hydrocortisone as suspected; and assessed the relationship of the colitis to gemtuzumab 
ozogamicin as not suspected. The reporter did not provide an assessment of the relationship of the febrile 
neutropenia and mucositis to gemtuzumab ozogamicin. The reporter noted there was not a reasonable possibility 
that the event colitis was related to study drug gemtuzumab ozogamicin or the clinical trial procedure, but there was
a reasonable possibility that the colitis was related to the chemotherapy regimen started on 13/Nov/2015. The 
Company assessed the relationship of the colitis, febrile neutropenia and mucositis to Vidaza as possible. No 
contact information was provided. Unable to provide follow up.
