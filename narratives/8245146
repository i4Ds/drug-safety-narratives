This 72-year old Caucasian male 
pat experienced increased shortness of breath and pneumonia and was hospitalized approximately 17 days 
after the initiation of study therapy with pemetrexed for the treatment of non-smell cell lung disease. The patient, 
with non-small cell lung disease, enrolled in the study and was randomized to receive pemetrexed. On 14Sep2009, 
the patient received the initial dose of pemetrexed. On1111111.1. the patient presented to the Emergency Room 
for increasing shortness of breath. Upon presentation, oxygen saturation revealed 77% on room air. A chest x-ray 
revealed left lower lobe pneumonia and increasing post obstructive left upper lobe pneumonia. On =NM 
laboratory results revealed white blood count (WBC) 17.1 K/UL, red blood count (RBC) 3.43 M/UL, hemoglobin 
(HGB) 8.4 G/DL, hematocrit (HCT) 27.7%, platelet count (PLTS) 282 K/UL, neutrophils (NEUT) 94.0%,

the hos ital for increasing shortness of breath and pneumonia. Cycle two treatment with pemetrexed was held. On 
the outcome was reported as still present, being treated. The Investigator considered the grade 3 
increased shortness of breath and grade 3 pneumonia as possibly related to pemetrexed. PLEASE NOTE 06-Jul-

manufacturer control number 10-02-18175) case, concerns a 72 year-old Caucasian male. Medical history 
included: diagnosis of metastatic non-small cell lung cancer to the bone, supraclavicular lymph node, contra-lateral 
lung and liver on 12Jun09, and erythromycin allergy. The patient's past medical history was significant for 
depression, tobacco use of one pack per day for thirty years (quit 1986), and heavy alcohol consumption (quit 
1986). Family history was significant for father and two brother who dies of smoking related lung cancer, and an 
aunt who died of rectal cancer. The patient's past cancer treatment included two cycles of carboplatin and 
paclitaxel in Jul09. the patient also received zoledronic acid for bone metastases (date not provided). Concomitant 
medications included oxycodone for pain, dexamethasone, bupropion, lorazepam, chorazine for anxiety, 
paracetamol for pain, vitamins, folic acid, prochlorperazine, and pantoprazole.  On 14Sep09, the patient received 
his first and last dose of pemetrexed disodium (Alimta), 500mg/m2, intravenously (IV), for the treatment of 
metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Prior to the event, study therapy was last received on 14Sep09. 
Onallapedays since last receiving study therapy, the patient was seen in the emergency room for increased 
shortness of breath with oxygen saturation in room air of 77%. A chest x-ray performed showed new left lower lobe 
pneumonia with associated left, pleural effusion. Increasing post-obstructive pneumonia associated with left upper 
lobe primary tumor mass. Right lung was fully expanded and clear. Other pertinent labs included white blood cells 
17.1, hemoglobin 8.4, and neutrophils (with bands) 94%. Additional lab values in the attached source document. On 
111111111111the patient was admitted due to pneumonia and shortness of breath. The patient underwent a 
computerised tomography (CT) scan of the chest with IV contrast which revealed an enlargement in the previous 
mass located in the left upper lobe which was suspected to be due to primary lung cancer or increase in 
surrounding inflammatory or infectious changes. Extensive adenopathy in the left-sided mediastinum also 
appeared larger than on previous study and now at the left pulmonary artery. The left upper lobe bronchus was 
severely narrowed, and segemental branhces obstructed. There was moderate sized left and small right pleural

effusion. Pulmonary emboli were present. Airspace disease had developed in the right paramediastinal lung, as 
well as the left lower lung, possibly due to radiation therapy changes in view of the distribution in the 
paramediastinal lung though pneumonia was in the differential as well. A magnetic resonance image (MRI) of the 
brain was also performed the same day ... revealing no evidence of metastasis of the brain. Possible 
acute to subacute infarct was noted involving the right deep frontal lobe white matter, appearing since the previous 
examination (date not specified). This was not a cortical infarction. Flow void within both the vertebral arteries, 
basilar artery and cartoid siphons were noted with no major occlusive disease. 04=0 blood gases were 
performed and revealed pH 7.48, PCO2 32, P02 63, bicarbonate 24, oxygen saturation 93%. A complete blood 
count was performed and revealed white blood count 17.2, red blood count 3.38, Hemoglobin 8.7, Hematocrit 28.6, 
platelet count 212, neutrophils 93.2%, lymphocyte 1.9%, and absolute neutrophil count 16.03. Other laboratory 
results included glucose 168, prothrombin time (PTT) 34.3, protime 17.4, international normalised ratio (INR) 1.33, 
phosphorus 2.5, magnesium 2.6, creatinine 0.7, blood urea nitrogen 39, sodium 146, potassium 3.7, chloride 109, 
carbon dioxide 29. During hospitalisation, the patient was received corrective treatment with intravenous 
vancomycin, intravenous tazobactam, and piperacillin, intravenous meropenem, methylprednisone, levalbuterol, 
ipratropium, dalteparin, warfarin, clopidogrel bisulfate, acetylsalicylic acid, intravenous metoprolol, intravenous 
furosemide, intravenous lorazepam, chlorpromazine. In addition, the patient was treated for agitation with morphine 
sulfate and midazolam. 0411110 the patient was transferred to the palliative care services. Pa nt had not 
recovered from the events of pneumonia and increased shortness of breath at the time of death. the 
patient died of the attributed lung cancer. Cause of death was progressive disease (grade five). No autopsy was 
performed. In the opinion of the investigator, the events of increased shortness of breath, and pneumonia were 
possibly related to pemetrexed, possibly related to disease progression and not related to protocol procedures. The 
death due to 0 00 ssive disease-lung cancer was considered to be not related to pemetrexed, assessment for
