Case number# PHHY2015NL034552, is an initial spontaneous report from a nurse received via pharmaceutical 
company Biogen Idec on 20 Mar 2015, with a follow up report from a nurse received via pharmaceutical company 
Biogen Idec on 07 Apr 2015, and a follow up report from a nurse received on 20 Apr 2015.
This report refers to a 53-year-old male patient. Historical conditions included gait disturbance and hyperaesthesia. 
The patient was diagnosed with RRMS (relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis) since 06 Jun 2002. Historical drugs 
included Copaxone (glatiramer acetate) from 2005 to Sep 2008, Tysabri (natalizumab) 300mg for multiple 
sclerosis, from 17 Oct 2008 to 12 Sep 2014, QM (intravenous). No concomitant medication was reported. JCV 
(John Cunningham virus) antibody index was positive on 15 Aug 2013 (3.4) and on 28 Feb 2014 (3.669), during 
Tysabri therapy. MRI (nuclear magnetic resonance imaging) performed on 15 Aug 2014 showed two lesions 
suspecting for progression of the multiple sclerosis.

The patient received Gilenya (fingolimod) capsule for the treatment of RRMS, from Nov 2014, at an unspecified 
dose and route of administration.
An MRI on 24 Dec 2014 showed two known puntiforme lesions increased in volume, and one larger new lesion in 
the frontal region (without classic progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) characteristics). It was 
concluded to be evolving disease. An MRI on 13 Mar 2015 showed right side larger increase on the multiple white 
lesions, anterior frontal and also left fronto basal lesions. With contrast, almost all lesions were hyper intensive, and
it was concluded that although not characteristic for PML, PML could not be ruled out, but could also be worsening 
of MS. The patient experienced gradual deterioration of MS (multiple sclerosis). The MRI was reviewed by the(b) (6)  
(medical center), and they provided an opinion that it was indicative of PML, in IRIS (immune reconstruction 
inflammatory syndrome) phase already. The patient was hospitalized on (b) (6)  for suspected PML. Blood 
and urine analysis were performed on (b) (6)  but no results were provided. A lumbar puncture was 
performed on (b) (6)  and the serum and liquor was sent for testing. JCV was detected in CSF. MRIs were 
also performed on(b) (6) (b) (6)  and (b) (6)  (no results were provided). The patient presented a 
white blood cell count of 5.4 and a lymphocyte count of 0.17 on an unknown date (units and reference values not 
provided). A total blood image was performed on an unknown date (results not provided). The patient was treated 
with mirtazapine at a dose of 30mg twice daily and mefloquine at a dose of 250mg once a week. Treatment with 
Gilenya was discontinued on 14 Apr 2015.
The outcome of the event progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy was reported as condition unchanged and 
the outcome for other events was not reported. Causality assessment of the events was not reported. Seriousness 
assessment of the event PML was upgraded to life-threatening based on the information available in the source 
document.
Follow up report from a nurse received via pharmaceutical company Biogen Idec on 07 Apr 2015: Added lab data, 
medical history (worsened gait and sensitive for pain) and new events (immune reconstitution inflammatory 
syndrome and multiple sclerosis relapse). Updated patient demographics (patient's age), medical history (therapy 
dates of Copaxone and indication, dosage, route of administration, frequency and therapy dates of Tysabri), 
suspect Gilenya details (stop date and action taken), event PML (onset date, outcome and seriousness of the event
PML) and narrative. 
Follow up report from a nurse received on 20 Apr 2015: Medical history (historical drug monoclonal antibodies was 
added), lab data and suspect drug's start date and stop date were updated. Treatment medication was added. 
Event gradual deterioration of MS was added, coded with LLT Progression of multiple sclerosis, and event Multiple 
sclerosis relapse was deleted. Seriousness assessment for PML was upgraded to life-threatening.
