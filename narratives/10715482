Medically Significant
A registered nurse spontaneously reported via a Biogen Idec employee (Medical Science Liaison) that a  62 year 
old male patient on TYSABRI (300 mg, IV, Q2M) for Multiple Sclerosis from unknown date to unknown date 
experienced PML (onset unknown), gait issues (onset unknown) and off label use referred to TYSABRI infusion 
every 8 weeks. The nurse reported that the patient had a MRI before every [TYSABRI] infusion. Four weeks ago 
(presumed in Dec 2014), MRI showed a suspicious spot. Two weeks later, MRI showed no change. On 05 Jan 
2015, MRI was done and PML was "clinically diagnosed". The nurse noted that the patient was showing symptoms 
described as gait issues such as not being able to turn on the TV. Treatment for the events was not reported.  The 
outcome for the events PML, gait issues and off label use is unknown. The causality for the events of PML was 
unknown. The causality for the events gait issues and off label use was not assessed. It is unknown if TYSABRI 
treatment is ongoing.
Update 07 Jan 2015: Upon follow-up, the register nurse stated that PML has not been diagnosed; only suspected at
this time. The patient's first multiple sclerosis symptoms started on 17 Oct 2008 and he did not have prior multiple 
sclerosis therapy. The patient was tested positive for anti JCV antibodies, most recently on 20 Nov 2014 with an 
index of 2.39. The patient had no prior immunosuppressant treatment.  According to TOUCH dosing database, the 
patient had received a total of 61 doses of TYSABRI infusion from 03 Apr 2009 to 08 Oct 2014. TYSABRI infusion 
has been administered every 6 weeks (discrepant information) since 14 Jun 2012. The patient had MRI before 
each TYSABRI infusion. The patient was scheduled for TYSABRI infusion on 05 Dec 2014, so MRI was performed 
that day which showed a new non-enhancing, +DWI, lesion. TYSABRI was held and a follow-up MRI was 
scheduled. A MRI on 19 Dec 2014 showed no changes; TTYSABRI continued to be held.  On 05 Jan 2015, the 
patient s wife noticed cognitive changes in patient such as unable to use TV remote; a MRI performed on 05 Jan 
2015 revealed suspicious lesion was larger by about 40% and a new non-enhancing, negative DWI, lesion was also
present. Intravenous steroids were administered on 02 Jan 2015, 03 Jan 2015, 05 Jan 2015 without much 
improvement. Neupogen (filgrastim) has been ordered and the patient will start it soon. No lumbar puncture was 
scheduled at this time. A follow-up MRI was scheduled for 13 Jan 2015, and lumbar puncture will be considered at 
that time depending on MRI findings. At the time of this report, the patient is stable and at home. The causality for 
PML suspicion was assessed as possibly related. No further information was provided.
Update 08 Jan 2015: A health care professional from a specialty pharmacy spontaneously reported that the 
patient's [TYSABRI] prescriber suspected that the patient had developed PML infection and TYSABRI was 
discontinued. No further information was provided.
Update 29 Jan 2015: The patient's prescribing neurologist spontaneously reported via a Biogen Idec Employee 
(medical science liaison) that the patient experienced "confirmed" PML (onset Jan 2015).  No testing or treatment 
was reported. The event is ongoing.  The causality of the event in relation to TYSABRI was assessed as related.  It

is unknown if TYSABRI treatment is ongoing (previously reported as stopped temporarily).
Update 02 Feb 2015: Upon follow-up, the registered nurse stated that the patient's prescribing neurologist believed 
that the patient had PML. The patient experienced cognitive deficit described as slow to respond, can't write, word 
finding difficulty - executive functioning difficulties. The patient was given Neupogen (filgrastim) for 6 days (from 13 
Jan 2015 to 18 Jan 2015) and WBC increased to 40,000 so Neupogen (filgrastim) was stopped. MRI performed 20 
Jan 2015 showed a slight increase in lesion with persistent ring enhancement, + DWI. No lumbar puncture was 
ever performed as the doctor was sure that this was PML. The patient received no PLEX or other treatment as the 
doctor believed the patient's immune system was now fighting the virus (JCV). The patient is at home (never 
hospitalized) with no solid improvement, but symptoms have declined somewhat. 
The registered nurse also provided MRI reports from 05 Dec 2014, 19 Dec 2014, 13 Jan 2015 and 20 Jan 2015 
and noted that no MRI was performed on 05 Jan 2015 (discrepant from previously reported information). Brain MRI 
05 Dec 2014: (compared to 26 Aug 2014) Findings: With diffusion weighting, new abnormal signal in subcortical 
white matter of left posterior parietal lobe; evident with FLAIR imaging as well. It is largely cortical. No other 
changes, no new abnormal enhancement, no new lesions, no enhancing lesions. Impression: New area of diffusion
positivity in subcortical U-fiber of the left occipital lobe worrisome for early PML. It was noted that the patient's 
infusion would be held, and the patient would be reassessed in 2 weeks; an LP would be considered at that time if 
necessary. Brain MRI 20 Dec 2014: (compared to 05 Dec 2014) Insignificant change - still an area of abnormal 
signal in subcortical white matter in left posterior parietal lobe with diffusion weighting; it has not changed in size. 
No new FLAIR abnormalities, no diffusion weighted abnormalities, no new enhancing lesion, no new lesions. Brain 
MRI 13 Jan 2015: (compared to 02 Jan 2015) Slight change in (PML) lesion in the left posterior  parietal region 
which has expanded slightly (10%) and now enhances in a ring enhancement; still diffusion positive. Previously 
noted right thalamus lesion is less distinct (likely technical in origin), still non-enhancing and still diffusion negative. 
No new lesions of subcortical edema to suggest new PML lesions. Evidence of moderate lesion load involving 
periventricular and subcortical brain, and the substance of the brainstem. Brain MRI 20 Jan 2015:(compared to 13 
Jan 2015) Findings: Lesion in left posterior parietal cortical region has increased slightly in size in a more lateral 
direction; still ring-like enhancement surrounding it and still DWI+. The newer right thalamic lesion that was 
identified 4 weeks ago basically unchanged, DWI-. No new lesions, no new foci on enhancement; no new 
demyelinating plaques. Additionally, an office note from 20 Jan 2015 was provided. The patient was still having 
problems with executive function but they had not significantly worsened.  Medical history included chronic 
depressive personality disorder, unspecified essential hypertension, and an allergy to penicillin. Surgical history 
included tonsillectomy/adenoidectomy. The patient was a former smoker (2 packs/day for 30 years) who quit on 01 
Jan 2002. Concomitant medications included Amrix (cyclobenzaprine), calcium vitamin D, Klonopin (clonazepam), 
Prinivil (lisinopril), Solu-Medrol (methylprednisolone), Provigil (modafinil), Prilosec (omeprazole), and Effexor XR 
(venlafaxine). At the time of this office visit on 20 Jan 2015, the plan was for a repeat MRI in two weeks to evaluate

whether or not the patient would start an AIDS drug (NOS) recommended by a consulting neurologist or just allow 
the patient's immune defenses to fight off the infection. 
Update 02 Feb 2015:  The registered nurse provided a Biogen Idec Employee (medical science liaison) a CD with 
MRI scans from 18 Sep 2012, 13 Jan 2015, 20 Jan 2015, and 03 Feb 2015; no corresponding reports were 
provided.
Update 19 Feb 2015: Upon internal review, Biogen Idec considers this case to be final call for high suspect PML 
based on presence of radiologic evidence however no CSF testing has been or will be performed. This case will be 
closed and no additional follow-up is expected.
Update 17 Mar 2015: Follow-up information received from the patient's wife, via a Biogen Idec sponsored program 
of Monitored Therapy, who reported that the patient had PML. The patient's last infusion was in Oct [2014] and 
around 02 Jan [2015] "things were confusing" and the patient was diagnosed with PML. The patient was given 
Neupogen (filgrastim) and has been receiving MRIs every two weeks since with the next one scheduled for 14 Apr 
2015. JCV had doubled (presume antibody level). The patient was never hospitalized for the event and is currently 
at home.
Update 10 Aug 2015:  The neurologist reported via a MS TOUCH Prescribing Program form (Discontinuation 
Questionnaire) that the patient was alive and under investigation for PML.  Since 07 Oct 2014 (exact date not 
provided), the patient had tested positive for the presence of anti-JCV antibodies.  TYSABRI has been 
discontinued; the patient's last infusion was on 08 Oct 2014 per TOUCH dosing history.
