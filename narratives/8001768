FEVER (IN THE ABSENCE OF NEUTROPENIA, WHERE NEUTROPENIA IS DEFINED AS ANC<1.0 X 10E9/L), 
FATIGUE (ASTHENIA, LETHARGY, MALAISK.PLEURAL-MUSION:AN, D.SODIUM, , SERUM 
tHYPONATREMIA,  WHILE ENROLLED IN 
CONDITION OR RELEVANT MEDICAL HISTORY WAS REPORTED. NO CONCOMITANT . .:DICATION 0 
PAST DRUG WAS REPORTED. ON 01 JUNE 2016, THE .PATIENT COMMENCED TREATMENT WITH

BLOOD CULTURES WERE NEGATIVE. O A CT OF THE CHEST SHOWED A WORSENING OF 
THE LEFT PLEURAL EFFUSION, A NEW RIGHT PLEURAL EFFUSION, AND PATCHY BILATERAL LOWER 
LOBE CONSOLIDATION. A LEFT THORACENTESIS WAS PERFORMED THE SAME DAY WHICH PROVIDED

PLEURAL EFFUSIONS (GRADE 3) AND PNEUMONITIS/PULMONARY INFILTRATES (GRADE 2). THE SAME 
DAY, THE PATIENT ALSO EXPERIENCED NAUSEA (SECOND EPISODE; GRADE 3) SPEECH IMPAIRMENT 
(GRADE 3), VOMITING (SECOND EPISODE; GRADE , FEVER (GRADE 1), LETHARGY (GRADE 3:) AND 
SERUM SODIUM DECREASED (GRADE 3). 01 AN ECHOCARDIOGRAM AND ULTRASOUND . 
AB NAL DUPLEX WERE PERFORMED REVEALING NORMAL RESULTS. AT THE END OF THE SAME 
PAY, THE PATIENT DEVELOPED GRADE 3 HYPERGLYCEMIA, THAT LATER RESOLVED ON THE MORNING 
OF 210111.111 A CXR WAS DONE ON WHICH REVEALED NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGE 
FR ,  I  EXAM OTHER THEN A SLIGHT INCREASE IN THE PROMINENCE OF PULMONARY 
INTERSTITIAL MARKINGS. THE SAME DM', THE PHYSICIAN DECIDED TO REMOVE THE PATIENT FROM 
THE STUDY, BASED ON THE CONTINUING GRADE 4 TOXICITY OF HYPERTENSION. TREATMENT WITH 
BEVACIZUMA,:B CISPLATIN AND PEMETREXED WAS DISCONTINUED. A CXR DONE 0 
REVEALED FINDINGS SUSPICIOUS FOR DEVELOPING INTERSTITIAL TYPE CHF. CXR 
DONE, HOWEVER, REVEALED SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN CHF AND BASILAR C LLAPSE FROM THE 
PREVIOUS EXAM. THE SAME DAY, THE PATIENT EXPERIENCED SOME NUMBNESS AND TINGLING IN 
HANDS, RIGHT GREATER THAN LEFT. THE PATIENT THEN HAD DIFFICULTY GETTING WO

PATHOLOGY. A US CAROTID DOPPLER DONE REVEALED NO SIGNIFICANT ATHEROMATOUS PLAUQUE 
VISUALIZED BUT WITH SLIGHT STENOSIS IN RIGHT ICA, BELIEVED TO BE DUE TO TORTUOSITY AND 
LIKELY A NORMAL AREA. A BRAIN MR1 REVEALED NO EVIDENCE OF ACUTE LARGE VESSEL 
DISTRIBUTION CVA. THE PATIENT UNDERWENT A NEUROLOGY CONSULT WHICH CONCLUDED THAT
