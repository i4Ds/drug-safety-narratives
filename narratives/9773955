The subject was tested positive for anti JCV-antibodies on 31 Mar 2013. On 06 Dec 2013 an MRI was performed, 
which was suspicious for PML (new middle cerebellar abnormalities, peduncle bilaterally). Lumbar puncture was 
performed on 09 Dec 2013 and the samples were sent to (b) (6)  and (b) (6)  on 10 Dec 2013. The results were 
pending at the time of this report.
The outcome, the causality and the action taken with TYSABRI were not reported. Reportedly, the follow up period 
in (b) (6)  for this patient has already ended.
Additional information was expected.
Update 16 Dec 2013: A physician reported spontaneously that the CSF sample tested positive for JCV DNA from 
the local laboratory.  (b) (6)  and (b) (6)  results are still pending.
Update 17 Dec 2013: Additional information received from the investigator who reported that at the time of the 
event on 09 Dec 2013, the subject had received a total of 78 TYSABRI doses, with his last dose on 05 Dec 2013. 
He was hospitalized on (b) (6)  The liquor sample taken on (b) (6)  turned out to be positive for JCV. 
Until the time of this report the subject had received 4 sessions of plasmapheresis. The subject had completed the 
5 year (b) (6)  period with the last data collection on 24 Nov 2012. The outcome of the event was unknown. The 
investigator considered the event to be related as "Tysabri-associated PML".
Additional information was expected.
Update 23 Dec 2013: Upon internal review, Biogen Idec considers this a confirmed case for PML based on positive 
CSF and MRI results.
Update 10 Feb 2014: Additional information received from the investigator reported that at the time of this report, 
the event was still ongoing. The date of the last data collection in (b) (6)  was confirmed to be 24 Nov 2012.
Additional information was expected.
Update 13 May 2014: Additional information was received from the investigator via a MS Standardized PML Data 
Collection Tool. The subject?s estimated Karnofsky and EDSS scores were reported as follows: on 22 Nov 2007 to 
be 70 (cares for self; unable to carry on normal activity or to do active work) and 2.5.; on 15 Oct 2009 to be 90 (able
to carry on normal activity; minor signs or symptoms of disease) and 2.0; and on(b) (6)  to be 90 and 3.0. 
The subject tested positive for serum anti-JCV antibodies on 31 Mar 2011. An MRI was performed prior to PML 
diagnosis on 17 Sep 2013 (results not provided) and at time of PML diagnosis on 06 Dec 2013 (previously

reported).  A lumbar puncture was performed on (b) (6)  (previously reported). Currently,  the subject is alive 
and is residing at home. The subject has partially recovered from PML as of 31 Mar 2014. Causality for the event 
was assessed as related to TYSABRI.
Update 07 Aug 2014: A report was received via literature: Vennegoor A, Rispens T, Van Oosten BW, Wattjes MP, 
Wondergem MJ, Teunissen CE, et al. Application of serum natalizumab levels during plasma exchange in MS 
patients with progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy. A health professional reported that the 42 year old male 
patient was diagnosed with relapsing remitting MS in 2003. The patient received interferon beta 1a and interferon 
beta 1b from 2004 until 2007. Because of clinical activity, this therapy was switched to TYSABRI. Routine MRI 
scans were performed every 3 months because of positive JC virus serology (presumed reference to previously 
reported positive anti-JCV antibodies). In (b) (6)  the MRI scan (presumed reference to previously reported MRI 
scan on 06 Dec 2013) showed a new large lesion in the middle cerebellar peduncle, on the left side, and multifocal 
punctiform lesions on the right side that were suggestive of PML. Quantitative PCR showed JC virus DNA copies in 
the CSF (presumed reference to previously reported CSF JCV DNA results from (b) (6) ) and a diagnosis of 
probable PML was made. The patient received his last TYSABRI infusion on 05 Dec (presume 2013) and PLEX 
was started on (b) (6)  Serum TYSABRI concentrations were measured before and after every PLEX. After 
the seventh PLEX, the serum TYSABRI level was below 1 ug/ml (20 Dec 2013).

Meeting of the Americas Committee for Treatment and Research in Multiple Sclerosis and the Europea Committee 
for Treatment and Research in Multiple Sclerosis (ECTRIMS), Boston MA.  Vennegoor A, Rispens T, Van Oosten B

Application of serum natalizumab levels during plasma exchange in MS patients with progressive multifocal 
leukoencephalopathy.  The authors reported serum natalizumab concentrations at the time of the diagnosis of PML 
and before and after every PLEX treatment in four multiple sclerosis (MS) patients who developed natalizumab-
associated PML.  Results:  The required number of PLEX treatment to reach subtherapeutic serum natalizumab 
concentrations (below 1 ug/mL) depended on the serum natalizumab concentration at the time of PML diagnosis.
The number of PLEX treatments needed varied between 4 and 7 in these patients.  Conclusion:  measuring serum 
natalizumab concentrations before and during PLEX might be helpful to determine the optimum number of PLEX 
treatments in individual natalizumab associated patients.  This can avoid redundant PLEX treatments or prolonged 
exposure to potentially harmful, i.e. bioactive levels.  Patient 4 refers to this case.  A corresponding abstract (P872)

C H, Wattjes M P, and Killestein J.  (Sep 2014).  Longitudinal JCV serology in MS patients preceding natalizumab-
associated progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy.  The authors reported pre-PML longitudinal serum JCV 
indexes in four MS patients who developed natalizumab-associated PML.  Results:  All four patients show rather 
stable high serum JCV indexes before developing PML.  Compared to all patients using natalizumab, patients who 
developed PML had higher anti-JCV antibody mean indexes.  No increase of the JCV index was seen before the 
diagnosis of PML.  Conclusions:  Higher anti-JCV antibody indexes might increase the risk of PML within the JCV 
positive patients on natalizumab.  Whether the height of the anti-JCV antibody index is a specific risk factor that 
may be safely applied in daily practice needs to be confirmed.  Patient D refers to this case.  A corresponding 
abstract (P861) was published in the Multiple Sclerosis Journal 20 (S1) 2014. Retrieved from msj.sagepub.com
Update 18 Feb 2015: A report was received via the literature: Vennegoor A, van Rossum J A, Polman C H, Wattjes 
M P, and Killestein J. Longitudinal JCV serology in multiple sclerosis patients preceding natalizumab-associated 
progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy. Multiple Sclerosis Journal. 06 Feb 2015 pii: 1352458514567728. 
[Epub ahead of print] doi: 10.1177/1352458514567728. A corresponding abstract (P861) was previously published 
in the Multiple Sclerosis Journal 20 (S1) 2014. Retrieved from msj.sagepub.com. The authors reported pre-PML 
longitudinal serum JCV indexes in four MS patients who developed TYSABRI-associated PML in a group of 193 
consecutive patients with relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis.  None of the PML patients used 
immunosuppressive medication prior to TYSABRI. The duration of treatment of the four patients varied between 14 
and 78 (mean 53) infusions. The diagnosis of TYSABRI-associated PML was confirmed in 3 patients by detection 
of JCV DNA by qPCR in CSF.  In the fourth patient, MRI lesions were characteristic for PML, but no JCV DNA was 
detected by qPCR in the CSF. PML diagnosis was further confirmed by clinical and MRI follow-up demonstrating a 
PML-IRIS (onset unknown) 5 weeks after PLEX. Results:  All four patients showed rather stable high serum JCV 
indexes before developing PML.  Compared to all patients using TYSABRI, patients who developed PML had a 
1.82 (95% CI 1.51-2.19, p<0.001) times higher anti-JCV antibody index compared with the patients without PML.
No meaningful increase of the JCV index was seen before the diagnosis of PML.  Conclusions:  Patients who 
developed TYSABRI-associated PML had a consistently high anti-JCV antibody index which was higher than in the 
JCV positive patients not developing PML, confirming that the height of anti-JCV antibody indexes in serum may 
have additional prognostic value for the risk of developing PML.  This case refers to patient D. The outcome of the 
event IRIS is unknown. No additional information was provided.
