A neurologist spontaneously reported that a female patient on TYSABRI (300 mg, IV, QM) for an unknown 
indication from unknown date to unknown date for more than 5 years was hospitalized at the neurological 
department of a hospital from an unknown date to an unknown date for suspicion of PML (onset unknown). The 
patient had presented significant aphasia and was suspected having PML. JCV DNA PCR (unknown whether in 
CSF or in serum; presume CSF; collection date not provided) test performed at the (b) (6)
 on unknown date revealed 1600 copies/ml. Brain MRI (date not provided) showed lesions in the brain 
stem consistent with PML. The event of suspicion of PML is ongoing. The causality for the event of suspicion of 
PML is unknown.  It is unknown if TYSABRI treatment is ongoing.
Update 26 Jun 2015: Follow-up information was received from the hospital treating neurologist via a suspect PML 
data collection form. Medical history included MS since 1987 previously treated with Avonex (interferon beta-1a) 
from 2003 to 2007. The patient was tested positive for anti-JCV-antibodies in 2013 (index value was not known). No
further relevant medical history and no concomitant medication were known in this patient. TYSABRI (300 mg, IV, 
QM) commenced in Jul 2007. The last infusion of TYSABRI was administered on 02 Apr 2015. TYSABRI 
administration was interrupted due to unknown reason once in 2012 (dates not provided). On an unspecified date 
the patient presented severe clinical symptoms (dizziness, dysarthria, ataxia as well as inability to walk and stand) 
which prompted an MRI. Cranial MRI in Dec 2014 did not reveal any PML-specific findings. Cranial MRI in Feb 
2015 showed signs consistent with PML. However, these findings were seen retrospectively. Cranial MRI native 
and with contrast medium was performed on 24 Feb 2015, as indicated by known MS, progressive paraparesis for 
one week, hypesthesia, organic psychosyndrome. Results showed multiple supra- and infratentorial lesions, in the 
infratentorial region atypically multiple small spotty lesions with partly definable BBB disruption as a sign of 
inflammatory process within the CNS with evidence of floridity. On 24 Feb 2015, laboratory test results showed 
WBC was 12.12 T/mcl (normal range 4.0 - 10.0). Cranial MRI native and with contrast medium was performed on 
26 Mar 2015, as indicated by known MS, progressive dizziness since Feb 2015. Results showed unchanged 
appearance of supratentorial lesions. Progressive unclear lesions in the pons, medulla oblongata, pedunculus 
cerebellaris medius bilaterally as well as in the cerebellar region on both sides with progressive BBB disruption in 
the right pedunculus cerebellaris medius, in the right cerebellar region and in vermis cerebelli, which were not 
typical for the known underlying MS. The dynamic of morphological imaging findings are consistent with CLIPPERS
(chronic lymphocytic inflammation with pontine perivascular enhancement responsive to steroids) syndrome.
Liquor puncture was performed on 26 Mar 2015. CSF analysis was without any findings. The CSF JCV DNA PCR 
((b) (6) ) revealed 830 copies/ml. Cranial MRI native and with contrast medium was
performed on 27 Apr 2015, as indicated by known MS, dizziness and speech disorder which were progressive in 
the course of time. Results showed on short-term follow up, atypically shaped infratentorial lesions in the medulla 
oblongata and cerebellar region were slightly increased. Supratentorial lesions remained unchanged. The BBB 
disruption in the right cerebellar region could only be limited utilized due to cortisone therapy performed in the 
meantime. On 27 Apr 2015, laboratory test results showed WBC was 11.24 T/mcl (normal range 4.0  - 10.0). On 28

Apr 2015, liquor analysis revealed albumin 36.7 mg/dl (normal range <35), albumin quotient 8.4 (normal range 
<8/1000), IgM 17 mg/dl (normal range 40 - 230), all other values were within normal ranges. The patient received 5 
cycles of immunoadsorption on 09 May 2015, 11 May 2015, 13 May 2015, 15 May 2015 and 18 May 2015. Further 
treatment included mirtazapine 30 mg QD since unknown date and Lariam (mefloquine) since 13 May 2015.
Update 02 Jul 2015: Upon internal review, Biogen considers this case to be confirmed for PML based on the clinical
presentation, positive CSF, and consistent MRI.
