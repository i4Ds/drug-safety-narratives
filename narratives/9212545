Medically Significant
A neurologist in a university hospital reported that a 36-year-old female patient on TYSABRI infusion (natalizumab 
300 mg, IV, QM) for Multiple Sclerosis (MS) from 2007 to 14 Mar 2013 had been hospitalized there since 19 Mar 
2013 because of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) with cerebellar ataxia  (onset beginning of 
March 2013). On 20 Mar 2013, JC Virus (JCV) PCR in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was performed at the local 
laboratory (university hospital) with more than 800 copies/ml, and on 22 Mar 2013, another JCV PCR in CSF was 
performed at the Virological Institute of the (b) (6)  with more than 120 copies/ml. Treatment 
included mirtazapine (30 mg, PO, QD), mefloquine (250 mg, QW) and immunadsorption for PML since 22 Mar 
2013. The outcome for the event PML with cerebellar ataxia was ongoing. Medical history included MS since 2005. 
Concomitant medication was not reported. The neurologist assessed the event of PML as related to TYSABRI. 
TYSABRI therapy was permanently discontinued.
Update 19 Apr 2013: Follow-up received from the same neurologist provided the following additional information. 
The patient had received about 47 TYSABRI infusions in total from 2007 to 14 Mar 2013 at a neurological practice 
(not at the university hospital). The reporting neurologist has been informed by the neurologist from the practice that
an anti-JCV antibody test had been performed (date not reported) and that the test result had been negative. Prior 
to the event of PML, the patient?s estimated disability status score (EDSS) was 2.0. Beginning of March 2013, 
about two weeks prior to hospitalization (admission date on (b) (6) ), the patient had presented mild cerebellar
symptoms characterized by unstable gait and ataxia. As the patient did not consider these symptoms as relevant, 
she did not mention them to her treating neurologist. The patient did not have any other typical PML symptoms. On 
13 Mar 2013, a routine cranial magnetic resonance imaging (cMRI) native and with Gadovist (gadolinium, 6 ml, IV) 
was performed which was consistent with infratentorial located PML. When compared to results of a MRI from Jun 
2011, the following was noticed: T2 images showed infratentorial on the right side in the cerebellar peduncle and 
white matter of the cerebellar hemisphere partially diffuse, partially distinct signal alteration with contrast 
enhancement. Clearly distinct ribbon-like hyperintensities were also seen in the upper pons (fibrae pontis 
transversae). These findings were considered highly suspicious for PML. Compared to the previous MRI from Jun 
2011, there were no changes supratentorial.  As the results of the MRI (performed on 13 Mar 2013) was not 
available right away, the patient received her TYSABRI infusion on 14 Mar 2013 as scheduled. The patient?s 
cerebellar symptoms got worse until she was hospitalized on (b) (6)  when her EDSS was 5.5. She was 
treated with four cycles of immunoadsorption. Due to a bronchopulmonary infection with fever (assumed by the 
company with onset in (b) (6) ), a planned fifth cycle of immunoadsorption was dismissed. As neurological 
symptoms were stable under the treatment, the patient was discharged and further cared for on an outpatient basis.

However, since 10 Apr 2013, her condition had worsened (EDSS was 6.5), which was assessed as immune 
reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS). When the patient was seen on 11 Apr 2013 in the outpatient facility, a 
hospitalization for cortisone pulse therapy was strongly recommended; however, the patient refused to be 
hospitalized. Therefore it was agreed that the patient received cortisone pulse treatment at the neurological 
practice. Starting on 12 Apr 2013, cortisone pulse therapy (unknown therapy details) was administered for five days
at the neurological practice. On 18 Apr 2013 the patient had reported on the phone that coordination disturbance 
has improved. A follow-up MRI was scheduled for 19 Apr 2013 (result pending). Admission at a rehabilitation center
is planned. Previous MS treatments comprised interferon-beta and immunoglobulins. Causality for the events of 
IRIS and bronchopulmonary infection was not assessed.
Update 06 May 2013: Based on an internal review of existing information in the case, Biogen Idec now considers 
this case to be a confirmed case of PML.
Update 05 Jun 2013: Patient's treating neurologist from the local physician practice clarified that an anti-JCV 
antibody test had never been performed. Instead, the patient had been tested for anti-natalizumab antibodies in 
2008 and that test result was negative.
Update 05 Jun 2013: The initially reporting neurologist from the university hospital reported that, as reported by the 
patient, the estimated Karnofsky score was 90 prior to starting TYSABRI therapy (date not provided) and was 90 on
TYSABRI prior to PML (date not provided). On (b) (6)  at the time of PML diagnosis, the Karnofsky score was
60. On 22 Mar 2013, a blood sample was tested negative for JCV DNA. JCV DNA in urine and a HIV test were not 
performed and the patient has not been tested for serum anti-JCV antibody status. On 26 Apr 2013, a MRI brain 
native and with contrast was performed and compared to the previous MRI from 13 Mar 2013: T2 FLAIR sequence 
showed a fine spotted increase in signal strength central in the mesencephalon, dorsal in the pons and bilateral in 
the cerebellum. Compared to the preliminary MRI, a progression in size of these lesions was noted, especially in 
the pons and in the left medial cerebellar peduncle. The fine spotted hyperintensities in the juxtacortical and 
periventricular medullary white matter were unchanged. The ventricular system was of normal width with no 
indication of CSF circulatory dysfunction. With contrast medium, a low-grade diffuse cloudy contrast enhancement 
of the cerebellar lesions was seen. This contrast enhancement was interpreted as being suspicious for IRIS, 
whereas an exacerbation of PML was considered unlikely. As of 08 May 2013, the PML was considered not 
resolved by the neurologist. Rationale was that the patient was currently still at a rehabilitation facility and hence the
final outcome could not be assessed.
Update 02 Sep 2013: The treating neurologist reported that the patient had taken Betaferon (interferon beta-1b, 
unknown dose, route, frequency) for MS from Jun 2005 to Oct 2005 and Octagam (immunoglobulins, unknown 
dose, route, frequency) for MS from Nov 2005 to Oct 20107. The patient started TYSABRI therapy in the end of

2007 with an administration interval of five weeks (off-label use). Due to weight loss (onset date unknown) the 
interval was prolonged to eight weeks. After an MS relapse in 2008 the interval was reduced to six weeks. The 
patient had been tested negative for neutralizing antibodies against TYSABRI with ELISA on 24 Sep 2008.  The 
neurologist provided the following additional laboratory test results: On 14 Mar 2013, T-Helper cell (CD4) count was
1437 (unit not reported, normal range 410 ? 1590), T-suppressor (CD8) cell count was 560 (unit not reported, 
normal range 190 ? 1140), and CD4/CD8-ratio was 2.57 (0.8 ? 4.2). On 01 Jul 2013 those values were: CD4 603 
(410 ? 1590), CD8 295 (190 ? 1140), and CD4/CD8-ratio 2.04 (0.8 ? 4.2). In general CD4 and CD8 counts as well 
as CD4/CD8 ratio had dropped at the time of PML onset but remained within normal ranges. JCV PCR in CSF was 
tested in the laboratory of the university hospital and revealed  over 800 copies/ml on 22 Mar 2013. PML was 
treated with Celsentri (maraviroc, 300 mg, route and frequency unknown). As reported previously, the patient 
experienced a bronchopulmonary infection during the hospitalization from (b) (6)  to (b) (6)  which had 
been treated with Tavanic (levofloxacin 250 mg, unknown route, BID) from Mar 2013 to 02 Apr 2013 as well as 
Paracetamol (acetaminophen 1000 mg, unknown route, TID) for fever as needed in Mar 2013. Laboratory test 
results during hospitalization showed slightly increased CRP. Chest x-ray and urinalysis were without pathological 
findings.  The discharge summary for this hospitalization also mentioned allergic asthma bronchiale (onset 
unknown).  Treatment information, outcome and causality assessment for the events of allergic asthma bronchiale, 
weight loss and MS relapse were not provided.  From 28 May 2013 to 14 Jun 2013, the patient had been treated on
an in-patient basis at a rehabilitation center. The patient requires physiotherapy, speech therapy and occupational 
therapy. An MRI from 02 Jul 2013 showed the following findings: Compared to a previous scan from 17 Apr 2013 
the radiological status had clearly worsened. The PML-specific signal alterations had increased in size in both 
cerebellar hemispheres and spread subcortically into the cerebellar peduncles and pons. Correspondingly the blood
brain barrier disruption had increased with cloudy contrast enhancement in both cerebellar hemispheres and 
peduncles (more pronounced on the left), and streaky enhancement along the traverse pontine fibers. The 
supratentorial lesions appeared unchanged in number and size. In addition to the pre-existing blood brain barrier 
disruption there were discrete minute contrast enhancing lesions subcortical left frontal. The patient?s estimated 
EDSS score assessed in Aug 2013 was 5.5.
The neurologist assessed causality for the events of PML and IRIS as related to TYSABRI.
Update 03 Sep 2013: The treating neurologist reported that the patient?s condition improved and she lives at home.
 He mentioned that the course was fortunately favorable. The patient was able to walk with only a little assistance 
(light support with one finger to maintain balance). Since the JC virus had affected only the cerebellum, the patient 
showed predominantly cerebellar symptoms. No second lumbar puncture had been performed for testing of liquor 
for JCV DNA after (b) (6)  The patient is currently on Avonex injections (interferon beta-1a, unknown dose, 
route, frequency) for multiple sclerosis.
Update 06 Sep 2013: The treating neurologist provided various line charts for B-cells, T-cells, lymphocytes and

others. A clear decrease of CD4, CD3 and CD19 was seen at the time PML occurred.
Update 15 Apr 2014: This case was reported via the literature: Hoepner R, Ahlbrecht J, Faissner S,  Schneider R et
al. Clinical and paraclinical findings in natalizumab-associated infratentorial progressive multifocal 
leukoencephalopathy patients. J Neurol Neurosurg Psychiatry 2014 Vol 0 No 0. No new significant information 
pertaining to this case was reported.
Update 23 Apr 2014: A report was received via the literature, Warnke C, von Geldern G, Markwerth P, et al. The 
CSF JCV antibody index for diagnosis of natalizumab-associated PML, Potential implications for PML case 
definition. Annals of Neurology. Accepted Article. doi:10.1002/ana.24153. Ahead of print (not yet published). The 
author reported that the patient (identified as case 12) was categorised in the qPCR>100 copies/ml AI (antibody 
index) >1.5 group. At the time of PML diagnosis: CSF JCV DNA testing showed 120 copies/ml and CSF JCV 
antibody Index (AI JCV) of 5.63. It was reported that clinical and MRI findings raised the suspicion of PML 
prompting CSF analysis for JCV-DNA, which did not detect viral DNA at two time points. A definite diagnosis of 
PML was established 3 months later, when the 120 copies/ml of JCV-DNA were detected on repeat CSF testing at 
the (b) (6) . Compatible with clinical suspicion of an earlier start of PML, the 
retrospective analysis of stored CSF-serum pairs displayed an elevated and increasing AI JCV already 3 and 2 
months prior to the first positive detection of JCV-DNA in CSF by qPCR; the AI JCV was 3.60 3 months prior to 
PML diagnosis. The author concluded that determination of the AI JCV could be an added tool in the diagnostic 
workup for PML and should be included in the case definition of natalizumab associated PML. No additional 
information was provided.
Update 20 Nov 2014: Information was received via the literature: Warnke C., Stettner M., Lehmensick V., et al. 
Natalizumab exerts a suppressive effect on surrogates of B cell function in blood and CSF. Multiple Sclerosis 
Journal.  Published online 12 November 2014.  The authors aimed to assess the effect of natalizumab on cellular 
composition and functional B cell parameters including 37 patients with natalizumab-associated PML.  IgG levels in 
blood and CSF were available from the 37 patients, of which 20 were first sampled at time of diagnosis as defined 
by a first positive PCR for JCV DNA in CSF.  Patients with natalizumab-associated PML were 28-63 years old 
(average 45), 68% were female, and the treatment duration was 19-75 months (average 44).  The authors 
concluded that natalizumab impacts B and T cell distribution and exerts an inhibitory effect on surrogates of B cell 
function in periphery and in cerebrospinal fluid, potentially contributing to the increased risk of developing PML.
This case refers to one of the 37 patients with natalizumab-associated PML.  No additional information was 
provided regarding this patient.
Update 09 Mar 2015:  A report was received via the review of a scientific presentation provided by the hospital 
neurologist. The 36 year old patient on TYSABRI since Jul 2007 experienced PML. Symptoms (presumed by the

company - underlying MS symptoms) were described as: slight tingling sensation in the right hand, exaggerated 
reflexes. Cranial MRIs performed from Jan 2008 to Sep 2008 revealed cortical involvement specified as 
progression of MRI changes in the right motor cortex. No further information was provided.
Update 05 May 2015: Additional information for the Standardized MS PML Data Collection Tool was received from 
the neurologist via a telephone call with a Biogen employee.  The last MRI performed on 24 Sep 2014 showed no 
barrier disturbance, unchanged supratentorial lesions, no progression of the PML lesions. In the cerebellum, 
several damaged areas were seen. Otherwise, there were no pathological findings. The patient is currently on 
preventative therapy for Multiple Sclerosis which includes TECFIDERA (dimethyl fumarate) (240 mg, 1X, patient is 
slender) since Dec 2014. The patient had visited the neurologist's practice approximately 14 days ago. She was in 
a very good condition, had only a mild cerebellar syndrome with wobbly gait.  Occupational rehabilitation was 
considered. She was able to cope with her daily life and did housework. At the time of this report, the patient is alive
and residing at home.  Estimated Karnofsky score (unknown date) was 80 (normal activity with effort; some signs 
or symptoms of disease) and EDSS score in Apr 2015 was 4 to 5. The events of PML and IRIS have resolved, 
dates were not provided. Causality for the events of PML and IRIS was assessed as related to TYSABRI.
