Ian male. I History: Tonsil cancer, Radiotherapy, Metastasis, Empyema, Pneumonia, 
Gastrointestinal tube a o , Tooth ext n, and Denture wearer. Concomitant Medications: diphenhydramine 
panscetamol, ps a edrine hydrochloride, palonosetron hloride, dexamethasone, 
pethidine hydrochloride, and met  o isolone sodium succinate. The patient received supplementation with 
cyanembalamin and folic acid. On 23-Aug-2011, the patient received the first doses of intravenous pemetrexed 
(501 mgint2, day 1 every 21 days), carboplatin (5 AUC, day 1 every 21 days), and cetuximab (loading dose 400 
moten2 on day 1 every 21 days. subsequently 250 mglm2 weekly) for the treatment of head and neck cancer. This 
was also the last dose of study drugs prior to the event. On the patient phoned to 
repoithe had had a night and felt very sick. He state.d olTel urs e had deve - 0 chest pain 
similar to what he experienced a few months ago when he was hospitalized for empyema. The patient reported he 
started to cough, expo o0. n mucus, and passed out twice during the night. Since no one was 
available to transport him to the hospital, 911 was called. On days since receiving the first and only 
dose of study , the patient was hospitalized due to grade pneumonia. In the emergency room (ER), the 
patients temperature was 100.3 and he was volume depleted and hypotensive, with blood pressure 66/44. The 
hypotension (not considered an SAE) was due to volume depletion, as the patient was not drinking adequate fluids. 
Lab tests white ri d  cell (WBC) count 2.7 and lactic acid 4.8 (units and reference ranges not provided). 
0 0 0 cultures were negative. The patient received four liters of IV fluid, but remained hypotensive and was 
subsequently started on 0 a drip. On the same day, chest x-ray showed right middle lobe pneumonia. A 
computerized tom o o (CT) scan of the chest s o extensive infiltrate, predominantly right lung. The patient 
was treated with vancomycin and piperacillin sodium/tazobactm sodium. He was transferred to the intensive care 
unit where he was monitored and given additional IV fluids and antibiotics. On 30-Aug-2011, cetuximab was held.

FOIA Case Report Information 
On 1111111.1.1 a bronchoscopy was performed and no malignanc was seen. On sputum culture 
showed greater than 25 WBC and less than10 epithelial cells. On repeat chest CT showed right 
middle lobe consolidation. On an unspecified date, a thoracentesis was attempted, but pro. d no fluid, and on 
ram was negative for pleural fluid. The patient was later transferred totheppressive  care unit 
he became hemodynamically stable and gradually regained his strength. On WBC 
count W138 2.0. On the same day, the patient was considered to be recovered from pneumonia and was discharged. 
On 13-Sep-2011, a decision was made to hold pemetrexed and carboplatin at cycle 2 due to the event. However, 
on the same day, cetuximab was resumed. A week later, on 20-Sep-2011, the patient received cycle 2 doses of 
pemetrexed and ca a  0 !Min. In the opinion of the investigator, grade 3 pneumonia was related to pemetrexed and 
ca Goo ,  tin, but not related to cetuximab and protocol procedures. The investigator explained that low. WBC count 
due to the effects of chemotherapy made the patient more susceptible to infection. In addition, the patient had a 
history of o  'a in March 2011. Update 03-Oct-2011: Additional information received on 29-Sep-2011 and 
30-Sep-2011 from the study investigator: Amended event term from pneumonia right, middle lobe to pneumonia 
with pleurisy (final sis). Amended study drug action taken from no change to study drugs held. Amended 
event outcome from not recovered to recovered (08-Sep-2011). Provided study drug restart dates, hospital 
thscharge date, causality for pemetrexed and cetuximab, additional laboratory and diagnostic test results, additional 
event details, and event treatment. Updated fields and narrative accordingly. Update 11-Jan-2012: Additional 
information received on 10-Jan-2012 from the study investigator: Amended relatedness for pemetrexed (unrelated 
to related), cetuximab (related to unrelated), and carboplatin (unrelated to related). Provided explanation for 
causality assessment, dates pemetrexed and carboplatin were held, medical history of pneumonia, and additional 
event details. Updated fields and narrative accordingly. Update 12-Mar-2012: Additional information received on 
09-Mar-2012 from the study investigator Amended event term from pneumonia with pleurisy to pneumonia.
