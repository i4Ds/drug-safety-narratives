Medically Significant
The below information is a case summary from 15 Jul 2014 to 14 Aug 2014.
This case concerns a 50 year old female patient on TYSABRI for MS x 45 infusions from 12 Aug 2010 to 29 May 
2014. Concomitant illnesses include Type I Diabetes Mellitus (childhood) and Basedow's disease. Her MS was 
diagnosed in 2005. She tested anti-JCV antibody positive in 2011 and has no IS history. Her previous MS therapy 
included Copaxone from 2007 to July 2010. The PML suspicion was initially prompted by a routine MRI from 26 
May 2014 which showed the following: Compared to the previous exam performed on 21 Feb 2014, some 
punctiform haloes of signal accentuation were found in the left fronto-parietal white matter, mainly located in 
subcortical area, some of which showed enhancement in the sequences acquired after contrast medium 
administration. Such finding, also considering the treatment administered, could be ascribable to an initial

demyelination of infective nature. Unchanged all other findings.  Clinically, the patient was asymptomatic and was 
hospitalized at (b) (6)  Hospital for PML evaluation. CSF collected on 05 Jun 2014 returned negative from 2 local labs 
(LLD: 100 copies/mL). The patient was discharged home. On 20 June 2014, the patient became symptomatic with 
cognitive disorders (notes of expressive dysphasia, dystextia, videomotor slowing, executive disorders) which were 
confirmed at a clinical evaluation on 01-Jul-2014. Brain and brainstem MRI, MR spectroscopy were performed on 
11 Jul 2014 (report dated 12 Jul 2014) and revealed the following: Compared to previous exam dated 26 May 2014,
a worsening of the picture was found, with a clear increase of the punctiform signal accentuations in the T2-
dependent images, which affected more extensively the subcortical fronto-parieto-temporo-insular white matter at 
left and involved the close cortical layer. The lesions were more numerous at the level of the frontal operculum, 
rolandic foot, superior side of the insula, supramarginal gyrus and of the supra-mesial portion of the left parietal 
lobe where they had a confluent aspect. They had a pale signal hypeintensity in the diffusion weighted images and 
were associated to a pathological accumulation of lipid and lactate. Some isolated punctiform foci, of similar 
meaning, were found contralaterally, in the semioval centre and in the subcortical front-parietal white matter at right.
After IV contrast medium administration, multiple punctiform enhancements were found, clearly increased in 
comparison with the previous examination. Perifocal edema and mass effect was not found associated to this 
picture. The picture evolution was compatible to the hypothesis previously formulated of demyelination of infective 
nature. Subsequently, the patient was hospitalized on (b) (6)  at (b) (6)  Hospital. The patient had a second
LP on (b) (6)  which returned positive at 31 copies/mL from the (b) (6)  (results received on (b) (6) ).
Another repeat MRI was performed on (b) (6)  further confirmed the PML radiological picture. During the 
second hospitalization, the patient underwent 2 cycles of plasmapheresis and was started on mirtazapine, 
mefloquine, and Maraviroc since(b) (6) . Biogen Idec considered this case confirmed for PML on (b) (6)
based on the clinical symptoms, positive CSF, and MRI findings.
Update 15 Sep 2014: A follow-up report received from the Regulatory Authority of Italy - National 
Pharmacovigilance Network (NPN) (registry # 259968) stated that the Regional Centre/Regulatory Authority's 
assessment of the relationship between the drug (presume TYSABRI) and the adverse reaction (presume PML), 
evaluated through Naranjo algorithm, is probable. No further information was provided.
Update 20 Oct 2014: The neurologist spontaneously provided findings for MRIs performed on 26 May 2014 (report 
received 30 May 2014; previously reported), 11 Jul 2014 (previously reported), 03 Sep 2014, 17 Sep 2014, and 06 
Oct 2014. The brain MRI from 03 Sep 2014 revealed a worsening picture along with an extension of the PML lesion
which has a multifocal appearance; currently an extended signal alteration was observable mainly in the cortical-
subcortical junction in the left hemisphere, more clear in the temporal area along with a greater anterior-frontal 
extension, at the base and at the convexity, both insular and parietal and surrounded by a big oedema. The further 
multiple foci of signal alteration resulted extended, in number and allocation,  in the  hemispheric area (with T2 and 
FLAIR hyperintensity), observable in the semioval centers bilaterally and mainly in the left side, but particularly

advanced on the right. The hemispheric sulci of the left side were still flatten along with a swollen appearance of 
gyri. Moreover a greater extension of the left subcortical and deep white matter in the left frontal-temporal and 
parietal area. Where all the signal alterations are and especially where the left hemispheric lesions are a diffusion 
restriction was observed as during active phase. The IV contrast medium administration makes visible the strong 
enhancement with a double aspect, both perivenular, punctiform and strongly accentuated outside the frontal 
temporal and left parietal lesion along with a peripheral border. The other findings resulted unchanged and 
especially was stable the lesion burden and lateral ventricles size. The medial structures resulted on axis. Overall, 
the exam showed picture worsening suggesting a development of the PML lesions in terms of number and size. 
Beyond this picture an additional aggressive inflammatory compound was found. The brain MRI performed on 17 
Sep 2014 revealed a decrease of the enhancements outside the frontal temporal and left parietal lesion, with a 
peripheral border, and resulted changed also the homolateral punctiform perivenular component compared to the 
prior exam 03 Sep 2014. The punctiform enhancement of the frontal parietal subcortical and right deep white 
matter resulted reduced, currently at the limit of the segnalation. The other findings resulted stable since no 
significant changes in the signal alterations in FLAIR and T2 weighted were observed in the areas affected by the 
disease, apart from a minimal oedema reduction, more visible as a signal intensity change in the FLAIR sequences.
No changes were observed in DWI diffusion. The sulci puffiness resulted stable. The median structures were on 
axis. Stable the known lesion burden. Overall the exam shows a decrease of the inflammatory component, which 
still shows an aggressive feature when compared to the previous exam. The brain MRI performed on 06 Oct 2014 
revealed the already known hemispheric parenchymal alteration left superficial subcortical, deeply extended 
semioval-periventricular lesion resulted comparable to the previous exam from 17 Sep 2014, involving the frontal-
insular-parietal area with occipital extension, impacting a stable settlement of the cortical arachnoid spaces. In the 
T1weighted images, at basal conditions, the linear lesion signal juxtacortical hyperintensity resulted stable. The 
images acquired after contrast medium administration showed a substantial decrease of the superficial 
parenchymal enhancement, previously described, as a softening of the inflammatory features. Moreover a relative 
decrease of the signal alteration of the smallest contralateral hemispheric parenchymal alterations, already 
described, associated with a further regression of the punctiform enhancements. No parenchymal focal lesions of 
new occurrence were found both in subtentorial and supratentorial area and no further pathological enhancement 
areas were found in the intra axial and extra assail region. The other finding resulted unchanged. In conclusion the 
exam confirmed a picture with a partial but substantial decrease of the inflammatory lesions previously described, 
involving the main hemispheric lesions as well as the smallest focal hemispheric contralateral alterations. There 
were not new pathological findings.
Update 20 Oct 2014: Additional information was received from the neurologist via a MS Standardized PML Data 
Collection Tool. At the time of this report, the patient was alive and residing at home. The patient's height and 
weight at time of PML diagnosis were 162 cm and 65 kg, respectively. The patient tested negative for HIV on an 
unspecified date. The patient s estimated Karnofsky and EDSS scores were assessed to be 90 (able to carry on

normal activity; minor signs or symptoms of disease) and 1.5 on the following dates: Aug 2010 prior to TYSABRI, 
03 Jun 2014 while on TYSABRI, and 11 Aug 2014 at the time of PML diagnosis. A lumbar puncture performed on 
05 Jun 2014 was negative for CSF JCV DNA (local lab). A lumbar puncture performed on 17 Jul 2014 tested 
negative for CSF JCV DNA (local lab), but was positive at 34 copies/mL at (b) (6)  (test date 19 Jul 2014). The date of 
the patient's MRI prior to PML diagnosis was 26 May 2014 (results previously provided). The MRI at the time of 
PML diagnosis was performed on 11 Jul 2014 (results previously provided). The patient was diagnosed with IRIS 
on 03 Sep 2014, determined by clinical symptoms and MRI findings. Clinical symptoms included non-fluent aphasia
picture, ideomotor slowing and apraxia (cognitive/behavioral; onset 03 Sep 2014), right hand sensitive deficit 
hemisyndrome (motor; onset 03 Sep 2014), and aphasia (speech; onset unknown). It was unclear whether the 
patient received corticosteroids pre-IRIS. The patient received the following corticosteroid treatments post-IRIS: 
Solumedrol (methylprednisolone) 1 g IV daily from 05 Sep 2014 to 09 Sep 2014, and Deltacortene (prednisone) 
daily oral taper from 50 mg to 5 mg (presume from 10 Sep 2014 to 18 Oct 2014). On 08 Oct 2014, the patients 
estimated EDSS was 4.0. The patient has not recovered from the events of PML and IRIS. Causality for the events 
was assessed by the neurologist as related to TYSABRI.
Update 16 Feb 2015: Additional information was received from the neurologist via a MS Standardized PML Data 
Collection Tool. At the time of this report, the patient was alive, residing at home, and not on any MS therapy. A 
brain MRI was performed on 12 Feb 2015 with results reported as follows: the current control visit showed a 
reduction in the extension of the known hemispherical signal alteration of the left white matter supratentorial; an 
initial atrophic evolution, especially at the left parietal area, is detected. No new focal parenchymal alteration. After 
contrast medium administration also the enhancement, which maintains point features and it is striped, is reduced. 
The enhancement point at right semioval centre remains unmodified. No documentation of appearance of new 
enhancement in other areas. The neurologist assessed the patient's estimated Karnofsky score to be 70 (cares for 
self; unable to carry on normal activity or to do active work) on 12 Feb 2015. The EDSS score was assessed to be 
4.5 on 09 Feb 2015. Post-PML test results from 12 Nov 2014 were reported: leukocyte count 4.5 x 10(9) [normal 
range 4.8 to 10.8 x 10(9)] and absolute lymphocyte count 2 x 10(9) [normal range 1 to 4.8 x 10(9)]. IRIS was 
diagnosed by clinical symptoms and MRI findings. Clinical symptoms for IRIS included the following: worsening of 
memory deficits (cognitive/behavioral; onset 15 Aug 2014), worsening of right hand hypostenia (focal motor; onset 
15 Aug 2014), worsening of expression aphasia (speech; onset 15 Aug 2014), generalized epileptic seizure with 
epileptiform abnormalities on the left hemisphere (focal seizure; onset 06 Sep 2014), and worsening of right hand 
hypoesthesia (focal sensory; onset 15 Aug 2014). The patient did not receive corticosteroids pre-IRIS. 
Corticosteroid treatment post-IRIS included methylprednisolone and prednisolone (regimens previously reported as 
Solumedrol and Deltacortene; discrepant information - prednisolone regimen does not include 50mg as initial part 
of taper, but starts with 25mg by mouth daily from 10 Sep 2014 to 21 Sep 2014). The patient has recovered with 
sequelae from PML as of 12 Dec 2014, and has recovered from IRIS as of 14 Nov 2014 (brain MRI showed 
marked reduction of the size and enhancement of the inflammatory lesions). Causality for the events was assessed

by the neurologist as related to TYSABRI.
Update 19 Jul 2015: Additional information was received from the neurologist via a MS Standardized PML Data 
Collection Tool. At the time of this report, the patient was alive, residing at home, and not on any MS therapy.  IRIS 
was diagnosed by clinical symptoms and MRI findings. Clinical symptoms for IRIS included the following: worsening
of memory deficits -cognitive / behavioral, worsening of right hand hypostenia - focal motor, worsening of 
expression aphasia - speech, worsening of right hand hypoesthesia -focal sensory (onsets 15 Aug 2014), and 
generalized epileptic seizure with epileptiform abnormalities on the left hemisphere - focal seizure (onset 06 Sep 
2014). The patient did not receive corticosteroids pre-IRIS (previously reported). Corticosteroid treatment post-IRIS 
included methylprednisolone (1 gr, IV, once daily) from 05 Sep 2014 to 09 Sep 2014, prednisolone (25mg by mouth
daily) from 10 Sep 2014 to 21 Sep 2014, prednisolone (previously reported as Deltacortene) 12.5 mg by mouth 
daily from 22 Sep 2014 to 28 Sep 2014, and prednisolone (previously reported as Deltacortene) 5 mg by mouth 
daily from 29 Sep 2014 to 18 Oct 2014. Post-PML test results from 12 Nov 2014 (previously reported): leukocyte 
count 4.5 x 10(9) [normal range 4.8 to 10.8 x 10(9)] and absolute lymphocyte count 2 x 10(9) [normal range 1 to 4.8
x 10(9)]. A brain MRI was performed on 29 Apr 2015 with results reported as follows: compared with the previous 
MRI of 12 Feb2015, the current examination showed a reduction in the extent of the known alteration of the signal 
of the white substance left hemispheric supratentorial; an initial evolution in atrophic way was appreciated especially
in the left temporoparietal area. There is no appearance of new focal parenchymal changes. Reduced, even if 
barely persistent, is the minimum restriction of diffusion to the periphery of the lesion. There are median structures 
in axis, the lateral ventricles in the seat. After the contrast medium no more evidence of pathological enhancement 
areas. The neurologist assessed the patient's estimated Karnofsky score and EDSS score on 29 Apr 2015 to be 70
(cares for self; unable to carry on normal activity or to do active work) and 4.5.The patient has recovered from PML 
as of 12 Nov 2014 (JCV on PCR- negative), and has recovered from IRIS as of 14 Nov 2014 (brain MRI showed 
marked reduction of the size and enhancement of the inflammatory lesions). Causality for the events of PML and 
IRIS was assessed by the neurologist as related to TYSABRI.
