transfusion and erythropoietin. The concomitant medication included ciprofloxacin for prophylaxis, tarnsilate for 
bleeding, metronidazole for diarrhea, medicinal oxygen for dyspnea and orneprazole and  ,! e.- 'ne for unknwon 
indication. The received folic acid, vitamin 812 and dexamethasone as supplementation.therapy. On 14-Aug-2009, 
the patient first-r:... pemetrexed 865 mg, every 21 days, cycle five, intravenously (1V), in .   lion with 
carboplatin, 400.  mg. every 21 days, cycle five, intravenously (IV), bath for treatment of  non-small cell 
lung cancer (NWIX)., 'On 21-Aug-    seven days after beginning the treatment, the patient experienced watery 
diarrhea (five evacuations), not red serious by the investigator, containing food remains. In the dawn of that 
night, she had evacuations with fresh blood and colic pain, before and after evacuations. The investigator stated 
that the patient relatives also said that she presents nose corks. On 25-Aug-2009, 11 days after beginning the 
treatment, the kiNowing laboratory exams were performed: hemoglobin 6.6 g/d1 (normal range 11.5 to 17.0), 
hernatoctit 18.90 % (normal range 37.0 to 54.0), leukocyte 2000 mm3 (normal range 4000 to 10000), platelet 
12000 mm3 (normal .  150000 to 4.0  b  i  1). On 25-Aug-2009, thrombocytopenia was diagnosed. On 26-Aug-
2009, 12 days atter beginning the treatment, the patient relative informed to the investigator by phone, that the 
patient experienced prefuse nose bleeding. On unknown date, the patient went to emergency room (ER) where an 
otolaryngologist inspected her observing nose bleeding and a cauterization with silver nitrate was performed. After 
the cauterization, the patient left the ER and went home. On MEM the patient went hack to ER because 
she presents two   0 e stools and spatialitirne person disorientation. The investigator stated that the patient was 
evaluated in the ER and the patient hospitalization for evaluation and treatment was decided. On the same day that 
thepatient went back to ER,41.11111111 a lower digestive tract hemorrhage was cr  .  ed. It was unknown if 
the patient rem ccoorrrreeccttiivvee  treatment and if she recovered from the event. it was unknown if the patient received 
corrective treatment for the thrombocytopenia but she did not recover from the event. The patient was not 
discharged. On the same day of the hospitalization, the study drugs were permanent discontinued

performed, The investigator considered the acute respiratory insufficiency to be not related to pemetrexed and 
carboplatin, The study investigator stated the event lower digestive tract hemorrhage was related to pemetrexed 
and carheplatin, once that the combination of the drugs causes myelosuppression. No assessment provided for 
protocapr    e. According to the investigator the event thrombocytopenia was related to pemetrexed and 
carbeplatin since that the combination ofdrug causes myelosuppression but was not related to protocol 
procedures. Update on 01-Sep-2009. Additional information received on 01-Sep-2009 from study coordinator was
