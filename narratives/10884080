Medically Significant
A neurologist reported that a female patient on TYSABRI (300 mg, IV, QM) for Multiple Sclerosis from 03 Apr 2008 
to 08 Jun 2010 and enrolled in a Biogen Idec sponsored marketing program of Monitored Therapy was hospitalized 
(dates and reason not provided). TYSABRI therapy was stopped temporarily. No further information was provided.
Update 19 Feb 2015: Upon an inbound return phone call, a health care professional from the neurologist's office 
stated that the patient went to the hospital on (b) (6)  for an intentional overdose of prescription medications 
(NOS) (onset unknown).  The patient was transferred to an inpatient behavioral health clinic later that day. Due to 
such a drastic change in the patient's behavior, the patient was being evaluated for PML suspicion (onset 
unknown).  At the time of this report the TOUCH database indicated that the patient received a total of 56 doses of 
TYSABRI from 03 Apr 2008 to 08 Jun 2010, from 16 Dec 2010 to 22 Mar 2013, and from 09 Apr 2014 to 30 Dec 
2014 (dates of dosing are discrepant from previously reported information). Internal databases indicated the 
following: Newest TOUCH enrollment (Mar 2014) stated that the patient was JCV Ab positive. MS onset: Jan 2007. 
Prior MS therapy: Copaxone (glatiramer) from Mar 2007 to Jan 2008. Immunosuppressant history included 
corticosteroids.  Not enrolled in Stratify studies.  No testing or treatment was reported. The outcome of the events is
unknown and causality of the events in relation to TYSABRI was not assessed. At this time, TYSABRI therapy has 
been withdrawn until PML can be ruled out. 
Update 25 Feb 2015:  Upon an outbound call to the neurologist's office, the same health care professional reported 
that the most recent JCV Ab testing was performed on 30 Dec 2014; result was positive with an index of 1.07.  No 
immunosuppressant history was reported. Last MRI was performed on 07 Apr 2014; findings were stable. LP has 
not been performed. Patient was hospitalized, but under the care of a different medical doctor, so hospital 
discharge summary was not available. After hospital discharge, the patient was scheduled for follow-up office visits 
twice with the neurologist, however, the patient cancelled appointment both times. The neurologist was waiting to 
evaluate the patient to determine if a new MRI was needed, but patient cancelled appointments. A new 
appointment has been scheduled for 09 Mar 2015. According to the health care professional, PML suspicion was 
very low. TYSABRI therapy is on hold until further evaluation with the patient.
