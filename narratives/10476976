MEDICALLY SIGNIFICANT
A neurologist from a University Hospital reported via company employee that a patient on TYSABRI was under 
suspicion for Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML).  Attempts to obtain additional validating 
information were ongoing.
Update 13 Sep 2014: The neurologist from the university hospital reported that a 35-year-old female patient on 
TYSABRI (300 mg, IV, QW) for relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) from 13 Jul 2010 to 04 Aug 2014 
came under suspicion for PML on (b) (6)  On 21 Aug 2014 a brain MRI had been done. According to the 
neurologist, the MRI revealed one contrast enhancing lesion in cerebellum and two very small new lesions without 
enhancing in the medulla oblongata. The MRI record concerning the same MRI indicated that in axial FLAIR the

known lesions in supratentorial region had not changed in number and size. There were new lesions in infratentorial
region, one of them in right medial vermis superior and other ones in pons. In contrast enhancing sequences there 
was a ring-enhancing lesion in the right cerebellum which was rather consistent with MS than with PML. On 26 Aug 
2014 a JC virus DNA PCR test showed 30 copies/mL (laboratory:(b) (6) ). The patient was 
hospitalized from (b) (6)  to (b) (6)  for suspected PML. The reporting neurologist considered the event 
life-threatening and disabling. Treatment included 7 cycles of plasma exchange (PLEX), mirtazapine and 
mefloquine. The event outcome was reported as unknown. Medical history included RRMS since an unknown date.
The patient was JCV antibody positive (test date not provided.) Patient's weight was 52 kg. The patient was not 
taking any concomitant medication. Causality was assessed as unlikely.
Update 08 Oct 2014:  The neurologist provided the following additional information.  The patient was diagnosed 
with MS in 2007.  Previous MS therapies included interferon (NOS).  The patient had no previous 
immunosuppressive treatments.  The suspicion for PML began in Aug 2014 with increasing gait unsteadiness and 
dysarthria.  A "control MRI" (date unknown) did not show any significant changes.
Update 08 Jan 2015: The neurologist provided the following additional information via a Biogen Idec Medical 
Science Liaison (MSL). The cranial MRI from (b) (6)  showed that the lesion load seen on T2-weighted MRI 
was unchanged compared to previous scans. No clear change of the findings located in the pons and cerebellum 
were seen. The clinical course was described as follows: in (b) (6)  the patient had an EDDS of 6.0. She was 
hardly able to walk and was dependent on a walking frame. On 09 Dec 2014, the patient showed an EDDS of 4.5 
and could walk a distance of 500m without walking frame. However, the visual acuity of the patient had slightly 
deteriorated. On 14 Oct 2014, JCV DNA PCR test in CSF determined in Dsseldorf showed 89 copies/ml. At 
present, the patient did not show symptoms of IRIS. Therapy included cortisone and immunoglobulins as required.
Update 09 Jan 2015: The neurologist provided the following additional information via a Biogen Idec MSL. Cranial 
MRI from 28 Oct 2014 showed no change of the previously known T2 weighted periventricular lesions on both 
sides, in the pons on both sides as well as in the middle cerebellar peduncle on the right side and in the cerebellar 
hemispheres (right more than left) compared to the both previous MRI scans. However, in the recent scan again 
slightly increased contrast medium enhancement was seen compared to the scan from 16 Oct 2014. In addition 2 
fresh patchy contrast medium enhancements were seen in the pons paramedian on both sides. Therefore, the 
suspicion of IRIS persisted.  The cranial MRI from 09 Dec 2014 was compared to the MRI from 28 Oct 2014.  The 
T2 weighted lesions in the right cerebellum and cerebellar peduncle, respectively, were slightly regressive 
compared to the previous MRI. But a mild progression in the left cerebellum was seen; additionally, on the left side 
a slightly increased contrast medium enhancement could be seen. The lesions in the brain stem were more sharply
demarcated and showed less contrast medium enhancement. The findings in the brain stem and in the cerebellum 
were consistent with a regressive PML-IRIS.

FOIA Case Report Information
Update 15 Jan 2015:  Biogen Idec considers this case to be confirmed for PML based on positive CSF, consistent 
radiologic evidence, and clinical symptoms.
Update 11 Mar 2015: Additional information was received from the neurologist via a MS Standardized PML Data 
Collection Tool. On 29 Mar 2010, prior to starting TYSABRI, leukocyte count was 4.7 G/L (normal range 4-11 G/L) 
and lymphocyte count was 40 percent (normal range 25-45 percent). On 13 Jul 2010, the patient s estimated 
Karnofsky and EDSS scores, respectively, were 60 (requires occasional assistance, but is able to care for most of 
her personal needs) and 4.5. On 02 May 2011, prior to PML diagnosis, leukocyte count was 6.2 G/L (normal range 
4-11 G/L) and lymphocyte count was 52 percent (normal range 25-45 percent). On 15 Apr 2013, the patient s 
estimated Karnofsky and EDSS scores were 80 (normal activity with effort; some signs or symptoms of disease) 
and 3.5. A brain MRI was performed prior to PML diagnosis on 17 Feb 2014 (results not reported). On 09 Apr 2014,
the patient tested positive for serum anti-JCV antibodies (index 3.554). A brain MRI was performed at time of PML 
diagnosis on 21 Aug 2014 (previously reported). On 25 Aug 2014, the patient s estimated Karnofsky and EDSS 
scores were 70 (cares for self; unable to carry on normal activity or to do active work) and 4.0. On 25 Aug 2014, at 
time of PML (pre-PLEX), leukocyte count was 6.0 G/L (normal range 3.9-11 G/L) and lymphocyte count was 36 
percent (normal range 22-45 percent). On 26 Aug 2014, the patient tested positive for serum anti-JCV antibodies 
(index 3.804). A lumbar puncture was performed on 26 Aug 2014 and was positive for CSF JCV DNA at 30 copies 
per mL (previously reported). A lumbar puncture was performed on 14 Oct 2014 and was positive for CSF JCV 
DNA at 89 copies per mL (previously reported). The patient was diagnosed with IRIS, which was determined by 
clinical symptoms and MRI findings. Clinical symptoms included cerebellar gait disturbance and dizziness 
(cerebellar; diagnosed with PML with worsening in Oct 2014). The patient did not receive corticosteroids pre-IRIS 
onset. The patient received corticosteroids post-IRIS onset; treatment included methylprednisolone 1000 mg IV and
immunoglobulins 20 GM IV, both administered for five days in Oct 2014, and methylprednisolone 1000 mg IV and 
immunoglobulins 30 GM IV, both administered from 09 Dec 2014 to 12 Dec 2014. A lumbar puncture was 
performed on 05 Feb 2015 and was negative for CSF JCV DNA. At the time of this report, the patient was alive and
residing at home. The outcome of the events of PML and IRIS was unknown. Causality for the events of PML and 
IRIS was assessed as related to TYSABRI.
Update 29 Oct 2015:  The life partner of the patient provided the following additional information via a program of 
Monitored Therapy.  The patient was on TYSABRI for 5 years, from 01 Oct 2009 to 30 Sep 2014 (dates discrepant).
 The patient tested positive for JCV DNA in CSF in Sep 2014 (date discrepant, presumed in reference to positive 
CSF from 26 Aug 2014).  The patient was hospitalized in (b) (6)  (dates discrepant) and received PLEX 
(previously reported).  The patient was diagnosed with MS in 2007.  The patient was not taking any concomitant 
medications.  The patient's height and weight were reported as 164cm and 48kg (discrepant) respectively.  Blood 
counts (NOS) in 2015 were without findings.  The consumer assessed causality as related.  The patient started 
PLEGRIDY on 14 Apr 2015.
