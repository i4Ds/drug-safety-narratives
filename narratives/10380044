Medically Significant
A neurologist spontaneously reported via a Biogen Idec Principal Medical Scientist that a 41 year old female patient 
on TYSABRI (300 mg, IV, QOM - note, TOUCH database indicated average of one month between TYSABRI 
doses except for between last two doses) for Multiple Sclerosis from 2011 to 2014 experienced PML (onset 29 Jul 
2014) and MS Relapse (onset 2014). Internal databases provided that the patient was diagnosed with Multiple 
Sclerosis in Jan 2008. Previous MS therapy included Rebif (interferon beta 1a) from Apr 2008 to Feb 2012. At the 
time of this report, the TOUCH database indicated that the patient had received a total of 29 infusions of TYSABRI 
from 24 Feb 2012 to 11 Jun 2014 (dates of dosing are discrepant from reported information). Testing included the 
patient testing positive for JCV antibodies (date unknown) and a spinal tap (date unknown; results not provided). 
Testing also revealed that the patient had 2 brain lesions (date unknown). Treatment for the events was not 
provided, and the events of PML and MS Relapse are ongoing. Causality for the events of PML and MS Relapse is 
unknown.  TYSABRI therapy was discontinued.
Update 01 Aug 2014: Upon telephone follow-up, a registered nurse from the neurologist's office reported that the 
patient had a worsened progression of MS symptoms described as a worsened MS hug (presumed reference to 
previous report of MS Relapse). Treatment included Solu-Medrol (methylprednisolone). A lumbar puncture was 
performed on 17 Jul 2014 (results not provided; sent to(b) (6) ) and the patient was referred to a new MS specialist 
(consultation on 31 Jul 2014). An MRI performed on 21 Jul 2014 showed C spine and T spine stable with 1 new 
brain lesion. A previous MRI on 22 Apr 2014 did not show this lesion. The nurse was unsure whether the patient 
had prior immunosuppressant therapy. Per the patient's chart, the patient tested positive for JCV antibodies since 
starting TYSABRI. The patient's first JCV antibody test on 11 Feb 2012 was positive.
Update 04 Aug 2014: Upon telephone follow-up with the consulting neurologist, the neurologist reported that he has
diagnosed the patient with PML. CSF results were positive for JCV DNA (658 copies/ml; testing at (b) (6)  
presumed reference to lumbar puncture on 17 Jul 2014). Also, the patient had an abnormal MRI lesion consistent 
with PML: large lesion, white matter, localized in right occipital lobe (presumed reference to MRI from 21 Jul 2014). 
The neurologist noted that the patient was somewhat asymptomatic except for what seems to be a slight, general 
infection (NOS) (onset unknown). The neurologist stated that the infection seems to be an incidental finding. No 
treatment is being given for the infection, and the outcome was not provided. The patient is at home and has not 
been hospitalized for this event. Treatment for PML is scheduled to begin today as an outpatient and will include 
granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) and probably anti-seizure medications (NOS). PLEX therapy will not 
be administered. The neurologist reported that they will watch for IRIS and, if it develops, steroids (NOS) will be 
administered. The consulting neurologist will now being the patient's treating neurologist.
Update 08 Aug 2014: A TOUCH Re-authorization Questionnaire was received from the prescibing neuroloigst 
which noted that the patient had been diagnosed with PML. Additionally, it was noted that the patient had tested

positive for the presence of anti-JCV antibodies sometime since 25 Feb 2014. The TOUCH form also indicated that
the patient had received 1 intermittent course of steroids in the last 6 months for the treatment of MS Relapse 
(presumed reference to previously reported treatment with Solu-medrol) and had not received any 
immunomodulatory or immunosuppressant therapy in the previous 6 months. No further information was provided.
Update 14 Aug 2014: Upon follow-up with the consulting/now treating neurologist's office, a registered nurse 
reported that the female patient's most recent JCV index was 2.7 (date not provided). The results of the spinal test 
JCV PCR was 658 vc (presume viral copies) on 22 Jul 2014 (date discrepant, previously reported as 17 Jul 2014). 
MRI reports were also provided, which showed the following:  22 Feb 2013: MRI = The appearance is relatively 
unchanged from the 02 Oct 2012 exam; no enhancing lesions are identified to suggest active demyelination. The 
overall disease burden is mild. 26 Jul 2013: MRI brain w/w-out contrast = report not received. 26 Jul 2013: MRI C-
spine w/w-out contrast (compared to Feb and Jun 2012 MRIs) = The previously questioned lesions in the left 
aspect of the cord at the C4 level and the C4-5 level are not as well demonstrated on the current exam secondary 
to artifact. There are no definite new T2/STIR signal lesions in the cervical cord. No enhancing lesions are seen in 
the cervical spinal cord to suggest active demyelination. 10 Dec 2013: MRI Brain w/w-out contrast (compared to 26 
Jul 2013) = Multiple supra and infratentorial WM lesions are again demonstrated, c/w the known demyelinating 
disease. The appearance is relatively unchanged from the 26 Jul 2013 exam. No enhancing lesions are identified to
suggest active demyelination. The overall disease burden is mild. 10 Dec 2013: MRI c-spine w/w-out contrast 
(compared to 26 Jul 2013) = No significant change from previous MRI; no abnormal cord signal or enhancement. 
21 Jul 2014: MRI brain w/w-out contrast (compared to 22 Apr 2014) = 1) Multiple foci of nonenhancing hyperintense
T2/FLAIR signal are reidentified w/in the WM, comparable w/demylinating plaques, given the patient s hx of MS. A 
small new nonenhancing lesion is identified w/in the R frontal WM, compatible w/a new demyelinating lesion 
compared to the 22 Apr 2014 exam.  2) The new ill-defined areas of hyperintense T2/FLAIR  signal w/in the 
subcortical WM of the R insular region and lateral R frontal lobe are nonspecific, however, remains concerning for 
PML, given pt s hx w/Tysabri tx. Clinical correlation and continued follow-up imaging recommended. 21 Jul 2014: 
MRI c-spine w/w-out contrast (compared to 22 Apr 2014 and 18 Feb 2012) = Stable MRI exam of c and t spine 
w/out definite evidence of abnormal cord signal or enhancement; no significant spinal canal or neural foraminal 
stenosis at any level w/in the cervicothoracic spine. 04 Aug 2014: MRI brain w/w-out contrast = 1) Multiple small 
T2/FLAIR hyperintensities w/in the periventricular WM, bilateral frontal lobes, and right basal ganglia region 
consistent w/demyelinating lesions. 2) Confluent nonenhancing T2/FLAIR hyperintense lesion in the R insula and 
frontal lobe is concerning for PML. Correlation w/earlier imaging, continued FU recommended. 08 Aug 2014: MRI 
brain w/w-out contrast (compared to 04 Aug 2014 MRI) = No significant change. The confluent, non-enhancing T2 
hyperintense lesion involving the subcortical WM in the R frontal lobe insula is unchanged and is again consistent 
w/PML. The rest of the demyelinating plaques are also stable. No new lesion or abnormal enhancement. 14 Aug 
2014: MRI brain w/w-out contrast (compared to 08 Aug 2014 MRI) = Compared to the previous MRI, there is an 
interval increase in the size of the confluent lesion in the subcortical WM in the R frontal lobe and insula. No

abnormal enhancement. Images consistent w/ PML. The rest of the demyelinating plaques are stable.
Update 21 Aug 2014: Biogen Idec considers this case to be confirmed for PML based on positive JCV DNA, 
consistent detailed MRI findings, and clinical symptoms present.
Update 12 Sep 2014: Information was received via a poster presented at the 2014 Joint Annual Meeting of the 
Americas Committee for Treatment and Research in Multiple Sclerosis (ACTRIMS) and the European Committee 
for Treatment and Research in Multiple Sclerosis (ECTRIMS), Boston, MA. Stefoski D, Balabanov R, Ko M, Strong 
J, Hernandez C, Muth C, Mercurio M, Javed A (September 2014). Fifteen non-fatal outcomes in natalizumab-
associated PML/IRIS: the effects of early diagnosis and evolving novel therapeutic approaches. The authors 
reported 15 patients with MS with PML occurring after 14-70 months of natalizumab treatments as well as 2 
additional PML patients in early phases of treatment and recovery.  This case references a patient in the early 
phases of treatment and recovery.  No new information was reported. A corresponding abstract (P858) was 
published in the Multiple Sclerosis Journal 20 (S2) 2014. Retrieved from msj.sagepub.com.
Update 01 Jul 2015: A report was received via literature: Surgical management of malignant cerebral edema 
secondary to immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome from natalizumab-associated progressive multifocal 
encephalopathy. Tan LA, Lopes DK. J Clin Neurosci. 2015 Jun 24. pii: S0967-5868(15)00230-1. doi: 
10.1016/j.jocn.2015.05.003. [Epub ahead of print]. Additional information was provided for this confirmed PML 
case. Once the natalizumab-associated PML was established, TYSABRI was discontinued and she was treated on 
filgrastim (G-CSF) (5 mg/kg, QD) for 5 days. She subsequently developed 4/5 mild left hemiparesis with 
enlargement of the brain lesions on MRI, consistent with IRIS. Shen was then treated with methylprednisolone, (500
mg, IV) for 3 days, and showed an improvement in symptoms. She was discharged to a rehabilitation facility in a 
stable condition. However, 2 months later she presented with worsening weakness on her left side and an altered 
mental status. Despite a course of high dose steroid treatment, her examination results continued to worsen and 
the neurosurgery department was consulted at this time. On neurological exam, she was somnolent with left 
hemiplegia. Brain CT scans showed diffuse right side cerebral edema with significant midline shift. MRI of the brain 
demonstrated malignant cerebral edema with enlargement of the previous PML-IRIS related lesions. Given the 
progressive deterioration in her neurological status and the presence of malignant cerebral edema, she was taken 
to the operating room immediately and underwent a right decompressive hemicraniectomy. She tolerated the 
procedure well without any complications. The postoperative CT scan showed significant improvement in the mass 
effect and midline shift. She gradually improved clinically, with increasing strength on her left side. A cranioplasty 
was performed 3 months after the initial hemicraniectomy, without any complications. She was doing well clinically 
at the 4 month follow-up visit with 4+/5 strength on the left side.
