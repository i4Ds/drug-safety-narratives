Medically Significant
A neurologist reported that a female patient on TYSABRI (300 mg, IV, QM) for Multiple Sclerosis since an unknown
date was diagnosed with PML suspicion in Sep 2013.
According to the neurologist, brain MRI performed on an unknown date showed predominantly cerebellar lesions 
very PML suggestive in this paucisymptomatic patient. Lumbar puncture was performed on an unknown date 
(pending result) and plasma exchanges were planned shortly.
At the time of reporting, the outcome for the event PML suspicion was unknown. TYSABRI treatment was 
withdrawn.
No further information was provided.

On 10 Oct 2013
The neurologist reported that the patient was 53 year old. MS first symptoms appeared in May 1999 and MS was 
diagnosed in Nov 1999. MS symptoms presented by the patient were fatigue, mild paraparesis, slight ataxia, slight 
decreased proprioception in the 4 limbs. Karnofsky score at TYSABRI initiation on 23 Jan 2009 was  80 and EDSS 
was 2.5. Previous MS medication included Betaferon from Nov 2005 to Dec 2008 and no prior immunosuppresive 
agent was given. TYSABRI was initiated on 23 Jan 2009 and stopped on 26 Aug 2013 due to PML suspicion, 61 
infusions in total. PML suspicion was based on MRI imaging only, MRI monitoring being scheduled every 3 months.
Patient was asymptomatic. 2 brain MRIs were performed on 29 Jun 2013 and on 21 Sep 2013. On first one a T2 
lesion in left middle cerebellar peduncle was seen a posteriori while analyzing MRI result of 21 Sep 2013, where 
hypoT1 and hyperDWI lesion was seen. It was assessed as PML suggestive. Regarding PML risk factors, anti-JCV 
antibodies returned positive in an unknown date, furthermore, the patient had more than 2 years of treatment. A 
lumbar puncture was done on 21 Sep 2013, local JCV PCR testing returned positive with 259 000 copies/mL. Other
CSF analysis showed an absence of cells in CSF, glucose at 0.72 g/L, protein at 0.29 g/L. PML was diagnosed by 
the neurologist who assessed the event as related to TYSABRI. Outcome was ongoing. No IRIS was reported. 
Corrective treatment included Mirtazapine (15mg, QD) initiated on 30 Sep 2013 and 5 plasmapheresis  (first one 
occured on 23 Sep 2013). At the time of reporting, the patient was at home with no need of support. EDSS score 
prior to PML (on 11 Feb 2013) and at the time of PML diagnosis (3 Oct 2013) remained stable at 3 whereas 
Karnofsky score decreased from 80 on 11 Feb 2013 to 60 on 03 Oct 2013. At the time of reporting, PML suspicion 
remained asymptomatic. However the patient presented with anxiety and depression secondary to PML 
occurrence.

Biogen Idec considers this case to be confirmed PML based on positive JCV in CSF, MRI findings and symptoms.
On 23 Oct 2013
The French Health Authorities (ANSM via CRPV of Lille) reported this case under reference LL20131304. It was 
stated that the patient received Sotalex, Athymil and Rivotril from Jan 2006 to Feb 2009 in combination with 
Betaferon before she was switched to TYSABRI. The event was assessed as life-threatening.

Philadelphia, PA. 25 Apr 2014. The objective was to describe JCV serology and one year index follow-up in a 
natalizumab treated patient cohort. According to recent studies, index value of JCV serology might be a new 
potential risk factor for better stratification of the risk of PML occurrence during natalizumab therapy. This case 
involves a female patient, on TYSABRI (natalizumab) for 5 years (dosing dates and dosing regimen unknown) for 
relapsing remitting Multiple Sclerosis. The patient developed PML in Oct 2013 (5 years of treatment) which was 
diagnosed at pre-clinical stage. Medical history, concomitant medications, and prior MS therapy were not reported 
by the authors. The patient had high index value during all of the follow-up (2.344, 2.823) but no increase of index 
value at the time of PML diagnosis was observed (2.488). Mean index values was in May 2012 and May 2013 (1.09
 1.08 and 1.10   1.04). The authors concluded that high index value might be a new factor in natalizumab 
associated PML risk stratification but needs to be discussed on a case by case basis as to whether natalizumab 
should be discontinued. In this case, increasing index value before PML diagnosis was not observed. The outcome 
of the event of PML is unknown. Causality was assessed as related to natalizumab. Disposition of TYSABRI 
therapy is unknown. French Imputability: C2S2I2]
Update 19 Sep 2014 and 25 Sep 2014: Additional information received from the neurologist indicated that the 
patient is enrolled in the (b) (6)  Protocol (b) (6)  The 
neurologist reported via a follow-up TYGRIS data collection tool (DCT), dated 17 Jan 2014, that the patient is alive 
and still under his care. Since submission of the previous TYGRIS DCT, the patient was diagnosed with 
progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy; was not hospitalized for other infections including opportunistic 
infections; was not diagnosed with a malignancy; and did not experience any serious adverse events. It was also 
reported that the patient was treated with 5 courses of steroids due to an MS relapse since the submission of the 
previous TYGRIS DCT. No new medications were administered and the patient is not taking any 
immunomodulatory or immunosuppressant products. The patient's pregnancy status was reported as negative. 
Anti-JCV antibody testing was not performed since the last TYGRIS DCT was submitted. TYSABRI therapy was not
re-started since it was discontinued on 26 Aug 2013 due to PML suspicion which was subsequently confirmed.
Update 16 Dec 2014: Additional information was received from a physician via a MS Standardized PML Data 
Collection Tool. The patient is alive, residing in a nursing home, and is not currently on any MS therapy. The 
physician assessed the patient s estimated Karnofsky score on 10 Dec 2014 to be 50 (requires considerable 
assistance and frequent medical care). EDSS was not evaluated. A brain MRI was performed on 08 Oct 2014 with 
results reported as follows: lesional stability; absence of new contrast enhancements, with the caveat of it being an 
exam with artifacts and a non-interpretable posterior fossa. A brain MRI was also performed on 11 Aug 2014 with 
results reported as lesional stability and slight bulging increase around the left midline. The patient was diagnosed 
with IRIS (onset and treatment not provided). As of 25 Nov 2014, the patient had not recovered from PML. As of 27 
Dec 2013, the patient had recovered from IRIS. Causality for the events of PML and IRIS was assessed as related 
to TYSABRI.

Update 09 Sep 2015: A report was received from literature.  Hodel J, Outteryck O, Verclytte S, Deramecourt V, 
Lacour A, Pruvo J-P, Vermersch P, and Leclerc X.  Brain magnetic susceptibility changes in patients with 
natalizumab-associated progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy.  American Journal of Neuroradiology; 27 Aug 
2015.  doi: 10.3174/ajnr.A4436.  This case is in reference to the patient number 1, a 52 year old female patient.
The patient was on TYSABRI therapy for relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis for a total of 56 months of exposure. 
On an unknown date, the patient's cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was positive for JCV DNA.  The patient had 6 available
MRIs (dates and results not reported), covering the "pre-symptomatic to chronic stage". The patient had both 
susceptibility weighted imaging and T2 weighted imaging.  The PML lesions found in the left middle cerebellar 
peduncle (MCP) was adjacent to basal ganglia.  There was no low-signal intensity within the U-fibers.  There was 
low signal in the deep gray matter located at left dentate nucleus The time of detection of the susceptibility-weighted
signal abnormality was noted as "pre-symptomatic and after". In 2 patients (patients(b)(6)  and
(b)
(6) ), PML was confined 
to the middle cerebellar peduncle. PML lesion included 1 with an infratentorial lesion (patient 1), and 1 with both 
supra- and infratentorial lesions (patient (b)(6) ).
