A neurologist spontaneously reported that a male patient on TYSABRI (300 mg, IV, QM) for an unknown indication 
from Oct 2010 to Jan 2015 was hospitalized (dates not provided) for a confirmed diagnosis of PML (onset 
unknown).  The patient had received a total 51 TYSABRI infusions before PML diagnosis with last infusion in Jan 
2015.  Approximately a week ago (presume sometime in early Feb 2015), the patient presented to a hospital with 
fever and fluctuating level of consciousness. Subsequently, the patient was transferred to another hospital.  JCV 
DNA (presume Feb 2015) was detected in CSF. A total of 2 MRI examinations at intervals of 2-3 days (presume 
Feb 2015) were conducted; findings were atypical for PML (more like encephalopathy). Plasmapheresis therapy 
cycles were currently ongoing. Current clinical symptoms of the patient included: severe hemiplegic symptoms, 
speech disorder, and ongoing fluctuating level of consciousness. Overall status [of the patient] was classified by the
neurologist as "bad."  Currently, there was no evidence of PML-IRIS.  The outcome for the event PML is unknown. 
The causality for the event of PML is unknown.  TYSABRI therapy was discontinued.

52 year old male patient with a baseline diagnosis of RRMS had received a total of 52 TYSABRI infusions 
(correction to previously reported number of 51 infusions).  On(b) (6)  the patient presented with difficulties 
to concentrate, confusion, and fever.  During patient's hospitalization, deterioration was observed in terms of 
fluctuation of vigilance and higher grade hemiplegia on the left side.  CSF testing on (b) (6)  showed 8 cells, 
glucose, lactate, and total protein in normal ranges.  According to medical records, herpes PCR (date unknown) 
was negative.  JCV antibody results was pending, however the patient was JCV-Ab positive in the frame of 
evaluation of the introduction of natalizumab therapy.  The patient was transferred from the partner clinic on (b) (6)  
(b) (6)   MRI images from 08 May 2014, 11 Feb 2015, and 19 Feb 2015 were provided (MRI report not provided).
Update 10 Mar 2015:  Additional information was received from the initial reporting neurologist via a MS PML Data 
Collection Form: Suspect.  The patient's initials and age were provided.  The patient on TYSABRI from 11 Jan 2011
(date discrepant) to 16 Jan 2015 for a total of 52 infusions (therapy was not interrupted for greater than 3 months) 
was being evaluated for PML due to clinical signs and symptoms which prompted MRI which revealed suspicious 
findings.  The patient was currently in the intensive care unit.  The patient experienced first MS symptoms in Mar 
2003 and was diagnosed with MS in Aug 2003.  MS disease symptoms prior to suspected PML included paresis of 
the right leg, maximum walking distance reduced to 500m (motor) (onset Nov 2010), balance/gait disturbance 
(cerebellar) (onset unknown), sensory loss in both legs and both arms (initially reversible after corticosteroids) 
(sensory/multifocal) (onset Mar 2003), and urinary incontinence, burning pain in the legs (other) (onset Nov 2010). 
The patient has never received prior immunosuppressant therapy; however, immunomodulatory therapy included 
Avonex (30 ug, SC, QW) for RRMS from 15 Dec 2003 to Dec 2010.  Signs and symptoms which led to the 
evaluation for possible PML included confusion, difficulties in concentrating (cognitive/behavioral) (onset (b) (6)  
(b) (6) ), left-sided hemiparesis, neglect, progredient drowsiness (motor/focal) (onset (b) (6) ), and dysarthria 
(speech) (onset (b) (6) ). MRIs at the time of suspected PML diagnosis were performed on (b) (6) . (b)(6)  
, and (b) (6)  and a MRI prior to suspected PML diagnosis was performed on 08 May 2014 (results 
not reported).  The following lumbar punctures were performed:  on (b) (6)  - CSF sample was tested at a 
local lab on (b) (6)  and CSF JCV DNA result was unknown (n.d. presume not determined was noted for copy 
number); on 12 Feb 2015 - CSF sample was tested on (b) (6)  at a local lab and CSF JCV DNA result was 
positive (8.4 x 10^4 copies/mL); and on 25 Feb 2015 - CSF sample was tested on 25 Feb 2015 at a local lab and 
CSF JCV DNA result was positive (2.3 x 10^3 copies/mL).  The patient tested positive for serum anti-JCV antibody 
on 20 Nov 2012 at (b) (6) .  A brain biopsy was not performed. Test results prior to starting TYSABRI on 11 Jan 
2011 included the following:  leukocyte count of 5.25 G/l (normal range 4.4-11.3), lymphocyte count of 22% (normal
range 20-40%), and an absolute lymphocyte count of 1.2 G/l (normal range 1.0-4.8).  Test results on TYSABRI 
prior to PML suspicion on 16 Jan 2015 included the following: leukocyte count of 9.80 G/l, lymphocyte count of 
26%, and an absolute lymphocyte count of 2.6 G/l.  Test results at the time of PML suspicion on 13 Feb 2015 
included the following: leukocyte count of 8.36 G/l, lymphocyte count of 13%, and absolute lymphocyte count of 1.1 
G/l.  The following CSF analyses were performed: on (b) (6)  results were abnormal with 8cells/l, glucose

in normal ranges); on (b) (6)  results were abnormal with 29cells/l (lymphocytes and monocytes), glucose 
61mg/dl, lactate 1.7mmol/l, protein 34mg/dl; and on (b) (6)  results were abnormal with 155cells/ l 
(lymphocytes and monocytes), glucose 56mg/dl, lactate 2.4 mmol/l, protein 95mg/dl. Treatment for PML included 5 
sessions of PLEX (total volume: 251 Octaplas (fresh frozen plasma) on (b) (6)  (volume 51), (b) (6)  (51 
volume), (b) (6)  (volume 51), (b) (6)  (volume 51), and (b) (6)  (volume 51) and mefloquine, 
mirtazapine, methylprednisolone, mannitol, and maraviroc.  The patient has never been and is not currently 
enrolled in a Biogen Idec Clinical Trial or non-Biogen Idec Clinical Trial.  At the time of this report, PML had not 
been ruled out.  The neurologist reported that the patient's clinical status was unfortunately not improving.
TYSABRI therapy was stopped on (b) (6)
Update 19 Mar 2015:  Upon internal review, this case has been confirmed for PML based on positive CSF, 
consistent radiological findings, and clinical symptoms.
Update 15 Jun 2015: Additional information was received from neurologist via a MS Standardized PML Data 
Collection Tool. The patient is alive and residing at a nursing home. The patient's height and weight at time of PML 
diagnosis was 174 centimeters and 108 kilograms. TYSABRI is considered to be the suspect product at dose of 
300 mg.  The patient had received a total of 52 doses of TYSABRI.  The patients estimated Karnofsky and EDSS 
scores on 07 Dec 2010 (prior to starting suspect product) were 50 (requires considerable assistance and frequent 
medical care) and 4.0. Test results prior to starting suspect product on 11 Jan 2011: leukocyte count 5.25 g/l 
(normal range 4.4-11.3), lymphocyte count 22% (normal range 20-40), and absolute lymphocyte count 1.2 g/l 
(normal range 1.0-4.8). The patient's estimated Karnofsky and EDSS scores on (b) (6)  (on suspect product 
prior to PML) were 50 (requires considerable assistance and frequent medical care) and 4.0. Test results on 
suspect product prior to PML on (b) (6)  leukocyte count 8.88 g/l (normal range 4.4-11.3), lymphocyte count 
17% (normal range 20-40), and absolute lymphocyte count 1.5 g/l (normal range 1.0-4.8).  MRIs prior to PML 
diagnosis were performed on (b) (6)  to (b) (6)  (results not provided). PML symptoms included fever 
(onset (b) (6) ); cognitive/behavioral - organic psycho-syndrome (onset (b) (6) ); speech - fluctuated 
from no verbal expression to disorder of fluent speech (onset (b) (6) ); seizure - focal - focal motor seizures 
with secondary generalization (onset (b) (6) ); and motor-multifocal - deterioration of left sided hemiparesis 
(onset (b) (6) ). A MRI at time of PML diagnosis was performed on (b) (6)  (results not provided). Test 
results at time of PML (pre-PLEX) on (b) (6)  leukocyte count 10.01 g/l (normal range 4.4-11.3), lymphocyte 
count 10% (normal range 20-40), and absolute lymphocyte count 1.0 g/l (normal range 1.0-4.8). The patient tested 
positive (1.3 E+03) for anti-JCV antibody test on (b) (6)  A lumbar puncture was performed on (b) (6)
with positive < LOD (level of detection) CSF JCV DNA result on (b) (6)  at a local lab.  The patient's estimated 
Karnofsky and EDSS scores on (b) (6)  (at time of PML diagnosis) were 20 (very sick; hospital admission 
necessary; active supportive treatment necessary) and 9.0.  Treatment included methylprednisolone (500 mg, IV,
