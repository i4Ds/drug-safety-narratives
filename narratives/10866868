A medical doctor reported that a patient on TYSABRI (300 mg, IV, QM) for Multiple Sclerosis from unknown date to 
unknown date experienced suspected PML (onset unknown).  At an unknown date TYSABRI was discontinued due
to high titers of JC-virus (>3). Three to four months after discontinuing TYSABRI, the patient developed unspecified
symptoms and the following MRI did not indicate a MS relapse but PML.  At an unknown date an LP was performed
to test JCV-DNA.  The test result was negative. The patient was at report date feeling well and the physician 
believed that the PML was discovered early. The outcome for the event suspected PML is unknown. The causality 
for the event of suspected PML is unknown.  TYSABRI therapy was discontinued.
Update 04 Nov 2014: Follow-up information was received from a physician.  The patient was further identified as a 
female patient who developed MS in 2009 with first signs of opticus neuritis. The patient had a medical history of 
anxiety. The patient was treated with Copaxone (glatiramer acetate) until 2012 when the patient was switched to

TYSABRI. On 31 Mar 2014 the TYSABRI treatment was discontinued due to high JCV antibody titers (3.5). On 20 
May 2014 the patient developed opticus neuritis.  On 01 Jul 2014, the patient was prescribed Gilenya (fingolimod). 
On (b) (6)  the patient visit the hospital due to anxiety and numbness in an arm and a foot. Initially TIA 
(transient ischemic attack) was suspected, then PML (anxiety, numbness, and TIA not considered adverse events 
as they occurred outside the 90 day post-TYSABRI timeframe). The patient discontinued Gilenya (date not 
provided). MRIs were performed on 21 Mar 2014, 04 Jun 2014, (b) (6)  21 Oct 2014 and 02 Nov 2014. The 
MRI was sent to neuroradiologist on the 01 Oct 2014. The radiologist stated that already on the scans from 04 Jun 
2014, there were changes visible that did not indicate MS-relapse, but rather PML, due to changes towards cortex. 
Two lumbar punctures were performed to analyze CSF for JCV-DNA. Both test results were negative. According to 
the physician the patient has PML due to a strong suspicion from the radiological findings. On the MRI 21 Oct 2014 
there is no further progression but rather a regression of the findings. The physician classed the relationship 
between the event and TYSABRI as related. At report date the patient was treated with malaria treatment (NOS).
Update 15 Dec 2014: Additional information was provided via a Biogen Idec employee (MSL) who stated that no 
additional lumbar punctures were performed. 
Update 06 Feb 2015: Follow-up information was received from the neurologist via a Suspect PML Data Collection 
Form. The patient was further identified via date of birth and initials. MS was diagnosed on 23 Jul 2009.  MS 
disease symptoms prior to suspect PML included optic neuritis (onset 17 Mar 2009), paresthesia foot, feet, hand 
(transitory; onset 13 Sep 2009) and fatigue (onset 04 Nov 2011). The patient has not received any prior 
immunosuppressant therapy. Immunomodulatory therapy received included Copaxone (glatiramer), IVIG 
(immunoglobulin), and Gilenya (fingolimod; 01 Jul 2014 to 29 Sep 2014).
Suspect product was confirmed to be TYSABRI (300 mg, IV, every month) administered from 23 Apr 2012 to 31 
Mar 2014. The patient did not experience an interruption of the suspect product for greater than three months. The 
patient was evaluated for PML due to clinical signs and symptoms which prompted MRI which reveald suspicious 
findings. Signs and symptoms included dysarthria (transitory; onset 20 Sep 2014) and paresthesia left hand (onset 
20 Sep 2014). MRI prior to suspected PML was performed on 26 Mar 2014. MRI at the time of suspect PML was 
performed on 22 Sep 2014. Serum anti-JCV antibody status was positive on 16 Nov 2011 (index not provided) and 
31 Mar 2014 (index 3.543), performed by (b) (6)  Prior to starting TYSABRI, on 23 Apr 2012, leukocyte count was 
10.3 (reference range 3.5-8.8). While on TYSABRI, prior to PML suspicion, on 01 Jul 2014, leukocyte count was 
6.7 (reference range 3.5-8.8) and lymphocyte count was 0.8 (reference range 1.1-4.8). At the time of PML 
suspicion (pre-PLEX), on 20 Sep 2014, leukocyte count was 7.3 (reference range 3.5-8.8). CSF JCV DNA results, 
on samples drawn 01 Oct 2014 and 28 Oct 2014, and tested at the local lab were negative. CSF analysis on 01 Oct
2014 was abnormal (NOS). Brain biopsy has not been performed. The patient has not received plasma exchange 
(PLEX) or immunoadsorption. PML treatment included mefloquine (03 Oct 2014 to 01 Dec 2014). The patient is

currently at home. Based on the evaluation of the neurologist, PML has not been ruled out and is considered 
related to TYSABRI.
Update 10 Feb 2015: Follow-up information received from the neurologist provided MRI images from the following 
dates: 08 July 2009, 16 Jul 2009, 13 Oct 2009, 12 Feb 2010, 10 Mar 2011 (Neck and Brain), 24 Jan 2012 (Neck 
and Brain), 04 Jun 2014, 22 Sep 2014, 21 Oct 2014, 03 Dec 2014, 12 Jan 2015.
Update 10 Feb 2015: Follow-up information received included MRI reports. MRI on 24 Jan 2012 showed three 
lesions sub cortically and periventricular that are new or are more visible on the scan today compared to the scan 
performed on the 10 Mar 2011. Some lesions are less visible on today?s scan. No barrier damage that indicate 
ongoing activity. Slight progress.  MRI Medulla was as before plaques are visible in C2 and C4 level. Possible slight
barrier damage in C2 level, on changed compared to examination on the 10 Mar 2011. No new lesions. No other 
barrier damage. Unchanged status.  MRI of the brain on the 26 Mar 2014 showed three GD+ enhanced lesions. 
Previous week symptoms from left eye where eye specialist finds signs for left sided retro bulbar neuritis.  MRI on 
04 Jun 2014 showed, since last examination (26 mar 2014) new diffuse MS?plaque sub cortically frontotemporal on
the right side. Significant progress in size in earlier described MS?related lesions, partly confluently on the left in 
pons, but also several new small lesions in pons as well as cerebral bilaterally. The lesion in the left thalamus has 
increased some in size. Also some new small lesions periventricular mostly on the right side. Currently a spread 
contrast enhancement is seen in one of the lesions parietally left sub cortically and in pons in the median line. 
Progress and signs of activity. At that time, the patient was also noted to have medical history of depression.  MRI 
on 22 Sep 2014 showed on hemo sensitive sequences no signs of bleeding or residues after bleeding. On T2 
weighted sequences shows progress with high signal frotoparetial on the right side. Previous MRI showed slightly 
increased signal with diffusion sequences and slightly decreased signal on ADC mapping and increased signal on 
T2 weighted sequence. This could relate to a relatively new infarction. This area is now more demarked with a high 
signal on periphery and low signal centrally on diffusion sequences with high signal on ADC mapping and T2 
weighted sequences without contrast enhancement. Is interpreted primarily as status after infraction changes. As 
earlier frotoparetial on the left side is increased signal on diffusion sequences, ADC mapping and T2 weighted 
sequenses without contrast enhancement as after ischemia. As earlier there are small periventricular changes and 
extensive small changes in pons bilaterally with high signal on T2 weighted sequences similar to MS?changes. As 
earlier there are extensive changes frontally on the left side juxa cortically on the same level with ventrally corner of 
left side ventricle, changes dorsally of back horn of left side ventricle and juxa cortically changes paretially dorsally 
bilaterally similar to MS?changes. Examination with iv contrast showed no pathologically contrast enhancement 
within the brain parenchyme. No signs of active MS?Plaque. No enlargement of the ventrikel system. No free fluids 
in sinuses or middle ear. As earlier there are extensive MS?changes bilaterally without contrast enhancement and 
no signs of activity. The area frontoparietally on the right side cortically can primarily be interpreted as status after 
infarction. At that time, the patient was noted to have also undergone CT skull which showed frontoparietal on the

left side a 3 cm poorly defined low attenuated area of unclear genes.  MRI of the brain on 30 Sep 2014 gave 
suspicion of PML. The patient had been complaining of effected vision and was admitted from psychiatric care after
suspicion of TIA on the 20 Sep 2014 due to blurred speech.  MRI on 21 Oct 2014 showed no proof for ischemia, no
new changes since last examination on the 22 Sep 2014. The previous mentioned diffuse signal changes that has 
been interpreted as PML has an unchanged spreading. The signal increase is not as marked as before and no 
contrast enhancement can be identified during today?s examination. Therefor no progress of PML, possibly a 
regress. Except that an unchanged status.  MRI on 03 Dec 2014 showed extensive periventricular and juxa 
cortically changes which is interpreted as PML and these are unchanged in relation to size and numbers. Extensive 
changes as before in pons. As before on T2 weighted sequences there are changes with increased signal cortically 
parietally on the right side. On diffusion sequences, no signs of current infarction changes. Examination with 
contrast enhancement no pathological enhancement. No tumor changes or MS?Plaque. No enlargement of the 
ventricle system. No free fluids in sinus or middle ear. Unchanged status.  MRI on 12 Jan 2015 showed unchanged 
status from earlier described lesions from demyelinating disease and PML. No proven regress or progress. No new
lesions. No barrier damage.
Update 19 Feb 2015: Biogen Idec considers this case high suspect and final call for PML based on presence of 
radiologic evidence but negative CSF on 2 occasions.
