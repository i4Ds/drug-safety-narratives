Medically Significant
A neurologist spontaneously reported that a 58 year old female patient on TYSABRI (unknown dose, IV, unknown 
frequency) for Multiple Sclerosis from unknown date 4 years ago (exact start date not provided) to unknown date 
experienced PML suspicion (onset unknown) and memory disorders 10 days ago (onset Dec 2014).  Neurology 
assessment showed aphasic disorders and possible optic agnosia, with no paresis.  The patient tested positive for 
anti-JCV antibodies (date of test and index unknown).  A brain MRI (date unknown) showed a left angular extended
lesion suspect for PML to the left-sided temporal-occipital and parietal lobe.  No treatment was reported. The 
outcome for the events PML suspicion and memory disorders is unknown. The causality for the events of PML 
suspicion and memory disorders is unknown.  It is unknown if TYSABRI treatment is ongoing.
Update 30 Dec 2014:  Additional information was provided by the neurologist.  Results for JCV DNA detection test

were received. Test was performed on 30 Dec 2014 in a local lab and the patient was found positive (187 copies). 
Update 12 Jan 2015:  Additional information was provided by the neurologist via a Biogen Idec Employee.  The 
patient is currently hospitalized and not in contact with the environment.  No history of immunosuppressants use 
was reported.  The patient tested anti?JCV antibodies positive on 25 May 2012 (index not available) and has not 
been retested since.  MRI that led to PML suspicion was performed on 24 Dec 2014. The MRI report has been 
provided and is currently under translation (results previously reported).  Previous MRI was performed 2 years ago. 
The patient received a first session of PLEX on 08 Jan 2015, following which she presented a septic episode 
(reported as septic shock, onset 08 Jan 2015) for which she was hospitalized for (hospitalization dates not 
provided). No further PLEX sessions were provided.
Update 12 Jan 2015:  Additional information was provided by the neurologist. Report of brain MRI performed on 24 
Dec 2014 was provided.  Results showed extensive demyelinating lesions bilaterally and subtentorially in the 
cerebral hemispheres.  There was presence of extensive occipital and temporal-occipital lesions on the left (sub-
cortical).  No foci of abnormal intensity observed after the intravenous administration of the paramagnetic 
substance.  No compression phenomena observed.  There were cerebral and cerebellar atrophy findings.  The 
temporal-occipital and parietal-temporal lesion on the left is possibly indicative of PML.  Comparison with previous 
imaging test was recommended but previous tests of the patient were not available.
Update 15 Jan 2015:  Upon internal review, this case has been confirmed for PML based on positive CSF, 
consistent radiological evidence, and clinical symptoms.
Update 16 Jan 2015:  Additional information was provided by the neurologist. Reports of the baseline MRIs (brain 
and cervical spine) performed on 26 Jul 2012 were provided.  Brain MRI on 26 Jul 2012 was performed with 4mm-
thick sections in T1 and T2 pulse sequences at three levels, before and after the administration of a contrast.
There were multiple confluent punctuate foci of high signal intensity in the central white matter bilaterally, 
paraventricular and supraventricular region, without contrast enhancement on demyelinating plaques in chronic 
phase, in particular in the central white matter at the subependymal region.  Some of them were observed in the 
basal ganglia and some subcortically, bilaterally, on the parietal, occipital and frontal-parietal region, without 
contrast enhancement on demyelinating plaques in chronic phase.  Similar types of changes were also seen in the 
cerebellum, in particular in the right cerebellum, also without contrast enhancement.  The internal and external 
subarachnoid region was symmetric ? proportionate to the age.  After the intravenous contrast infusion, no clearly 
intraparenchymal contrast intake observed.  Cervical vertebral column MRI on 26 Jul 2012 was performed with 
4mm-thick sections in T1 and T2 pulse sequences. The test was carried out from the height of the craniocervical 
junction up to the thorax upper part, before and after contrast administration.  The investigation of the cervical 
marrow showed few punctuate foci of high signal intensity in the T2 sequence, possibly on demyelinating plaques in

chronic phase due to the non-contrast enhancement.  Similar types of changes were also seen in the imaged 
thoracic part of the cervical marrow.  Also, a disc hernia was seen at C6-C7 level causing moderate degree 
compression phenomena on the meningeal sac and compression phenomena on the cervical marrow.  When 
compared with the previous cervical vertebral column examination, no significant change was observed.
Update 06 Feb 2015: Additional information was received from the neurologist via a MS PML Data Collection Form:
Suspect.  The patient on TYSABRI was being evaluated for PML due to clinical signs and symptoms which 
prompted MRI which revealed suspicious findings.  The patient is currently in the hospital. The patient was 
diagnosed with MS on 01 Jan 1982.  The patient has never received prior immunosuppressant therapy; however, 
immunomodulatory therapy included Avonex IM for MS from 01 Jan 2007 to 01 Jan 2010.  Signs and symptoms 
which led to the evaluation for possible PML included short-term memory disorders (cognitive/behavioral), aphasic 
disorders (speech) (onsets 22 Dec 2014), and visual agnosia (visual) (onset unknown).  A MRI at the time of 
suspected PML diagnosis was performed on 24 Dec 2014 and a MRI prior to suspected PML diagnosis was 
performed on 26 Jul 2012 (results previously reported).  A lumbar puncture was performed on 29 Dec 2014 and 
CSF sample was tested on 29 Dec 2014 at a local lab; CSF JCV DNA results were positive (187 copies/ml) 
(previously reported with discrepant date). The patient tested positive for serum anti-JCV antibody on 22 May 2012 
(date discrepant; index value not provided).  Treatment for PML included 1 session of PLEX on 26 Dec 2015 
(presume 2014) and corticosteroids (NOS) 1mg IV 1x1 for 5 days from 22 Dec 2014 to 26 Dec 2015 (presume 
2014).  The event of PML suspicion is ongoing. PML suspicion had not been ruled out. The causality of the event 
PML suspicion in relation to TYSABRI was assessed as related.   TYSABRI therapy was interrupted as of 22 Dec 
Update 30 Mar 2015:  Additional information was received from the neurologist.  The patient has been lost to follow-
up as the patient moved one month after being diagnosed with PML.  No further information was provided.
