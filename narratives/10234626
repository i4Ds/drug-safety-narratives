Medically Significant
A neurologist spontaneously reported that a  58 year old female patient on TYSABRI (unknown dose, unknown 
route, unknown frequency) for Multiple Sclerosis from unknown date to unknown date experienced PML high 
suspicion (based on MRI, asymptomatic) (onset unknown). The physician was convinced this patient, although 
asymptomatic, has developed PML, based on MRI. Serum anti-JCV antibodies were tested positive. Lumbar 
puncture will be done this week and CSF sample will be sent to (b) (6)  The outcome for the event PML high 
suspicion (based on MRI, asymptomatic) is unknown. The causality for the event of PML high suspicion (based on 
MRI, asymptomatic) was assessed as possibly related.  TYSABRI therapy was stopped temporarily. 
Update 30 May 2014: Additional information was received. The patient was on TYSABRI (unknown dose, unknown 
route, Q4W) from 03 May 2010 to 27 Jan 2014. Her past medication included interferon beta 1b. The patient was 
asymptomatic and the disease (presumed referred to MS) was very stable since the start of TYSABRI. The MS

symptoms always related to sensitive dysfuction of face and legs. MEPs (motor evoke potentials) showed light 
central disturbances however without functional consequences.
In Jan 2014, the patient stopped TYSABRI and wished to switch to an oral treatment. MRI from 26 Dec 2013 prior 
to PML suspicion showed a new lesion.  Her brain MRI on 26 Dec 2013 showed multiple white matter lesions 
bilaterally; number, distribution and morphology compatible with MS. There were no gadolinium enhancing lesions. 
There were several black holes, primarily supraventricular. Presence of a new, FLAIR MRI, hyperintense lesion was
located in the left occipital cortico buscortical region. No diffusion restrictive lesions suspicious for PML. The lesion 
recovered after the patient was treated with corticosteroids at the beginning of Feb 2014.Brain MRI on 06 Feb 2014
showed multiple demyelinating lesions supratenrotieel well as infratentorial. Multiple lesions exhibited a black hole 
aspect. There were no new, active or gadolinium enhancing lesions nor diffusion restrictive lesions. However, 
further follow up on MRI was worrisome according to the neurologist. Brain MRI on 26 May 2014 along with the one
on 28 Apr 2014 showed multiple scattered white matter lesions periventricular, supraventricular and cortico-
subcortical with number and morphology compatible with known MS. Also, there were some lesions in the corpus 
callosum and multiple T2 hyper intense lesions in the left occipital with `overflowing? aspect, further increased in 
comparison with previous MRI of 28 Apr 2014 with sparing of the overlying cortex and peripheral nodular contrast 
capture. There were new, smaller, highly similar injury left occipital diffusion restriction. These looked like active MS
lesions. The patient was tested positive for anti JCV antibodies from the beginning and retested positive from 
(b) (6)  on 28 Apr 2014. The patient's EDSS was 2.0 prior to TYSABRI on 15 Oct 2007, 2.0 while on TYSABRI on 
26 Dec 2013 and 2.0 on 26 May 2014 at the time of PML suspicion. The patient's CSF analysis on 12 May 2014 
was normal. There was no intrathecal IgG synthesis. Her IgG synthesis rate and IgG in CSF were normal. The 
result of lumbar puncture from (b) (6)  on 28 May 2014 was pending at the time of this report. Treatment included 
mefloquine and mirtazapine. No further information was provided.
Update 03 Jun 2014: The result of lumbar puncture from(b) (6)  on 28 May 2014 was negative.
Update 11 Jun 2014: The result of [lumbar puncture] from (b) (6)  was negative. 
Update 16 Jun 2014: A MRI was scheduled for 24 Jun 2014. At the time of this report, the patient's clinical signs 
had been stable.
Update 26 Jun 2014: Upon internal review, this case is considered to be low suspect for PML due to negative CSF 
and MRI consistent with MS.
Update 04 Jul 2014: Additional information was received via a Biogen Idec employee (Medical Liaison Manager) 
that a MRI done a week earlier at the time of this week show that the original PML suspect lesion was smaller. 
There were new lesions which according to the radiologist, were MS lesions. The patient was symptomatic at the

time of this report, but due to MS activity according to neurologist, not IRIS. A new MRI was planned at the end of 
Jul 2014. The neurologist could not exclude PML, but given the fact that the patient stopped TYSABRI in Jan 2014, 
the original lesion was smaller now and because the patient is an older lady, a new LP was not planned.
