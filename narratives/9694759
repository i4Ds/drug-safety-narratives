An adult female patient on TYSABRI (300 mg, IV, QM) for Multiple Sclerosis since 27 Feb 2007 and enrolled in a 
Biogen Idec sponsored marketing program of Monitored Therapy reported experiencing spinal tap (NOS) (onset 
unknown) and  pain in right leg (onset 30 Oct 2013). Treatment is unknown and the outcome for the events pain in 
right leg and spinal tap (NOS) is unknown.  Causality was not assessed. TYSABRI therapy continues.
Update 25 Feb 2014: A neurologist spontaneously reported that a patient on TYSABRI from 27 Feb 2007 to 22 Nov
2013 experienced possible PML (onset Nov 2013) and right lower extremity weakness (onset Oct 2013).  At the 
time of this report the TOUCH database indicated the patient received a total of 82 doses of TYSABRI from 27 Feb 
2007 to 22 Nov 2013.  Prior MS therapies included Copaxone (glatiramer acetate), Betaseron (interferon beta-1b), 
Avonex (interferon beta-1a) and Rebif (interferon beta-1a).  It was unknown if the patient had taken prior 
immunosuppressant therapy.  The patient tested positive for JCV antibodies in Jun 2013.  CSF as of 22 Nov 2013 
was negative for JCV.  MRI of the brain in Sept 2013 and Oct 2013 were unchanged from priors (NOS).  The 
patient received rituximab in Jan (presumed 2014).  The outcome for the events of possible PML and right lower 
extremity weakness were unknown.  Causality was unknown.  The action taken with TYSABRI therapy was 
unknown.
Update 26 Feb 2014: Follow-up received from the neurologist provided the following information.  The patient had 
no prior immunosuppression, but noted that rituximab was dosed two months after the last TYSABRI dose.
Possible alternate diagnosis being considered (besides PML) is MS.  JCV antibody index was 1.19 and the 
neurologist would provide the JCV assay details.  The patient was hospitalized at the time of this report.
Update 27 Feb 2014: The neurologist reported the patient received methylprednisolone IV from 25 Oct to 28 Oct 
2013, ACTH (adrenocorticotropic hormone) from 12 Dec to 17 Dec 2013 and rituximab from 15 Jan to 28 Jan 2014.
 Recent MRI of the brain was performed on (b) (6)  and showed interval appearance of the an ill-defined the 
confluent area of FLAIR hyperintensity involving the subcortical white matter in the medial posterior left frontal lobe, 
adjacent to the falx cerebri, involving the precentral gyrus region likely involving the lower extremity motor area. 
This region shows ill-defined enhancement in the white matter also with mild expansion of the overlying gyrus with 
likely mild adjacent the leptomeningeal enhancement also. A tiny new focus of enhancement is also noted in the left
centrum semiovale white matter.
Update 27 Feb 2014: The neurologist provided the results of the JCV DNA PCR test on CSF sample collected 04 
Nov 2013.  The result was negative from (b) (6)

Update 05 Mar 2014: Results of JCV DNA PCR test on CSF collected on(b) (6)  were positive at 18 
copies/ml from (b) (6)
Update 06 Mar 2014: Upon internal review, Biogen Idec considers this case to be confirmed for PML based on the 
clinical symptoms, positive CSF, and MRI findings.
Update 23 Apr 2014: A consumer spontaneously reported that the patient was hospitalized from an unknown date 
to an unknown date for can not move (onset unknown), seizure (onset unknown) and PML (previously reported).
The patient was not able to move her right side and arms and legs and was diagnosed with PML in (b) (6)   No 
further information was provided.
Update 12 Jun 2014: In response to a request for follow-up information, the neurologist reported that the patient is 
in hospice and that no MRIs have been scheduled; no further information was reported.
Update 08 Sep 2014: A report was received via a literature: P857 Zhovtis Ryerson, I Kister, and J Herbert
(September 2014). Maraviroc and JC - virus associated immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome. Multiple 
Sclerosis Journal 2014; 20: (S1) 285?496. Retrieved from msj.sagepub.com.The authors reported 2 cases of 
Maraviroc-treated disseminated PML-NTZ which no clinically or radiologically significant IRIS was observed over 3-
15 months of follow up. The second patient refers to this case who is 47 year old woman with RRMS on NZB for 6 
years and 9 months who developed progressive right lower extremity weakness. Brain MRI revealed a new T2 
lesion in the left motor cortex and spinal fluid analysis confirmed the diagnosis, with 18 JCV copies/mL detected 
((b) (6)  laboratory). Maraviroc was initiated after PLEX. No significant radiological or clinical IRIS has yet to be seen.
