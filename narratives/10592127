A treating neurologist spontaneously reported that a male patient on TYSABRI (300 mg, IV, QM) for Multiple 
Sclerosis for several years from unknown date to unknown date experienced suspect PML characterized by MRI 
worsening (onset 03 Nov 2014) on a routine follow up MRI.  MRI images will be sent to a university hospital for a 
second reading. A lumbar puncture was performed on 05 Nov 2014 to test JCV DNA; sample will be sent to 
(b) (6)   No treatment was reported for the event. At the time of this report, the patient showed no new
clinical signs.  The outcome for the event is unknown. The causality for the event was assessed as possibly related.
 It is unknown if TYSABRI treatment is ongoing.
Update 09 Nov 2014:  Additional information was provided a Biogen Idec Employee (medical science liaison).
According to guidelines of the Belgian Studygroup for MS, the patient was undergoing routine MRI monitoring every
4 months due to being on TYSABRI for over 3 years and being JCV antibody positive.

Update 13 Nov 2014: Additional information was received from the treating neurologist.  CSF JCV results from 
(b) (6)  were still pending; however, results of PCR test from a local lab were "slightly positive".  The 49 year old 
male patient started plasmaferesis this week after consultation with a MS expert. 
Update 14 Nov 2014: Additional information was received from the treating neurologist. Results of PCR test from a 
local, less sensitive lab were positive (number of copies was not provided); results from (b) (6)  are still pending. The
patient had already been plexed 4 times; a 5th session was planned today. No additional information was provided. 
Update 19 Nov 2014: Follow-up information was received from the hospital laboratory.  CSF sample had been sent 
to a local lab a results were mild positive, <2.7 log copies/ml.  The patient was currently stable, there was a ring 
enhancement on the first MRI which was now disappeared.  Patient still asymptomatic and physician is keeping 
watch for signs of IRIS.
Update 19 Nov 2014: Follow-up information received indicated the MS expert's opinion on the case was that on one
hand, he was glad the enhancement disappeared, but given the "mild positive" result from the local lab [CSF JCV 
DNA] he is still very vigilant for PML. 
Update 20 Nov 2014: Follow-up information received indicated that CSF sample tested positive at 245 copies/ml 
from (b) (6)  lab.
Update 01 Dec 2014: Follow-up information received from the physician indicated the patient is still stable and
asymptomatic.  MRI last week showed no evolution and the next MRI planned for next week.
Update 23 Dec 2014: Follow-up information was received from the neurologist via a suspect PML Data Collection 
Form.  MS was diagnosed on 01 Oct 2007.  The suspect product was confirmed as TYSABRI (300 mg, IV, QM) 
which was started on 01 Sep 2009 and stopped on 05 Nov 2014.  There was no interruption of the suspect product 
for greater than three months.  The patient had not received any prior immunosuppressant therapy.  Previous 
immunomodulatory therapy included betaseron (interferon beta-1b).  The patient was evaluated for PML due to 
routine MRI which revealed suspicious findings.  The patient was asymptomatic.  The routine MRI was performed 
according to reimbursement criteria every 4 months after 2 years on natalizumab in JCV positive patients.  MRI 
prior to suspected PML diagnosis was performed on 07 Jul 2014.  MRI at the time of suspected PML diagnosis was
performed on(b) (6)   Lumbar puncture was performed on (b) (6) .  CSF JCV DNA result at local lab 
was positive (<500 copies/ml) and at (b) (6)  laboratories was positive (245 copies/ml).  Anti-JCV antibody status 
was positive on 27 Mar 2014 (index 3.306) and (b) (6)  (index 3.172).  Brain biopsy has not been performed.
CSF analysis on (b) (6)  was normal.  The patient is currently hospitalized.  The patient underwent five 
sessions of plasma exchange (PLEX) on (b) (6) (b) (6) (b) (6) (b) (6)  and (b) (6) .

 The patient did not undergo immunoadsorption.  PML treatment included corticosteroids (NOS; 1g, IV) for 10 days 
from 05 Dec 2014 to 14 Dec 2014, methylprednisolone (64mg, PO) from 14 Dec 2014 to 17 Dec 2014 and 
methylprednisolone (48mg, PO) from 18 Dec 2014 to 21 Dec 2014.  Additional information received reported that 
after PLEX, MRI lesion was smaller.  The patient came to the clinic for a planned visit on 05 Dec 2014 with clinical 
symptoms and IV corticoids were started.  On(b) (6)  the patient was hospitalized.  One week later, MRI was 
stable.  The patient was continued with oral corticoids ((b) (6) ) which were lowered in dose.
The patient is currently still hospitalized and the physician will increase the dose of oral corticosteroids again.
Update 24 Dec 2014: Follow-up information received included MRI images from 11 Dec 2014, (b) (6)  18 
(b) (6) (b) (6) (b) (6) (b) (6)  03 Mar 2014, 07 Jul 2014, and 29 Jun 2009.  No further 
information was provided.
Update 02 Jan 2015: Biogen Idec considers this case to be confirmed for PML based on positive CSF and MRI 
findings.
Update 06 Jan 2015: Follow-up information was received from a nurse. The patient had an epileptic seizure, 
currently has hemiplegia, and aphasia.  The patient is currently in the hospital.  No further information was

weeks ago, and status of patient currently is unchanged. Next MRI is planned next week.
Update 20 Jan 2015: Follow-up information was received from the physician.  The clinical symptoms were 
unchanged, on MRI there was a slight worsening. Currently no change in management. The patient remains 
hospitalized.
Update 20 Mar 2015: Follow-up information was received from the physician. The patient status was unchanged, 
still hospitalized, clinically not worse, not better and still treated with corticosteroids. An additional MRI image was 
received dated 20 Feb [2015].
Update 30 Mar 2015: Follow-up information received from the neurologist indicated that another MRI was done on 
26 Mar 2015 and there was an improvement. The patient is also doing slightly better.
Update 30 Mar 2015: Follow-up information included MRI images for MRIs performed on 30 Jan 2015 and 20 Feb

Update 31 Mar 2015: Follow-up information received from the neurologist's office reported that they will send a new
CSF sample for JCV DNA PCR testing at (b) (6)  tomorrow.  The patient was slightly improving and physician 
wanted to see viral load. 
Update 01 Apr 2015: Follow-up information included MRI images for MRI performed on 26 Mar 2015.
Update 14 Apr 2015: Follow-up information received from the physician reported that the (b) (6)  PCR was 
negative for JCV DNA. The patient is very slowly recovering, still on oral steroids with the dose being lowered very 
slowly.
Update 26 May 2015: Additional information was received from neurologist via a MS Standardized PML Data 
Collection Tool. The patient is alive, currently in the hospital, and not on therapy for Multiple Sclerosis.  The 
neurologist reported the patient is doing slightly better, still hospitalized but he is planning to send patient home. 
The patient's estimated EDSS scores: (b) (6)  was 5.0; (b) (6)  was 8.0; and Mar 2015 was 6.0.  Test results 
on 19 May 2015 post-PML included leukocyte count 8700; lymphocyte count 33 %; and absolute lymphocyte count 
2.88 (units and reference ranges not provided). The neurologist assessed the patient?s estimated Karnofsky and 
EDSS scores on 26 May 2015 to be 50 (requires considerable assistance and frequent medical care) and 6. The 
most recent brain MRI was performed on 25 May 2015 and showed improvement).  The patient was diagnosed with
IRIS which was determined by clinical symptoms: motor, multifocal - hemiplegia right, speech - aphasia, and 
seizure: multifocal (onsets (b) (6) ). The patient did not receive corticosteroids pre-IRIS onset. Treatment for 
IRIS included corticosteroids (1 g, IV, once daily) from 12 Dec 2014 to 15 Jan 2015 and Medrol 
(methylprednisolone; 16 mg, PO, once daily) since 16 Jan 2015. PML status was assessed in Mar 2015 as 
recovered.  The outcome of the event of IRIS was assessed as not fully recovered. Causality for the events of PML 
and IRIS was assessed as related to TYSABRI.
