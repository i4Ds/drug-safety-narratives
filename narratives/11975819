This is a retrospective solicited report.
A clinical investigator reported that a baby had surgery for pyloric stenosis at 4 weeks of age (around 30-Sep-2008).
 The event pyloric stenosis was considered to be a congenital anomaly.  The baby was delivered on (b) (6)
(gestational age at delivery 36.9) and weighed 2639 grams at birth.  The baby s APGAR score was 8 at one minute 
and 9 at 5 minutes.  The babys mother received therapy with intravenous abatacept every month from 2006 to 30-
Dec-2007.
Investigator's causality assessment: Not provided
BMS causality assessment: The event pyloric stenosis was not likely related to abatacept therapy.
Cross reference number of the maternal file: 14931562-1
Supplemental information received from (b) (6)  on 18-Sep-2014 included the following:
Therapy with cholestyramine and leflunomide was added as an additional suspect.
The patient s mother was exposed to cholestyramine during pregnancy and leflunomide prior to pregnancy. There 
was no reason to think that abatacept was related to this defect (pyrolic stenosis). 
Investigator's causality assessment: The event pyloric stenosis was not related to abatacept therapy. Causality for 
cholestyramine and leflunomide therapies was not provided.
BMS causality assessment: The event pyloric stenosis was not likely related to abatacept, leflunomide and 
cholestyramine therapies.
Correction to file (13-Jan-2016): this case was reviewed and re-assessed by the Company due to retrospective 
review of pregnancy-related cases due to a health authority commitment. As result, based on information received 
on (12-Jan-2010), this case required the following changes:
The mother received abatacept, cholestyramine, leflunomide during pregnancy. She delivered a baby at 36.9 
gestational age. Hence premature baby and drug exposure in utero was added to be additional events. The event 
premature baby was considered to be medically significant.
The mother was on therapy with intravenous abatacept every month from 2006 to 30-Dec-2007.  The patient was
