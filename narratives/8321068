There was no change to the study drugs due to the events. In the investigators opinion, events pneumonia grade 
3, aeakePerlbkla 3, anemia grade 3, Ow. aa  -' 66:Ctia grade 3, mucositis grade 2, and peripheral sensory 
neuropathy grade 2 were r to the study drugs, and unrelated to protocol pre, es. Dyspnea grade 3, 
(right leg hyposthenia) grade 2, and mental confusion grade 2 were considered 
unrelated to study drugs or protocol procedures by the investigator. Per investigator explanation for pneumonia 
was that treatment could have favored sepsis and neutropenia; for neutropenia, anemia and thrombocytopenia was 
that treatment could have caused the haematologic toxicity; for mucositis was that the treatment most likely caused 
the mucositis, and for peripheral sensory neuropathy was that therapy could have caused neurotoxicity in
