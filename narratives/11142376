This spontaneous report was received from another manufacturer. A 10-month old female initiated intramuscular 
H.P. Acthar Gel (Acthar) dose and frequency not reported in May-2013 for infantile spasms. Concurrent medical 
conditions included Down's syndrome, hypothyroid, esophageal reflux, viral enteritis and a milk and soy allergy. The
patient was born premature at 35-36 weeks gestation with neonatal jaundice and hypotonia. Concomitant 
medications included vigabatrin, esomeprazole magnesium and levothyroxine sodium.
Acthar therapy was initiated in May-2013.  Since starting therapy, the patient had high blood pressure and in Jun-
2013, amlodipine for high blood pressure (details not provided) was started.  On 15-Aug-2013, the patient's mother 
noted the patient having eyes "going crazy" which happened five to 10 times throughout the day. On 16-Aug-2014, 
she was seen by the physician for recurrence of minor spasms since being weaned off Acthar and at that time, the 
mother reported that other than the "eyes episodes" the patient had not had one of these episodes or any other 
seizure activity since Jun-2013.  A new prescription for Acthar was written during this visit. On 27-Nov-2013, the 
patient was seen during follow-up with the physician and it was noted that the patient had no seizures in the 
previous three months and no episodes since 16-Aug-2013. Acthar was discontinued on this visit. Assessment note
from this visit stated that her remission was mainly induced ACTH course in May-2013. Outcome of the high blood 
pressure was unknown.
