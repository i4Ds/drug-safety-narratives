On 11 Jul 2012, she presented with left upper limb hypostenia and decrease in cognitive function. Her symptoms 
continued to persist between Aug 2012 and Sep 2012. An MRI from 06 Aug 2012, compared to prior MRI from 18 
Feb 2012, showed a demyelinating foci on the right precentral gyrus near the vertex, the lesion was hyperintense 
on T2 weighted sequences and mildly enhancing. A lumbar puncture performed on 07 Aug 2012 was tested at a 
local lab and returned negative for JCV DNA. A repeat MRI on 22 Sep 2012 showed substantial changes in the size
and characteristics signal of already known demyelinating lesions of bilateral callosomarginal junction, 
periventricular, corpus callosum, frontal subcortical bilateral, and bilateral thalamus white matter. Some lesions 
appeared hypointense due to chronic loss of myelin. Other demyelinating lesions of the right precentral gyrus 
results unchanged. No pathologic enhancement was observed. 
The patient did not receive treatment with PLEX, but did receive IV steroids (nos) from 08 Oct 2012 to 12 Oct 2012,
followed by an oral steroid (nos) taper beginning 13 Oct 2012. A repeat lumbar puncture was performed on 30 Oct 
2012 and tested at (b) (6)  laboratory and again returned negative for JCV DNA. The patient continued to clinically 
decline into Nov 2012 with an EDSS of 8, and assumed IRIS. She had left hemiplegia with partial recovery of 
speech and lower limb movement, while her upper limb remained impaired. An MRI from 14 Nov 2012 showed 
presence of a large area of signal alteration with enhancement. IRIS was suspected secondary to encephalitis of 
unknown origin. At this time, there were no plans to re-tap the patient. Repeat MRI was done on 28 Nov 2012 and 
showed multiple hyperintense foci of altered signal on T2 and FLAIR sequences bilaterally in the periventricular, 
pericallosal, and supraventricular white matter.  Similar finding arouse in in the corpus callosum, which appeared 
severely thinned.  Small foci with similar characteristics were observed in the cerebellum and in the pontine-
mesencephalic junction.  None of the lesions showed significant enhancement.
As of Dec 2012, the patient was stable without worsening for approximately 3 weeks. At that time, the MD stated 
PML remained excluded as a diagnosis. On 15 Jan 2013, the treating physician stated all tests to diagnose the 
encephalitis were negative, the patient was in a rehab facility and had almost completely recovered left lower limb 
function, but during the last week had showed a slight worsening of the left upper limb that results still plegic. She 
was treated with Solu-Medrol for five days followed by a 6 day deltacortene taper and cognitively was assessed as 
intact. A partial improvement was seen.  The patient is slowly recovering and can walk with aid, an EDSS (date of 
evaluation unknown) was 6.5. Repeat MRIs from 15 Jan 2013 and 23 Jan 2013 were essentially unchanged 
compared to prior scan from 28 Nov 2012.
As of 19 Feb 2013, the patient showed a clearly evident left upper limb hemiparesis, left upper limb almost 
anesthetized (the patient did not recognize her own limb), facial hypoesthesia and severe right arm intentional 
tremor. Her sense of judgment worsened, she was not able to perform her daily activities such as taking care of her
5 year old son and her EDSS was assessed as 6.5.

On 28 Mar 2013, the neurologist shared with Biogen that he had sent an aliquot of CSF from the 30 Oct 2012 
lumbar puncture to (b) (6)  for testing and it returned positive at 37 copies/mL. At the time of this report, the 
physician stated the patient has almost completely recovered function of the left lower limb; the left upper limb 
showed a slight worsening but remains pelagic.  The patient's cognitive condition remains unchanged (good).  An 
MRI was also performed "last week" (presumed Mar 2013), but no results were reported. Biogen Idec considered 
this case confirmed for PML based on clinical symptoms, positive MRI findings, and positive CSF results on 02 Apr 
Update 07 May 2013: Additional information was received from the physician via a MS Standardized PML Data 
Collection Tool.  On 22 Apr 1996 (discrepant from previous report), the patient was diagnosed with MS. MS 
symptoms included (cognitive/behavioral) reduced memory (onset 2005) and (motor) left hyposthenia, mild left 
dysmetria, right hypoparesthesia (onset 2005). Prior immunosuppressant therapy included azathioprine 50 mg per 
os BID (27 Jun 1996 to 12 Apr 2000 and from 24 Oct 2005 to 20 Oct 2008) and prior immunomodulatory therapy 
included Rebif 44 mcg 3 times per week (14 May 2004 to 23 Oct 2008) (dates discrepant from previous report). On 
20 Apr 2009 the patient had a complete blood count (CBC) done (results not provided). It was re-reported that the 
patient was on TYSABRI therapy from 28 Apr 2009 to 13 Jul 2012 (discrepant from previous reports). The 
physician assessed the patient's estimated Karnofsky and EDSS scores as follows: (prior to TYSABRI) on an 
unknown date the estimated Karnofsky score to be 80 (normal activity with effort; some signs or symptoms of 
disease) and the EDSS on 07 Nov 2008 to be 5.5. On 16 Feb 2012 the patient tested positive for anti-natalizumab 
antibodies. (On TYSABRI prior to PML) the physician assessed the patient's estimated Karnofsky on an unknown 
date to be 80 and the EDSS on 24 Feb 2012 to be 4.5. On 11 Apr 2012 the patient had a positive urine test for JCV 
DNA. On 05 Sep 2012, the patient had a negative blood and urine test for JCV DNA and a negative HIV test. The 
physician assessed the patient's estimated Karnofsky score (at the time of PML diagnosis) on an unknown date to 
be 50 (requires considerable assistance and frequent medical care). On 06 Aug 2012 the patient underwent a 
lumbar puncture with results reported as negative CSF JCV DNA. On 29 Oct 2012 (date discrepant from previous 
report) the patient underwent a lumbar puncture with results reported as negative CSF JCV DNA (b) (6)  and 
positive CSF JCV DNA at 37 micro/mL ((b) (6) ). A brain biopsy has not been performed. The physician assessed the 
patient's estimated EDSS on 18 Apr 2013 to be 6.0. The patient is residing at home and she has not recovered 
from PML. Causality for the event of PML was assessed as related to TYSABRI.
Update 13 May 2013: Additional information was received from the physician via a MS Standardized PML Data 
Collection Tool. On 25 Mar 2009 the patient had a CBC done (result not reported). PML treatment included 
corticosteroids I gr EV daily (08 Oct 2012 to 22 Oct 2012, 13 Jan 2013 to 18 Jan 2013, and 14 Mar 2013 to 21 Mar 
2013). On 15 Jan 2013, 25 Jan 2013 and 22 Mar 2013 the patient had an MRI done (results not reported).
Update 28 May 2013:  The neurologist provided the following additional information and medical records.  The

onset for PML was reported as 16 Jun 2012 (date discrepant).  The patient was on TYSABRI from 23 Sep 2009 to 
13 Jul 2012 (dates discrepant).  A brain MRI from 22 Mar 2013 (compared to MRI from 23 Jan 2013) showed 
reduced focus of altered hyperintense signal on T2 subcortical white matter and tumefaction at the pre and post 
rolandic convesity on the right.   A trend in reduction was noted for the smaller focus of altered signal and for the 
faded oedemogenic peri-focal halo in the subcortical area, left rolandic region.  The already known foci of T2 
hyperintensitive, partially confluent into the paraventricular white matter, into the semioval centers with bilateral 
involvement of the corpus callosum and para-callosum, was essentially unchanged.  There was partial involvement 
of the periaqueductal white matter of the basal ganglia, bilaterally, of the right temporo-insular region of the 
cerebellar peduncles.  The corpus callosum is thinned.  Gadolinium enhancement was seen in the right pre-rolandic
region, with no further foci of pathologic enhancement in the brain.  All other findings were essentially unchanged.
A cervical MRI from 22 May 2013 was unchanged compared to cervical MRI from 12 Sep 2102.  A complete blood 
count, AST, ALT, and GGT from 20 Apr 2009 (prior to TYSABRI treatment) were normal.  A complete metabolic 
panel from an unknown date were normal except for an ALT of 69 U/L (reference range 5 to 40) and IgM of 3.06 
g/L (reference range 0.4 to 2.3).
Update 15 Oct 2013: Additional information was received from a physician via a MS Standardized PML Data 
Collection Tool. The patient is alive, residing at home, and is currently on Copaxone (started 9 May 2013) for MS 
therapy. Currently, the patient has an upper limb plegia and a lower limb paresis along with correspondent sensitive
deficits. So far, no significant and beneficial strength recovery of the left upper limb was observed. The clinical 
picture resulted stable. A physiotherapy cycle was scheduled in order to improve the other remaining functions. 
Memory, attention and concentration deficit, and urgency of mict (micturition) were observed. She felt severely 
fatigued even after mild labors. The latter impairments have made her life uncomfortable and painful. She needed a
caregiver s support in order to perform daily activities, especially cooking. The physician assessed the patient s 
estimated Karnofsky and EDSS scores on 15 Oct 2013 to be 60 (requires occasional assistance, but is able to care
for most of her personal needs) and 5.5. No additional lumbar punctures or MRIs have been done. The patient has 
recovered from PML (noted partial recovery of the left hemiparesis, more accentuated in the lower limb, almost 
imperceptible in the upper limb, and good recovery of the cognitive deficit) and IRIS. Causality for the event of PML 
was assessed as related to TYSABRI. Causality for the event of IRIS to TYSABRI was not assessed.
Update 23 Oct 2013:  A physician reported via the National Pharmacovigilance Network (registry number not 
provided) that the patient, on TYSABRl from 23 Sep 2009 to 13 Jul 2012 (dates discrepant) experienced PML 
(onset 16 Jun 2012; date discrepant).  The event was assessed as possibly related to TYSABRl, and evaluation 
was performed through the Naranjo algorithm.  In addition, the reaction has been classified as expected.
Update 14 Apr 2014: Additional information was received from a physician via a MS Standardized PML Data 
Collection Tool. The patient is alive, residing at home, and is currently on Copaxone (started 9 May 2013) for MS

therapy. The patients fatigue and the depressive syndrome were accentuated despite the fact that she was on 
Zoloft (sertraline) 50, 1 tablet. The patient started Xanax (alprazolam) 10 drops three times daily on 02 Apr 2014. 
She was also on Keppra (levetiracetam) therapy, 500 mg in the morning and 1000 mg in the evening due to the left 
upper limb proximal clonic state with improvement. The physician assessed the patients estimated Karnofsky and 
EDSS scores on 03 Apr 2014 to be 60 (requires occasional assistance, but is able to care for most of her personal 
needs) and 5.5. The most recent brain MRI was performed on 22 Mar 2013 (previously reported). No additional 
lumbar punctures have been performed. The patient has recovered from PML and IRIS. Causality for the events 
was assessed as related to TYSABRI.
Update 24 Sep 2014:  A report was received from literature.  Gajofatto A, Bianchi M R, Deotto L, and Benedetti M 
D.  Are natalizumab and fingolimod analogous second-line options for the treatment of relapsing-remitting multiple 
sclerosis?  A clinical practice observational study.  European Neurology.  06 Sep 2014;  173-180.  The 46 year old 
female subject with suspected PML refers to this case.  The subject was treated with natalizumab for 36 months at 
the time of neurological deterioration and had previously received 3 years of treatment with azathioprine.  The 
subject tested positive for serum anti-JCV antibodies in Apr 2012, at month 28 of natalizumab therapy.
Natalizumab was discontinued for suspected PML.  PML was confirmed after repeated high sensitivity JCV PCR 
DNA assay in the CSF.  After [natalizumab] treatment interruption, the subject continued to worsen and presented 
with clinical features or immunological reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS).  IRIS resolved "in a few weeks"
with severe neurological sequelae.
Update 10 Jun 2015:  Additional information was received from a physician via a MS Standardized PML Data 
Collection Tool. The patient is alive, residing at home, and continues on Copaxone (started 9 May 2013) for MS 
therapy. The physician assessed the patient s estimated Karnofsky and EDSS scores on 01 Apr 2015 to be 60 
(requires occasional assistance, but is able to care for most of her personal needs) and 5.5. The most recent brain 
MRI was performed on 05 Jun 2014 (compared to MRI from 22 Mar 2013; previously reported) and showed no 
differences in variation, number, or characteristics of known demyelinating lesions.  Some lesions showed 
hyperintensity on T1 as myelinic chronic loss; after gadolinium injection none showed enhancement.  There were 
no differences in the dimension of the ventricular system, no differences on diameter in antero-posteriori of left 
ocular globe, and no differences in remaining findings.  A cervical column MRI (compared to MRI from 22 Mar 
2013) showed no important variation of already known demyelinating intramedullary focus in posterior ribbon in 
paramedium left site at C2-C3 passage.  A little less evident than previous, same focus T2 hyperintense 
intramedullary at passage D1-D2.  After gadolinium injection, no pathologic areas enhanced.  At C4-C5, C5-C6, 
and C6-C7 disc protrusion at wide-ranging.  No differences in remaining findings.  The patient has recovered from 
PML and IRIS.  Causality for the events was not assessed.
