Medically Significant
A 54 year old female patient on TYSABRI (300 mg, IV, QM) for Multiple Sclerosis from 18 Feb 2013 to 03 Feb 2014
and enrolled in a Biogen Idec sponsored marketing program of Monitored Therapy reported being hospitalized from
(b) (6)  to an unknown date for possible PML (onset (b) (6) ) and may have iris (immune reconstitution 
inflammatory syndrome) (onset 03 Apr 2014).  At the time of this report, the TOUCH dosing database indicated that
the patient received a total of 8 doses of TYSABRI from 18 Feb 2013 to 03 Feb 2014.  The patient reported that her
physician has not diagnosed her with PML but is "not sure if that is what patient currently has".  The patient is JCV 
positive (presumed antibodies) (unknown date).  Testing included an MRI (unknown date) which showed "spots on 
brain".  Treatment included steroids (NOS), and the events are ongoing.  Additionally, the patient reported that she 
is getting TYSABRI every 8 weeks (onset unknown).  Causality for the events was not assessed by the patient.
TYSABRI therapy was discontinued 
Update 17 Apr 2014:  Upon follow-up from the medical assistant for the treating neurologist, including medical 
records, the medical assistant reported that the patient was diagnosed with PML .  Previous immunosuppresants 
included azathioprine, Cellcept (mycophenolate) from 2006 to 2011, and Gilenya (fingolimod) from 2011 to 2013, 
and previous immunomodulators included Avonex (interferon beta 1a) from 01 Jan 2000 to 01 Jan 2011.  The 
patient was on an atypical TYSABRI dosing regimen, and the last 4 infusions were 05 Jul 2013, 14 Oct 2013, 09 
Dec 2013, and 03 Feb 2014.  Concomitant medications included benztropine, cholecalciferol, dexamethasone, 
rituximab, azithromycin, Adderall (amphetamine-dextroamphetamine), Systane (polyethylene glycol), 
diphenhydramine, atenolol, lisinopril, solifenacin, venlafaxine, aspirin, omega-3, vitamin B-12, multivitamins, and 
naproxen.  Past medical history included calculus of kidney, diabetes antepartum, osteoarthritis, headache, 
phlebitis and thrombophlebitis of superficial veins of upper extremities, heart murmur, hemorrhoids, hypertension, 
urge incontinence, narrow angle glaucoma, visual field defect, conjunctivitis, optic neuritis, retinal disorder, 
depression, viral meningitis, and low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion.
Following the transition to Gilenya (fingolimod) in 2013, the patient was diagnosed with severe left sensorineal 
deafness on the left (onset Jan 2013).  Testing included a brain MRI and MRA of the head and neck which were 
stable and did not reveal any central cause of the deafness.  Treatment included corticosteroids (NOS) along with 6
weekly treatments of Enbrel (etanercept) in conjunction with TYSABRI every 8 weeks, and three rounds of PLEX 
therapy with steroids (NOS) in Jun, Aug, and Nov 2013.  The patient had remarkable hearing improvement with 
each round of PLEX, followed by rapidly re-administering TYSABRI to avoid IRIS.  In 2013, the patient was also 
diagnosed with herpetic meningitis (onset unknown).  Testing was not reported.  Treatment included anti-microbial 
agents (NOS) and the event resolved.
Recently, the patient started experiencing worsening symptoms including worsening of speech, unexplained falls,

and severe fatigue.  The patient was then admitted into the hospital "on (b) (6)  or (b) (6) ".  An MRI performed on 
(b) (6)  revealed new enhancing lesions in the right lateral cerebellum, right middle cerebeallar penduncle, 
with smaller lesions in the right para-vermal cerebellum (one with ring enhancement), additional punctate 
enhancing lesions in the body of the brainstem, mostly pons and midbrain, and a punctate enhancing lesions in the 
deep left frontal white matter.  Previous tests included a JCV test (presumed blood or serum) on 19 Mar 2009 that 
was negative with < 500 copies, and a JCV test on 12 Dec 2011 that was a positive.  A JCV CSF DNA test 
performed at the (b) (6)  on (b) (6)  that was positive, and a JCV CSF DNA (11 Apr 2014) from (b) (6)  was 
positive at 2180 copies/mL.  Treatment included PLEX (plasma exchange), followed by IVIG (intravenous 
immunoglobulin) for five days, followed by Solu-Medrol (methylprednisolone) for 12 weeks and then every other 
weekn for six weeks.  Additionally, the patient was recently diagnosed with the noro virus "about a month ago" 
(onset unknown) and presumptive sinusitis (onset (b) (6) ).  Symptoms of the noro virus included emesis and 
diarrhea, and symptoms of the presumptive sinusitis included chronic cough with right facial sinus pressure.  No 
treatment was reported for the noro virus.  Treatment included Z-Pack (azithromycin) for the presumptive sinusitis.
Causality for the events was not assessed.  TYSABRI therapy was discontinued on (b) (6)   No further 
information provided.
Update 24 Apr 2014:  Upon internal review, Biogen Idec considers this case to be a confirmed case of PML based 
on clinical symptoms, consistent detailed MRI findings, and positive JCV DNA.
Update 10 Jul 2014: Additional information was received from a physician via a MS Standardized PML Data 
Collection Tool and diagnostic reports. An MRI was performed on 21 Oct 2013 with results reported as new 
enhancing focus within the right cerebellar hemisphere compatible with a new demyelinating plaque; otherwise, no 
significant interval change in scattered punctate foci of T2/ FLAIR hyperintensity within the frontal lobes. The patient
tested positive for anti-JCV antibodies in (b) (6)  A CBC with differential collected on (b) (6)  indicated the 
following abnormal results: RBC 3.63 (normal range: 3.70-5.10 x 10(6)/uL); MCV 98.1 (normal range: 80.0-98.0 fL);
MCH 33.3 (27.0-33.0 pg); neutrophils 37.4 (42.0-76.0%); monocytes 13.7 (normal range: 2.0-10.0%). Currently, the
patient is alive and has not recovered from PML since she has some residual effect.  Causality for the event was 
assessed as related to TYSABRI.
Update 28 Oct 2014: Additional information was received from the neurologist via a MS Standardized PML Data 
Collection Tool and diagnostic report. The patient is alive, residing at home, and is not currently on any MS therapy.
The neurologist assessed the patient s Karnofsky score as 80 (normal activity with effort; some signs or symptoms
of disease) on an unspecified date. Relevant labs obtained 30 Jun 2014 included the following: WBC 5.7 (normal 
range 4.0-10.0 x 10(3)/uL); absolute lymphocyte count 2 x 10(3)/uL; lymphocytes 30.9% (normal range 19.3-
51.7%). Relevant labs obtained 31 Jul 2014 included the following: WBC 5.5; absolute lymphocyte count 2 x 
10(3)/uL; lymphocytes 36.6%. A brain MRI performed on 25 Oct 2014 revealed multiple foci in keeping with given

clinical diagnosis of MS, no abnormal enhancement. No significant change compared to prior study dated 26 Jul 
2014. The patient has not been diagnosed with IRIS. The patient has recovered from PML. Causality for the event 
was assessed as related to TYSABRI.
Update 28 Apr 2015: Additional information was received from a registered nurse via a Standardized MS PML Data
Collection Tool. The patient is alive, residing at home, and is not currently on another therapy for MS. The most 
recent brain MRI was performed on (b) (6)  with results reported as follows: bilateral demyelinating lesions 
involving the middle cerebellar peduncles, cerebellum and pons. No new or enhancing lesions identified. Few foci 
of abnormal T2/FLAIR hyperintensity most prominent in the left frontal white matter without interval change may 
represent prominent perivascular spaces, remote infarcts or additional supratentorial demyelinating lesions. The 
patient was hospitalized from (b) (6)  to (b) (6)  (off product). At the time of this report, the outcome of 
the event of PML and IRIS was unknown (PML was previously reported as recovered). Causality of the event of 
PML was assessed as related to TYSABRI.
Update 08 Jul 2015:  The neurologist clarified that the patient was on Enbrel twice weekly for 12 weeks, starting 12 
Feb 2013 for near complete deafness developed while on Gilenya.
