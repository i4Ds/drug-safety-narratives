AUGUST 2009, THE PATIENT STARTED INTRAVENOUS BENDAMUSTINE INFUSION 185 MG EVERY 4 WEEK
(CYCLE1). IN SEPTEMBER 2009, THE PATIENT RECEIVED CYCLE 2 OF RITUXIMAB AND BENDAMUSTINE 
(D1, 50% OF THE DOSE). FROM 12-14 OCTOBER 2009, THE PATIENT RECEIVED CYCLE 3 OF RITUXIMAB 
AND BENDAMUSTINE.  ON 11 NOVEMBER 2009, THE PATIENT RECEIVED CYCLE 4 OF RITUXIMAB AND

OR SIGNIFICANT DISABILITY/ INCAPACITY. ON (b) (6)  THE PATIENT WAS HOSPITALIZED. IT WAS 
REPORTED THAT THE PATIENT HAD ONE YEAR HISTORY OF PROGRESSIVE FORGETFULNESS AS TOLD

THE PATIENT ALSO HAD DISORIENTATION.  ON AN UNKNOWN DATE, THE PATIENT DEVELOPED BACK 
PAIN FOR WHICH HE WAS HOSPITALIZED.  ON ADMISSION, ROUTINE BLOOD TESTS SHOWED 
THROMBOCYTOPENIA AND LEUCOCYTOPENIA ON (b) (6)   CEREBRAL LYMPHOMA WAS 
SUSPECTED AND HE WAS TRANSFERRED TO ANOTHER HOSPITAL. ON (b) (6)
THROMBOCYTOPENIA WAS RESOLVED. ON (b) (6)  THE CSF WAS WITHDRAWN. QUANTITATIVE 
JC-VIRUS IN PCR WAS NEGATIVE WITH LESS THAN 500 COPIES /ML. ON THE SAME DAY, ECG SHOWED 
ACUTE CORONARY SYNDROME. CORONARY ANGIOGRAPHY REVEALED THREE-VESSEL CORONARY 
HEART DISEASE WITH STENOSIS REQUIRING NO INTERVENTION. ON (b) (6)  BONE MARROW 
BIOPSY SHOWED NO LYMPHOMA MANIFESTATION AND CYTOLOFY AND HISTOLOGY WERE REPORTED 
AS NEGATIVE. ON 01 JULY 2010 REPEAT CRANIAL MRI SHOWED DEGENERATIVE MICRO-ANGIOPATHIC 
LEUCOENCEPHALOPATHY BUT NO EVIDENCE OF TYPICAL LYMPHOMA INFILTRATES. ON 02 JULY 2010, 
LEUKOPENIA WAS RESOLVED. THE CSF FLUID WAS SENT FOR PCR ANALYSIS ON 07 JULY 2010. ON 09 
JULY 2010, THE CSF FLUID WAS POSITIVE FOR JC-VIRUS DNA IN PCR TEST. ON 12 JULY 2010, THE
