EXPERIENCED INCREASING COUGH WHICH LED TO X-RAY CONTROL. PNEUMONIA WAS DIAGNOSED. 
ON THE SAME DAY, HE HAD RECEIVED LAST DOSE OF BEVACIZUMAB, CARBOPLATIN AND PEMETREXED 
PRIOR TO TIM ADVERSE EVENT. THOUGH HE WAS CLINICALLY STABLE, BUT THE INFILTRATION 
WORSENED. ON 20 APRIL 2010. HE RECEIVED TREATMENT WITH ORAL CEFTRIAXONE AT 2 GRAM DAILY 
IN RESPONSE TO THE EVENT. ON .111111111.111111. THE EVENT OF PNEUMONIA BECAME SERIOUS AND HE 
WAS HOSPITALISED. ON THE SAME DAY, X-RAY OF THORAX WAS DONE WHICH REVEALED 
PNUMONIA. ON THE SAME DAY, HE STARTED TREATMENT WITH INTRAVENOUS 
PIPERACIWWTAZOBACTAM (TAZOBAC) 4.5 GRAM DAILY AND CEFTRIAXONE WAS STOPPED.
