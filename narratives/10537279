Medically Significant
A neurologist spontaneously reported via a Biogen Idec employee (Medical Science Liaison) that an approximately 
28 year old female patient on TYSABRI (300 mg, IV, QM) for Multiple Sclerosis from unknown date to 2014 was 
currently hospitalized since an unknown date for suspected PML (onset Oct 2014). The neurologist stated that the 
patient was being transferred from a regional hospital to a center on (b) (6)  The patient will be examined 
once being transferred to the center. At the time of this report, the patient had received 40 TYSABRI infusions with 
the last infusion being given in last week.  Treatment and lab testing for the event were not reported. The event of 
suspected PML is ongoing. The causality for the event of suspected PML is unknown.  TYSABRI therapy was 
discontinued.

Update 10 Oct 2014: On the same day of the initial report, additional information was provided by the neurologist 
via a Standard PML Data Collection form. The patient on TYSABRI from Jun 2011 to 02 Oct 2014 received her last 
dose of TYSABRI infusion on 02 Oct 2014. The patient had not experienced an interruption of TYSABRI infusion for
greater than 3 months. MS was diagnosed in Nov 2007 and the patient was first seen at the neurologist's office on 
10 Oct 2014 for evaluation and treatment of (possible) PML. The patient did not have prior immunosuppressant or 
immunomodulatory therapies. The patient was hospitalized currently. PML suspicion was based on the patient's 
clinical signs and symptoms which included mild cognitive/behavioral changes described as inappetence and 
disturbance of drive with the onset date of Sep 2014 noted by the patient's parents. The changes led to the 
consultation visit on 09 Oct 2014 and promoted MRI on 10 Oct 2014 which revealed suspicious findings. MRI prior 
to the suspicion of PML was performed on 13 Mar 2014. The results of MRIs were not reported. Lumbar puncture 
was performed on (b) (6)  and CSF samples were sent to a local lab and (b) (6)  respectively. The results of CSF
testing were pending at the time of this report. CSF analysis was performed on (b) (6)  with the results 
pending. The patient was tested positive for serum anti-JCV antibodies on 04 Apr 2012 at (b) (6)  The brain biopsy
was not done. Significant laboratory testing on (b) (6)  included leukocyte count (8.3 g/l; normal range: 4-10 
g/l), lymphocyte count (3.6 g/l; normal range not provided), and absolute lymphocyte count (43.8 %; normal range: 
20-52%). Treatment for suspected PML included mirtazapine starting from (b) (6) . The patient was planned 
to start PLEX on (b) (6)  No further information was provided.
Update 14 Oct 2014: The neurologist spontaneously reported that the first result of CSF JCV DNA PCR was 
positive with 820 copies. The neurologist therefore stated that for the patient, PML was "confirmed". The result of 
CSF JCV DNA testing from (b) (6)  was pending. No additional information was provided.
Update 16 Oct 2014: Biogen Idec considers this case confirmed for PML on (b) (6)  based on radiologic 
evidence and positive CSF for JCV. 
Update 22 Oct 2014: Additional information was provided by the neurologist via a Standard PML Data Collection 
form. The neurologist considered this case as confirmed PML. The patient was hospitalized from (b) (6)  to (b)(6)
(b) (6)  for PML and had resided in her home since (b) (6) . The patient was tested positive for serum anti-
JCV antibodies with an index value of 3.885 on (b) (6)  at(b) (6)  CSF analysis performed on (b) (6)
was normal described as clear as water before centrifugation and supernatant clear as water after centrifugation. 
The total number of cells is 3 (normal range: less than 3/ul). There were 18 cells counted. Few cells were in liquor. 
Lymphocyte subset analysis performed on (b) (6)  included CD3 of 2.53 g/l (normal range: 0.7-2.0; 74%), CD4
of 1.61 g/l (normal range: 0.6-1.6; 47%), CD8 of 0.71 g/l (normal range: 02.-0.8; 21%) and CD4/CD8 of 2.27 
(normal range 1.2-2.4). HIV test on an unknown date was negative. The patient received 5 sessions of PLEX from 
(b) (6)  to (b) (6)  At the time of this report, the event PML is ongoing. The causality for the event was 
assessed as related.

FOIA Case Report Information
Update 28 Dec 2014: The hospital neurologist spontaneously reported that the female patient was hospitalized for 
PML since (b) (6)  until her death on(b) (6)  The PML could not be controlled due to increased 
enlargement of the initial lesion of the right hemisphere with involvement of the basal ganglia and thalamus. The 
PML lesion also expanded frontally left across the corpus callosum and infiltration of the brain stem. IRIS was 
diagnosed (b) (6)  requiring the intravenous administration of Solu-Medrol (methylprednisolone) 1gram during
3 consecutive days per week. The patient received no steroids before the IRIS. The IRIS was mainly diagnosed via 
MRI, because the patient s condition had worsened consistently and continuously. The multifocal epileptic 
seizures, for the first time on (b) (6)  were probably caused by the IRIS, at least partly. The patient s 
movements were initially diminished, with increased worsening and finally left-sided tetraparetic and atactic. The 
patient was continuously comatose since the end of (b) (6)  At admission, the patient s Karnowski Score was 
50, but was soon 30, then 20 by mid (b) (6)  10 by the end of (b) (6)  The patient was fed by PEG tube from 
(b) (6)  onwards. The last MRI was performed on (b) (6)  No additional diagnostics were then 
performed in view of the incurable prognosis. At that time, IRIS was only moderately present. No autopsy was 
performed to respect the wish of the patient expressed. The PML is the cause of death, whereas the involvement of
the brain stem can be accepted as the cause of death. MRIs were performed on (b) (6) (b) (6) (b) (6)
(b) (6) (b) (6)  and the last on (b) (6)  (results not provided). No MS treatment was administered. No 
additional lumbar puncture was performed. No additional information was provided.
Update 05 Jan 2015: Additional information was received from the neurologist via a MS Standardized PML Data 
Collection Tool. The patient's height was reported as 168 cm and weight was 53 kg. Results from lumbar puncture 
performed on (b) (6)  revealed CSF JCV DNA at 207 copies per mL ((b) (6) ). The neurologist reported that prior 
Karnofsky and EDSS scores were not available as the patient was first seen on 10 Oct 2014. The patient was 
presumed to have a Karnofsky score of 90 (able to carry on normal activity; minor signs or symptoms of disease) 
prior to TYSABRI and prior to PML diagnosis. On an unspecified date at the time of PML diagnosis, the patient s 
Karnofsky score was 70 (cares for self; unable to carry on normal activity or to do active work). HIV test was 
negative on (b) (6)  At re-admission to the hospital on(b) (6)  the patient s Karnofsky Score was 50 
(requires considerable assistance and frequent medical care), then 20 (very sick; hospital admission necessary; 
active supportive treatment necessary) by mid Nov 2014, and 10 (moribund; fata processes progressing rapidly) by 
the end of Nov 2014. MRI at admission (date unspecified) revealed two large areas of increased T2 weighted signal
consistent with PML lesions, one in the right frontal lobe and one in the right cerebellar hemisphere. In the weeks 
thereafter the extensive PML lesion in the right frontal lobe progressively increased in size and extended to the 
parietal and temporal lobes with inclusion of the basal ganglia and thalamus. The lesion also extended across the 
corpus callosum, to the left frontal lobe. The infratentorial/ cerebellar PML lesion also progressed with expansion 
into the brainstem. After diagnostic work up and PLEX treatment, the patient was discharged from the hospital on 
(b) (6)  and re-admitted on (b) (6)  due to rapid clinical deterioration described as that the patient had 
become progressively less responsive and showed an increasing left-sided hemiparesis and dysarthria.  On (b) (6)

(b) (6)  the patient experienced first focal initiated grand mal seizure, antiepileptic treatment was started and the last 
seizure on (b) (6)  Solu-Medrol 1 GM IV was administered for treatment of IRIS on the following dates: (b)(6)  
(b) (6)  to (b) (6)  (b) (6)  to(b) (6)  (b) (6)  to (b) (6)  and (b) (6)  to (b) (6) . At time of death 
on (b) (6)  the patient had not recovered from PML and the outcome of the event of IRIS was unknown. The 
events of PML and IRIS were assessed as related to TYSABRI.
Update 02 Jun 2015: Additional information was provided by the neurologist. The patient received an head MRI on 
31 Oct 2007, 02 May 2008 (the patient was not under their care from Jul 2008 to Mar 2011), 20 Mar 2011, 08 Mar 
2012, 11 Apr 2013, 13 Mar 2014 (previously reported) and on 10 Oct 2014 (previously reported). The MRI 
examinations were performed initially in yearly intervals in accordance with the routine care. The investigation in 
October 2014 was carried out because of neuropsychological changes.
