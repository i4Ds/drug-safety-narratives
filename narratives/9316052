A 51 year old female patient on TYSABRI (300 mg, IV, QM) for Multiple Sclerosis since 02 Sep 2008 and enrolled 
in a Biogen Idec sponsored marketing program of Monitored Therapy reported experiencing trouble remembering, 
trouble finding the right word, and MS weakness (onsets 23 May 2013). Treatment included steroids. The events of 
trouble remembering, trouble finding the right word, and MS weakness are ongoing. Causality was not assessed. 
TYSABRI therapy continues.
Update 26 Jun 2013: A medical assistant reported via a Biogen Idec Medical Science Liaison that the 51 year old 
female patient on TYSABRI for MS x 60 infusions from 02 Sep 2008 to 28 May 2013 was hospitalized on(b) (6)  
(b) (6)  due to suspicion of PML characterized by changes on MRI, cognitive changes, memory loss and right side 
body weakness (onset (b) (6) ). Serum JCV antibody status is unknown. Her MS was diagnosed in Feb 1998; 
prior therapy with Copaxone. A lumbar puncture was performed; results are pending. Plasmapherisis is planned.

Update 27 Jun 2013: The same medical assistant provided the following information via telephone conversation 
and medical records. Patient tested serum JCV positive in Feb 2013, at the same time she describes a stable gait 
disturbance, memory impairment and parasthesisa. Brain MRI on 18 Mar 2013 noted large, confluent & focal sites 
of increased signal on FLAIR &T2 within the periventricular deep white matter & extending into peripheral 
subcortical white matter as well as corpus callosum, cerebellar peduncles & pons; no enhancement was noted She 
was treated with IV steroids and on 21 May was noted to be doing well and neurologically clinically stable. On (b)(6)  
(b) (6)  she presented with increasing problems with speech output. This prompts a LP and new brain MRI. Brain
MRI on(b) (6)  noted an interval development of a confluent irregular area of abnormal T2 high signal 
intensity/ T2 prolongation involving the white matter of the left parietal lobe & extending into the grey matter cortex- 
suspicious for PML, no definite enhancement was noted. CSF JCV PCR was obtained on(b) (6)  The patient 
was hospitalized and was to begin PLEX and IV steroids
Update 05 Jul 2013: Additional medical records received including CSF JCV PCR report which returned positive 
from(b) (6)  Additionally, CSF tested negative for VZV, HSV-1, HSV-2, and CMV.  Additional information is 
expected
Update 10 Jul 2013: Upon internal review, Biogen Idec considers this case to be confirmed for PML based on the 
positive CSF, MRI, and clinical symptoms.
Update 25 Jul 2013: The treating neurologist reported via a Biogen Idec Area Business Manager that the patient 
received PLEX and 5 days of IVIG and has been discharged from hospital. The neurologist also reported that the 
patient had a JCV antibody test on 19 Feb 2013 not a JCV DNA PCR test (discrepant from previous report). No 
further information was provided.
Update 09 Jan 2013: A healthcare professional from the neurologist's office reported that the patient was 
hospitalized in(b) (6)  for PML (previously reported as hospitalized in (b) (6) ). The patient has been 
discharged from hospital and is stable. No further information was provided. 
Update 06 May 2014: Upon follow-up, a nurse confirmed that that this PML patient is currently alive. No other 
information was provided. 
Update 18 Jul 2014:  The an unknown representative of the patient reported, via a program of Monitored Therapy, 
that she had a prolonged hospitalization on(b) (6)  due to being unable to care for herself (onset (b) (6)  
(b) (6) ) and being unable to speak (onset (b) (6) ); presumed symptoms of previously reported event of PML.
No testing or treatment was reported.  The events are ongoing.  The consumer did not provide a causality 
assessment.  TYSABRl therapy was withdrawn.

FOIA Case Report Information
Update 23 Jul 2014: The patient's sister reported that the patient is [currently] aphasic and is residing in a nursing 
home. No other information was provided.
Update 06 Aug 2014:  The patient's sister spontaneously reported that the patient was diagnosed with PML in (b) (6)  
(b) (6)   The patient's hospitalization was prolonged in (b) (6)  by immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome 
(IRIS) (onset (b) (6) ).  The patient became paralyzed on her whole right side and her ability to speak was 
affected; the patient can no longer speak.  Treatment included plasmapheresis.  The event of IRIS is ongoing.  The 
consumer did not provide a causality assessment.  TYSABRl therapy was discontinued.
Update 12 Aug 2014:  The patient's sibling spontaneously reported that the patient was hospitalized in 2013 for 
PML, a brain infection (presumed in reference to PML), and experienced Broca's aphasia (presumed symptom of 
PML) and IRIS.  The patient is currently in a nursing home.  The event of PML is ongoing.  The outcome for the 
event of IRIS is unknown (discrepant information).  The consumer did not provide a causality assessment.
TYSABRl therapy was discontinued.
Update 19 Aug 2014:  The patient's sister, who is also a registered nurse (RN) re-reported that the patient 
experienced global aphasia (presumed in reference to previously reported Broca's aphasia), right sided weakness, 
and paralysis (presumed symptoms of PML).  No additional information was reported.
Update 16 Mar 2015:  The following report was received from literature.  Zhang Y, Dubey D, De Sena A, Graves D, 
Frohman E, and Greenberg B.  Use of IL-2 for management of natalizumab associated progressive multifocal 
leukoencephalopathy.  67th annual meeting of the American academy of neurology (ANN); Washington, DC; USA. 
17 Apr 2015.  A 51 year old woman with RRM and a 3 year history of natalizumab use developed expressive 
aphasia.  An MRI brain showed left frontotemporal lesion with contrast enhancement and CSF JCV PCR was 
positive.  She received 5 cycles of plasmapheresis followed by IVIG.  Her speech deteriorated and she developed 
right hemiparesis.  CSF quantitative PCR was positive for JCV DNA at 834 copies/ mL.  The patient was given an 
initial dose of 50,000 units of IL-2 SC followed by 1,000,000 units IL-2 SC daily.  The patient also received IV 
methylprednisolone weekly due to concern for immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS).  The patient 
was monitored with weekly brain MRIs and quantitative CSF JCV titers.  Subsequent CSF showed decreased JCV 
titers to 240 copies/ mL after one week and to 43 copies/ mL at two weeks.  The patient showed clinical 
improvement and became more responsive and regained right lower extremity antigravity strength.  After 12 weeks 
of IL-2 therapy, JCV titers leveled at 31 copies/ mL.  Due to persistence of JCV, IL-2 was discontinued and the 
patient was switched to mefloquine.  At 1 month follow-up the patient showed no clinical deterioration.

Update 20 Aug 2015:  A report was received from literature.  Zhang Y, Dubey D, Graves D, DeSena A D, Frohman 
E, and Greenberg B.  A case report of IL-2 therapy for natalizumab associated progressive multifocal 
leukoencephalopathy.  Poster presentation.  This case is in reference to the 51 year old woman.  The patient's CSF
was positive for JCV DNA at 70 copies/mL at 3 weeks of treatment.  AN MRI at 4 weeks of therapy showed some 
contrast enhancement in the left fronto-parietal region concerning for development of IRIS.  Treatment included IV 
methylprednisone.  An MRI, following completion of 12 weeks of IL-2 therapy, showed reduced contrast 
enhancement.
