Medically Significant
A registered nurse spontaneously reported that a  41 year old male patient on TYSABRI (300 mg, IV, QM) for 
Multiple Sclerosis from 2010 to unknown date was hospitalized from (b) (6)  to an unknown date for PML 
suspicion (onset (b) (6) ). On (b) (6)  as the patient was at the hospital for an infusion of TYSABRI, the 
Brain MRI showed a suspicion of PML that led to hospitalization. According to the reporter, the patient had received
a total 48 doses of TYSABRI infusion prior to this event. The outcome for the event PML suspicion is unknown. The
causality for the event of PML suspicion is unknown.  TYSABRI therapy was withdrawn. French Imputability: 
C1S1I1

another city hence was not able to provide further information. French Imputability: C1S1I1
Update 20 Nov 2014: Upon internal review, Biogen Idec considers this case to be low suspect due to lack of CSF 
and clinical data despite exhaustive follow up attempts.  This case will be closed and no additional follow-up is 
expected.
Update 05 Dec 2014: A radiologist spontaneously reported that the patient had been hospitalized for PML. She saw
him for routine MRIs. The patient is well at the time of this report. French Imputability unchanged: C1S1I1.
Update 23 Dec 2014: Follow-up information was received from the neurologist.  TYSABRI was the suspect product 
for PML. It was administered from Jul 2010 to Mar 2014 without interruption. No previous MS medication had been 
given.  Anti-JCV antibody status was tested but results were unknown.  At the time of reporting, patient was at 
home.  PML suspicion was based on signs and symptoms (aphasia with onset on Feb 2014) prompted by MRI 
finding that revealed PML suspicion. MRI at the time of PML suspicion was performed on 18 Apr 2014 (NOS). MRI 
was performed on 30 Apr 2014 and compared to previous one done on 07 Dec 2012 showed a new active lesion 
was noticed in the left precentral gyrus. Confluent FLAIR and T2 hypersignals and T1 hyposignals compatible with 
PML were observed in the parahippocampal gyrus and in the left lateral temporal and occipital gyrus.  MS 
symptoms were characterized by left leg paresis (EDSS was 3). A lumbar puncture was performed on 30 Apr 2014.
Local JCV PCR testing returned positive. No further CSF analysis and no biospy were performed. According to the 
neurologist, PML diagnosis was confirmed based on PCR JCV testing results.  No further MS treatment was 
administered. Corticosteroids IV were administered from 20 Jun 2014 to 25 Jun 2014. No plasmatic exchange 
performed. The event was considered as resolved with sequelae (aphasia) at the time of reporting.  French 
Imputability: C2S2I2
Update 02 Jan 2015: Upon internal review, Biogen Idec considers this case to be confirmed for PML based on 
positive CSF, MRI findings, and clinical symptoms.
Update 10 Apr 2015: Additional information was received from a neurologist via a Standardized MS PML Data 
Collection Tool. On an unspecified date, the patient had a negative HIV test result and was tested for serum anti-
JCV antibody status (result not reported). The patient's estimated Karnofsky and EDSS scores on 12 Jul 2013 were
100 (normal no complaints; no evidence of disease) and 2, respectively. MRI was performed prior to PML diagnosis
in Dec 2013 (results not reported). The patient's estimated Karnofsky and EDSS scores were assessed to be 40 
(disabled; requires special care and assistance) and 5 on 25 Apr 2014 and on 29 Apr 2014. MRI was performed at 
the time of PML diagnosis on 29 Apr 2014 (results not reported). The patient tested positive for CSF JCV DNA on 
30 Apr 2014 (previously reported). Leukocyte count on 30 Apr 2014 was 7.9 x10(9)/L (normal range 4.0 - 10.0). The
patient was diagnosed with IRIS, which was determined by clinical symptoms and MRI findings. The onset of IRIS

symptoms was 06 May 2014 and included aphasia (speech). The patient did not receive corticosteroids pre-IRIS 
onset and received corticosteroids 3 GM IV from 09 May 2014 to 11 May 2014. At the time of this report, the patient
was alive and was residing at home. The patient has recovered from PML as of 09 Apr 2015, and has recovered 
from IRIS as of 24 Jun 2014. Causality of the events of PML and IRIS was assessed as related to TYSABRI.
Update 28 Sep 2015: A report was received from literature. Carra-Dalliere, C., Menjot de Champfleur, N., 
Deverdun, J., Ayrignac, X., Nerrant, E., Makinson, A., Casanova, M.-L., Labauge, P. Insight Medmeme. Use of 
quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) in progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, Paper presented at 31st 
Congress of the European Committee for Treatment and Research in Multiple Sclerosis (ECTRIMS); 2015 October
06; Barcelona, Spain. The authors in this abstract try to understand the signification of SWI hypointensities recently 
described in U-fibers and cortex adjacent to the white matter lesions of PML and mean PML duration of 24.2 
months. A prospective study was conducted which included 4 male patients with a history of definite diagnosis of 
PML; one patient was noted to have received immunosuppression with natalizumab for MS. Clinical data were 
collected retrospectively and brain MRI exams were done on a 3T magnet, including FLAIR, T2 GRE sequences 
and SWI.  The conclusion was that SWI and T2 GRE hypointensities in cortex and U-fibers adjacent to the white 
matter lesions seem highly present in PML, whatever the delay between PML onset and the MRI. QSM data 
suggest a paramagnetic effect.
