This dinical trialliallingl. case concerns a 57-year-old Caucasian female. The patient's medical history 
ed: non-small cell lung cancer with abdominal cutaneous metastases, right mediastinal and hilar adenopathy 
with supraclavicular lymphadenopathy, previous deep vein thrombosis (Jun10), Hypertension, Dyslipidemia, 
Ost o  osis and history of post obstructive pneumonia, skin cancer (basal cell carcinoma), colon polyps (Aug-08), 
bladder neck polyps and hematuria. Patient currently receiving radiation therapy. Concomitant medications 
included: nffeclipine, pantoprazole sodium, dexamethasone, oxycodone hydrochloride, atorvastatin calcium, 
warfarin sodium, metoprolot, omeprazole (gastroesophageal reflux disease), sertraline hydrochloride (anxiety), 
docusate and senna alexadrina (constipation), calcium phosphate, calcium sodium lactate, er. I ciferol, 
flab oil and Cia xacln hydrochloride (shortness of breath). Patient also received folic acid and vitamin B-12 (but 
not within 7 days prior to the event) On 13May2010, the patient initially received pemetrexed disodium (Alimta) 
500 mg/m2, intravenously (IV), in combination with carboplatin, 6 AUC, IV and bevacizumab, 15 mg/kg, IV, all every 
21 days, for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer stage (NSCLC). Prior to the event, the study therapy was 
last r on 03Jun2010 and on this date, taken off study drug secondary to disease progression. On 
24Jun2010, the patient was discontinued from the study and off protocol. Onglin. approximately *days 
after last receiving dose of study drugs, the patient presented with complaints of right calf and ankle pain and 
swelling. A color duplex ultrasound of the bilateral lower extremities was performed and results were as follows: 
acute occlusive deep venous thrombosis in right popliteal vein, right posterior tibial veins, right gastrocnemius veins 
and right peroneal veins. The patient was diagnosed with a deep vein thrombosis (DVT) grade 3. The patient was 
also experiencing dyspnea/SOB (grade 3). A chest computerized tomography scan (CT) was negative for 
pulmonary embolism (PE), The patient was admitted to the hospital on the same day. On the patient 
was discharged from the hospital. The events of DVT and dyspnea were ongoing at the time of discharge. On 
the patient presented to the emergency room with complaints of left leg and foot pain. A color duplex 
ultra of the left lower extremity s -0 acute occlusive and non-occlusive deep venous thrombosis of left leg. 
The patientwas started on IV heparin and admitted to the hospital. Although patient had a normal kidney function 
two days prior to this hospitalization, she was found to have a creatinine of 4.5 and diagnosed with acute renal 
failure. See source document for numerous creatinine results. Her kidney functions initially became worse with 
creatinine reaching the level of 7, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) was reached 126. IV hydration gradually helped that. 
Renal functions started improving. Patient also noted to have mild hypematremia and mild hypokalemia. Patient 
has history of chronic anemia and did require multiple units of blood transfusions. No evidence of hemolysis. Tests 
performed (with results) included: Ultrasound doppler of abdomen revealed no gallstones, right renal enlargement 
which could reflect underlying edema, pyelonephntis is a consideration. Chest x-ray revealed persistent right middle 
lobe atelectasis with possible right mediastinal hilar lymphadenopathy, new small right pleural effusion, no new 
focal a  0,  y, right lung base considered early pneumonia. Lower extremity operative studies showed acute 
occlusive and sive deep venous thrombosis of the left leg. A renal vein doppler study revealed patent 
bilateral nmal veins and intra kidney veins with no evidence of thrombosis. On , the event of dyspnea 
was considered resolved. On 07-Jul-2010 the patient presented platelet count of 64k/mm3 (reference 150-400),

potassium 5.7mmol/L (reference range 3.5-5.1) and hemoglobin of 7.8g/di (reference 1.2.0-16.0). Laboratory results 
from 08-Jul-2010 included: sodium 128mmo1/1(reference 135-145), chloride 87mmol/l (reference 98-106), carbon 
dioxide 17mmo1/1 (reference 24-32), anion gap 24mmo1/1 (reference 4-14), BUN 110mg/d1 (reference 8-21), 
creatinine 7.07mg/d1 (reference 0.51-0.95), estimated glomerular filtration rate 6m1/min (reference greater than 60), 
calcium 8.0mg/dI (reference 8.5-10.5), protein total 5.9g/dl (reference 6.2-8.4), albumin 3.0g/di (reference 3.5-5.0), 
alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 42u/I (reference 10-36), phosphorus 9.3mg/d1 (reference 2.7-4.5), and lactate 
dehydrogenase 1035u11 (reference 135-235). A recuperating ultrasound revealed echogenic kidneys which showed 
normal sized to slightly enlarged; could be seen with the renal vein thrombosis. Patient also received palliative 
radiation treatment during hospitalization. Also it was stated that the patient presented mild tumor lysis syndrome 
shown by potassium 5.7mmo1/1(reference 3.5-5.1), and phosphorus 9.5mg/dI (reference 2.7-4.5) on the 07-Jul-
2010 and calcium 8.2mg/d1 (reference 8.5-10.5), on the 10-Jul-2010. On 17-Jul-2010 the patient presented fever 
suspected to be likely, tumor fever and received sulbactam ampicillin for it with hemoglobin of 10.8g/dl. Laboratory 
data prior to discharge on included sodium 134, potassium 3.3, chloride 95, bicarbonate 22, creatinine 
1.78, calcium 8.7, white cell count 6.4, hemoglobin 10.6, hematocrit 30, platelet count 54, magnesium 1.7. Liver 
function tests unremarkable. Urine cultures grew mixed gram-positive organism 50-100,000 colonies. Blood 
cultures negative for any growth. BUN was 21 and creatinine was 1.78. Qp the patient recovered with 
sequelae from the events of thrombus/DVT (right leg) and thrombus/DVT (left leg). On the same day, MINIM 
the patient was discharged from the hospital with platelet count of 60k/mm3 (reference 150-400) and on 
fondaparinux sodium for DVT and to follow up with primary care physician (PCP) and oncologist. It was stated that 
the events of thrombocytopenia, fever and anemia were not serious adverse events. The investigator also 
confirmed dyspnea/SOB was only a symptom, On 12-Aug-2010, the patient recovered from the acute renal failure. 
Additional information has been requested. In the opinion of the investigator, the grade 3 thrombosis/DVT (right 
leg), grade 3 d o  a, grade 3 thrombosis/DVT (left leg), and grade 3 acute renal failure were not related to study 
drugs or protocol procedures. The investigator indicated "disease process" as an explanation of the his opinion. 
Updated 05Aug10: additional information received 29Jul10 - 2nd event of DVT not related to s.therapy/protocol 
procedures; acute renal failure not related; dc date for 2nd hosp; recovering from both events; pt. off study drug; 
origin, added folic acid and vit b-12; ca with mets added, hx of dvt 10Jun10; radiation therapy received; numerous 
tests performed with results; dc labs; mild hypematremia and mild hypokalemia; anemia which req transfusions. 
Update 01-Feb-2011: Additional information received on 24-Jan-2011. Laboratory data, confirmation anemia, fever 
and thrombocytopenia non SAE, start date for dexamethasone, confirmation of laboratory evidence of mild tumor 
lysis syndrome. Updated corresponding fields and narrative accordingly. Update 08-Feb-2011: Additional 
information received on 31-Jan-2011 from the study investigator. Additions/changes: Medical history, concomitant 
medications, and BUN result added; event outcomes updated; investigator's opinion updated to not related to study
