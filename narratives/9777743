A neurologist reported via a Biogen Idec company representative that a patient (no identifying details provided) on 
TYSABRI (unknown dose, IV, unknown frequency) for Multiple Sclerosis from an unknown date to an unknown date
experienced suspected PML since 1 and half week ago (presumed onset Aug 2013).  The event of suspected PML 
is ongoing. The causality for the event of suspected PML was not assessed.  It is unknown if TYSABRI treatment is
ongoing.
Update 19 Aug 2013: The neurologist reported via a Biogen Idec company representative that the patient is a 33 
year old male who experienced symptoms (NOS) since the beginning of Jul 2013 but was not suspected for PML 
until 31 Jul 2013. Testing and treatment for the event of suspicion of PML was not reported. The event of suspected

PML is ongoing. Indication for TYSABRI is Multiple Sclerosis and insufficient efficacy under Betaferon. The number 
of TYSABRI infusions received to date is unknown. No further information was provided.
Update 22 Aug 2013: The physician spontaneously reported that the patient is currently stable. JCV liquor PCR 
testing was negative when tested at 3 different Swiss labs. A sample will also be sent to (b) (6)  lab for further 
testing. No further information was provided.
Update 27 Aug 2013: The neurologist reported that the patient was diagnosed with MS since 2008. PML was 
suspected in Aug 2008 (previously reported as Jul 2013) due to clinical symptoms of paralysis of the arm and fine 
motor skill distortion on the right.  The patient is anti-JCV antibody negative  (Aug 2011). Testing included JCV PCR
test (06 Aug 2013) sent to local lab which was negative in liquor and a MRI (Aug 2013) which identified suspected 
PML. TYSABRI therapy was started in Dec 2010 and stopped in Jul 2013. Current treatment includes Remeron 
(mirtazapine) 45mg and Mephaquin (mefloquine) 250mg once a week since Aug 2013. Basic therapy will be re-
evaluated in 3 months. No further information was provided. 
ADDENDUM: Upon review on 11 Sep 2013, it was noted the patient's JCV antibody status and date of PML 
suspicion were incorrectly reported in Update 27 Aug 2013. The patient is anti-JCV antibody positive (Aug 2011) 
and was suspected of PML in Aug 2013.
Update 13 Dec 2013: The neurologist reported that the patient was diagnosed with MS on 15 Mar 2008 and 
showed the following signs and symptoms associated with possible PML included for cognitive and behaviorial: 
attention slightly decreased (onset Aug 2013), motor and focal: right hand (onset Jul 2013), and speech (NOS).
The patient's MS disease symptoms prior to the PML diagnosis for focal: included flexion spasticity of the left arm, 
visual: bilateral, cerebellar: esis left, sensory: hypoesthesia medial feet border right, and saccadic eye movement.
The patient was reported to have not received prior immunosuppressant therapy; however, the patient was 
previously on betaseron (interferon beta-1b) for RRMS every other day from 30 Apr 2008 to 26 Aug 2010.  The 
patient was on TYSABRI from 01 Dec 2013 (discrepant date; presumed the year was 2010) to 01 Aug 2013.  The 
patient has not experienced an interruption of TYSABRI therapy in the past three months.  The patient did undergo 
5 sessions of plasma exchange (PLEX)  on 02 Aug 2013, 03 Aug 2013, 05 Aug 2013, 07 Aug 2013, and 09 Aug 
2013.  The patient did not undergo immunoadsorption (IA).  PML treatment included Mefloquine 250mg PO from 01
Aug 2013 to 01 Nov 2013 and Mirtazapine 45mg PO 1/d from 01 Aug 2013 to 20 Nov 2013.   The patient was 
reported to have never been in a Biogen Idec clinical trial nor is currently enrolled in a clinical trial.  A MRI prior to

PML diagnosis on 06 Feb 2013 showed unchanged lesion status compared to Feb 2012. No signs of activity and 
no signs of PML. Since 2008 there has been a moderate loss of cerebral volume.  A MRI was performed at the time
of diagnosis on 01 Aug 2013 that showed new signal enhanced surfaces in Gyrus frontalis superior and Gyrus 
precentral left, without activity. Differential diagnosis: early stage of PML. Otherwise stationary, unchanged lesion 
status also without activity. Testing included a lumbar puncture on 20 Mar 2008 that was negative for CSF JCV 
DNA, on 01 Aug 2013 that was negative for CSF JCV DNA, and on 06 Aug 2013 negative for CSF JCV DNA.  A 
brain biopsy was not performed.  The patient tested positive for anti-JCV antibodies in Aug 2011 and positive again 
on 20 Aug 2013.  THE CSF analysis on an unknown date was normal.  The CBC pre-TYSABRI on 01 Dec 2010 
showed an EOS of 0.51 (reference range 0.02 - 0.40) other the results were normal and the CBC Pre-PLEX on 31 
Jul 2013 showed: Leu 11.3 G/l (reference range 3.5 - 10.5), EOS 0.90 G/l (reference range 0.02 - 0.40), Mon 1.24 
G/l (reference range 0.20 - 0.93 G/l), Lymph 4.07 G/l (reference range 1.10 - 3.50), stab cell 20% (reference range 
3 - 18), segmented 25% (reference range 35 - 67), and otherwise normal.  The CD 4 results Pre-TYSABRI and 
Pre-PLEX were not available.  PML has not been ruled out and the final diagnosis was reported as status after IRIS
Sep 2013 upon severe and progressive PML with the initial diagnosis in Aug 2013.  The patient is currently home.
The outcome is ongoing and causality was related to TYSABRI.  TYSABRI was discontinued on 01 Aug 2013.
Update 18 Dec 2013: Upon internal review this case was determined to be a high suspect case due to MRI and 
final call.
Update 21 Dec 2013:  The neurologist clarified that PML was not ruled out and that the explanation "Status after 
IRIS Sep-2013 upon severe and progressive PML (1st diagnosis Aug-2013)" was associated with the report that 
PML has not been ruled out.  No further information was reported.
Update 21 Jan 2014:  The neurologist provided the MRI images from 06 Feb 2013, 01 Aug 2013, 12 Aug 2013, 01 
Sep 2013, 10 Oct 2013, and 12 Nov 2013.  The details were not reported.  No further information was reported.
Update 19 Jun 2014: The neurologist reported via a data collection tool the patient had three lumbar punctures: 01 
Aug 2013 which was negative from Klinishe Mikrobiologie, 06 Aug 2013 which was negative from Medizinische 
Mikrobiologie, and 06 Aug 2010 (discrepant from previous reports) which was negative from (b) (6) . On 13 Dec 2013, 
the patient tested negative for HIV, and the neurologist re-reported the patient tested JCV antibody positive in Aug 
2011, and 20 Aug 2013. The neurologist provided Karnofsky and EDSS assessments for the patient at the following
time points: Karnofsky score of 100 (27 Aug 2010, prior to starting TYSABRI), EDSS score of 3.0 (26 Aug 2010, 
prior to starting TYSABRI), Karnofsky score of 100 (13 Feb 2013, on TYSABRI prior to PML), EDSS score of 2.5 
(13 Feb 2013, on TYSABRI prior to PML), and Karnofsky score of 90 (20 Aug 2013, at the time of PML concern), 
EDSS score of 3.5 (20 Aug 2013, at the time of PML concern). The neurologist stated the patient had MRI's 
performed on 01 Aug 2013 and 02 Feb 2013 (discrepant from previous report). He additionally provided the

following detailed brain MRI reports: 06 Feb 2013: Unchanged lesional load compared to Jul 2012. No signs of 
activity and no signs of PML. Moderate loss of cerebral volume since 2008. 01 Aug 2013: New area of subcortical 
signal enhancement without activity in the gyrus frontalis superior and gyrus precentralis left. Differential diagnosis: 
early stage of PML. Otherwise unchanged lesional load without activity. 01 Sep 2013: Newly appeared contrast 
enhancements and increasing swelling of the PML suspected signal alterations in the subcortical medullar latyers of
the Gyrus frontalis superior and Gyrus praecentralis links, as well as increased edematous changes around the 
PML suspected signals. The latter is suspected to be due to IRIS.  In additino new small contrast-enhancements, in
part of pre-existing plaques in the medullar layer of the gyrus frontalis inferior, in the frontal medullar layer left and 
gyrus frontalis medius. 12 Nov 2013: Stationary (unchanged) intracranial and cervical marrow lesional load upon 
known MS. No signs of inflammatory activity. After PML/IRIS involution of the edema in the gyrus praecentralis left. 
New discrete barrier disorder, most probably due to reactive reparation process. 05 Feb 2014: No new lesions. IRIS
with contrast medium enhancement adjacent to the previous central region left of the PML, assumed to be due to 
rebound upon restoration of the immune-competence. The bilateral punctiform contrast medium enhancements are
of the same origin. The differential diagnosis of active MS plaques is rather unlikely since no confirmed T2 
hyperintensity correlations are present. On 12 May 2014, the neurologist assessed the PML as not recovered and 
related to TYSABRI. The neurologist stated the patient further deteriorated during the development of IRIS with a 
marked dysarthria and a paresis/tremor of the right arm. His EDSS was assessed as 4.0 and he was residing at 
home. Additional information is expected.
