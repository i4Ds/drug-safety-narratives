This clinical trial case, concerns a 29 year old Caucasian male patient. 
The medical history was reported as not applicable (no relevant history). The patient had received three cycles of 
unspecified chemotherapy and it was reported that the patient had tolerated this induction of chemotherapy well 
and that there were no delays or dose reductions. On the 12-Jul-2012 at baseline a chest and abdominal 
computerised tomography scan concluded partial response with right sided pulmonary thromboembolic disease 
with possible infarct (full report available). On 01-Aug-2012 a chest x-ray concluded appearance was suggestive of 
a left hilar mass with associated lymphangitis. Concomitant medications were folic acid, cyancobalamin as 
supplementation, dexamethasone and lansoprazole for prophylaxis, morphine for chest pain and enoxaparin for 
embolism. 
On 02-Aug-2012 the patient commenced pemetrexed at 500 mg/m2 (intravenous) on day one every 21 days for

advanced non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer, and the last dose prior to the event was administered on 02-
Aug-2012. On the 15-Aug-2012 the patient started to receive clarithromycin for a respiratory infection. On OM 
T days after the last dose of pemetrexed was administered, the patient was hospitalized due to lower 
respiratory infection CTC grade III. The patient was also noted to have chest pain CTC grade I which was not 
considered serious. A chest x-ray was performed on the which concluded that when compared to 
previous radiography there was now evidence of bilateral pleural effusion. There were no other significant changes 
noted. The patient received intravenous piperacillin sodium/tazobactam sodium for three days and continued to 
receive clarithromycin. On the second day of admission the chest pain had also settled. The patient was then 
switched from piperacillin sodium/tazobactam sodium to oral amoxicillin sodium/clavulanate potassium and stayed 
apyrexial for three da s. No laboratory data was provided as patient admitted to another hospital. The patient was 
discharged o in a recovering state with oral antibiotics that included clarithromycin (clarithromycin 
_was la1sted rec deaivyse  on e 28-Aug-2012). On an unspecified date the patient recovered from the event. On the.. since the first/last dose of study drug, the patient was admitted to hospital. The patient had 
increasing shortness of breath and it was thought that the patient had a respiratory infection. The patient was 
treated with piperacillin sodium/tazobactam sodium and clarithromycin and also received megestrol for weight loss, 
codeine for chest pain/cough and morphine for chest pain. A chest x-ray at 04.45 hours concluded subjective 
impression of increased density of consolidation in the left lung but this could be due to projection, otherwise there 
was no significant change since last x-ray on theall.111.(bilateral effusion as before). Laboratory data on the

atypical pneumonia. The risk factors for this event included the underlying condition of lung cancer, chemotherapy 
treatment and the previous hospitalisation. The patient rapidly deteriorated and on the-died. No 
autopsy was performed but the investigator reported that the primary cause of death was pneumonia secondary to 
lung cancer. It was reported that there was nothing documented in the patient's notes indicating disease 
progression. Therapy with pemetrexed was continued up and till the patient's death.
