This special surveillance (H3E-JE-AK01, PMS Non-Interventional) case, concerns a 65-year-old male. The patient 
hada history of smoking (30 cigarettes per day for 40 years), social alcohol drinking, gastric cancer with operation 
at 52-year-old and family history of lung cancer (brother). He was diagnosed with pleural mesothelioma malignant 
(MPtif, histologicai diagnosis: epithelial type, stage IV) with left pleural effusion and metastases to chest wall. He 
w.as suffering from tumour associated fever and anaemia. He had no histories of asbestos exposure, pulmonary 
0  0. allergy, .  tosis, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, surgery and any other treatments for MPH. He received 
multiple concomitant medications including folic acid, vitamin 812 and predonisolone. On 02-Apr-2008, 
echocardiography a mild tricuspid regurgitation (TR). Reticular shadow and gland-grass opacity (GGO) in 
bilateral lower king fields were revealed with chest X-ray on 01-Apr-2008 and 1A-Hay-2008 and with chest CT on 
03-Apr-2008 and on 16-May-2008. On 16-May-2008, Krebs von den lungen-6 (KL-6) and pulmonary surfactant 
protein-D , (SP-D) were 226 1.1/mL and 87.4 rigIrnt.. On 07-Apr-2008, respiratory function test was FEV1.0 72.4% 
and FVC 2100 rnL, which   :.a restrictive disorder and impaired diffusion. On 22-May-2008, auscultation showed 
fine crackles in. bilateral lower . 0 .4re al fields, mainly right lung field and saturation of 4,  0in (Sp02.) was 97% 
(room air). On 7?-777-2008, his Pa02 and PaCO2 werenormal (87 Torr and 31 Torr). The investigator judged he 
had .  e0   . of interstitial king disease (ILD) prior to starting the study drugs. No oedema and cyanosis were 
observed. Performance status at initiation of protocol on the ECOG/Zubrod scale was 1. Base line lab data on the 
same day was as .0'. 0  : body temperature (BT) 36.8 degrees Celsius (0/C), white blood cell (WBC) 13900/mcL,

Ilildays after initiating the study drugs, he developed pyrexia and dyspnoea and chest X-ray showed diffuse 
reticular  and GGO, mainly in the right middle and lower lung.fields. On1111.11.111.1, his body temperature 
was 39.0 0/C. Hypoxernia (Pa02 76 Torr,  0  sexy  4 min, nasal cannula) and .expansion of hearing area of 
fine crackles.by auscultation were observed. On ilibdays after the first and last administration, he 
developeddyspnoea and chest X-ray showed reticular shadow and GGO in bilateral lower lung fields. Chest CT 
newly developed diffuse GGO, thickening of interlobular septum and traction bronctilectasis, mainly in.the 
 Aght. king due to diffuse alveolar damage. Cefepime dihydrochloride hydrate and inhalation of oxygen (.3 Limin.) 
siere started as corrective treatment. He developed Lyrn decreased (seriousness reported as prolonged 
heapitalization). Lab data on the same day was as follows: 8T 36.8 DEC, Sp02 93% (under  .: . 5L/min), WBC

pheurnocyslis pneumonia, cytomegalovirus pneumonia and cardiac failure (by echocardiogram). On the same date, 
0 pulse therapy (methylprednisoione 1g) was administered for three days as corrective treatment. Onemii 
imiSpO2 was 95% (under oxygen 6 L/min). On 29-May-2008, steroid therapy was switched to predonisolone 50 
mg/day but his respiratory condition was gradually aggravated. He suddenly developed ventricular tachycardia (VT)

a examinations were not performed: pulmonary function test, bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), lung biopsy, 
culture, a  **  a culture, drug lymphocyte stimulation test (DLST). O Sp02 was 90% (under 
OXygert 8 Limin). WBC and Neut decreased were resolved but Lym decreased was not resolved. WBC, Neut and 
Lyin were 4000/mcL,  .. mcL and 200ImcL, respectively. onal1111111 he also developed disseminated 
intravascular coagulation (DIG, seriousness reported as life-threatening). On he died of respiratory 
failure caused by ILD. The INC was not resolved. Attempted to obtain I ol number;'  .'  was 
unknown. The investigator considered the ILD was related to pemetrexed, but did not know the causality between 
the 1LD and carboplatin. He considered the WBC, Neut and Lym decreased were related to pemetrexed and 
carboplatin. He didnot know the causality between the VT and pemetrexed and c aea . tin, but related to ILD and 
underlying disease. ttle stated the DIC was related to pemetrexed, but did not mention the causality between DIC 
and carboptatin. No further information was expected. Case closed. Updated on 16-Jun-2000: additional
