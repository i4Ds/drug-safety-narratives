Medically Significant
A neurologist spontaneously reported via a Biogen Area Business Manager (ABM) that a patient on TYSABRI (300 
mg, IV, QM) for Multiple Sclerosis since unknown date experienced suspect PML (onset unknown).  The patient 
had an MRI (unknown date) that showed a new small brain lesion. The patient will also be having a lumbar 
puncture done for CSF JCV DNA testing. The event of suspect PML is ongoing. Causality for the event is unknown.
 TYSABRI therapy continues.
Update 06 Apr 2015: Upon telephone follow-up with the neurologist, the neurologist identified the patient and 
indicated that the female patient had a lumbar puncture "last week," which was negative for CSF JCV DNA. The 
neurologist did not know which lab or the sensitivity of the PCR assay. The patient is JCV antibody positive with a 
high index, which was 3.2 (date unknown) and now down to 2.6 (date unknown). The neurologist plans to repeat 
the MRI in a couple of weeks to exclude PML. At this point, the suspicion for PML is low. The patient continuously 
complains of numbness on the right side but otherwise is stable. At the time of this report, the TOUCH database 
indicated that the patient had received a total of 58 infusions of TYSABRI from 04 Jun 2008 to 05 Mar 2015. The 
neurologist indicated that he wanted the patient to be off of TYSABRI, but the patient wants to continue because of 
its efficacy. 
Update 06 Apr 2015: Additional information received from the neurologist indicated that the patient had been 
receiving TYSABRI every other month since Nov 2010. The neurologist indicated that the alternate dose was the 
patient's choice and that when he started seeing the patient she was already on that dosing schedule.
