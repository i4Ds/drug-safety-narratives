Company Comment 04FEB2016 : Upon follow up from Alexion Quality Assurance  this case remains a serious, 
medically confirmed spontaneous report of death (F,MS), seizure(MS) Renal osteodystrophy (MS), IgA nephropathy
(MS), Pyrexia (MS). Pyrexia is listed; while the other serious events are unlisted in the CCDS. There is insufficient 
information to make a reasonable causal assessment between the serious events of Pyrexia, death and  seizure 
and Soliris. Although clinical details are lacking, the events of Renal osteodystrophy and  IgA nephropathy are 
unlikely related to Soliris and more likely related to underlying disease.
