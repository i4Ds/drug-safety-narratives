Huis in't Veld D, Lukande R, Lammens M, Conesa-Botella A, Vlieghe E, Van Marck E, et al. The immune 
reconstitution inflammatory syndrome: A cause of death in persons on antiretroviral therapy? Acta-Clin-Belg 2013; 
A 44-year-old HIV-positive man who received antiretrovirals [ routes and dosages not stated ] developed immune 
reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS), leading to complications including disseminated aspergillosis. He was 
hospitalised in (b) (6)  with hemiparesis; he had stopped his antiretroviral therapy 4 years earlier. MRI 
revealed a right fronto-temporal brain lesion; PCR testing was positive for polyomavirus. He started antiretroviral 
therapy 15 days later, with zidovudine, lamivudine, abacavir, saquinavir and ritonavir; his CD4+ count was 10 
cells/microL. A week later, he developed a submandibular abscess, with acid-fast bacilli; his brain lesion increased. 
The abscess was drained, and he received methylprednisolone 48 mg/day [ route not stated ] for a month, followed 
by 32 mg/day. He also received rifampicin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, ethambutol and clarithromycin; he improved 
clinically. Pus culture revealed a Mycobacterium avium complex infection infection.
 He was hospitalised 6 weeks later, with dyspnoea, fever, fatigue and loss of appetite. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid 
testing revealed cytomegalovirus (CMV). He died due to cerebral and pulmonary oedema 2.5 months after starting 
antiretroviral therapy. Autopsy revealed necrotising bronchopneumonia (considered to be the most likely immediate 
cause of death) due to invasive aspergillosis, a CMV lung infection, and progressive multifocal 
leukoencephalopathy; his kidneys had Gram-positive cocci.
