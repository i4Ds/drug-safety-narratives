Case number# PHHY2015DE069758, is a combined initial spontaneous report and three follow up reports received
from a physician on 09 Jun 2015, 10 Jun 2015, 17 Jun 2015 and 18 Jun 2015, respectively via Sales 
Representative, with follow up report received from a physician (neurologist) via pharmaceutical company Biogen 
(reference number: 2015BI080025) on 29 Jun 2015, with a subsequent follow up report received from a physician 
on 19 Aug 2015.
This report refers to a 48 year old female patient. The patient did not have history of HIV (human immunodeficiency
virus) infection, malignancy, sarcoidosis and any other disturbances of the immune system. The physician stated 
that patient was treated from 15 May 2008 until 13 Jan 2015 with natalizumab 300 mg intravenously every four 
weeks (86 administrations). On 13 Oct 2014, positive JCV (John Cunningham virus) index was detected, but there 
was no quantitative measurement performed. Treatment with natalizumab was discontinued due to risk benefit 
analysis after stabilized course and positive JCV index. The patient was a smoker and had arterial hypertension. 
Concomitant medication included amlodipine.
The patient received Gilenya (fingolimod) capsule 0.5 mg for the treatment of relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis 
from 18 Mar 2015, at a dose of 0.5 mg, QD (oral). 
Cranial MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) performed on (b) (6)  revealed distinct barrier disturbance, 
extensive confluent and partly patchy lesion parts frontal and frontobasal including emphasis at right side but also 
at deep parts of white matter periventricular both sided. The PML (progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy) 
was suspected due to MRI on (b) (6)  The patient was hospitalized for the event. Treatment with Gilenya was 
temporarily interrupted since (b) (6)  After two weeks, in (b) (6)  Gilenya was restarted. Cranial MRI 
performed on (b) (6)  revealed progredient findings including slightly increase of lesion size and contrast 
enhancement. Regarding clinical features the physician stated that patient showed continuously no focal neurologic
deficits. Neuropsychologically, the patient showed only increased irritability without significant change to previous 
investigations. The JCV DNA PCR (polymerase chain reaction) tests performed on (b) (6) , (b) (6)  and 
(b) (6)  at (b) (6)  lab were negative. JCV antibody testing currently revealed a considerable increase of 
JCV antibodies in a period of about two weeks. On(b) (6)  and (b) (6)  the patient had ASI index of 7.31
and 10.3 respectively. This was a clearly increased value, also supporting suspicion of PML. At no point in time, the
patient had clinical symptoms. Treatment with Gilenya was finally discontinued on 09 Jun 2015. On 18 Jun 2015, 
JCV DNA PCR test performed at (b) (6)  lab (USA) was negative. 
The physician stated that suspicion of PML still existed despite negative JCV DNA PCR tests. Possible differential 
diagnosis according to physician was IRIS after severe MS relapse or as rebound phenomenon. However, final 
diagnosis was provided as "most likely PML or IRIS".
On an unknown date, hematological examinations (unspecified), EEG and brain biopsy was performed (results not

reported). As treatment measure of the event suspicion of PML, plasmapheresis was performed twice, five cycles 
each and received mirtazapine 60 mg daily.
Outcome was reported as ongoing as patient was still clinically stable without focal neurological deficits and also as 
improved (based on medical imaging). Causality was assessed as probable by physician. As alternative reason for 
the event the physician reported treatment with natalizumab 300 mg intravenously every four weeks (at overall 86 
administrations until 13 Jan 2015).
Follow up report received from a physician via pharmaceutical company Biogen (reference number: 2015BI080025)
on 29 Jun 2015: Added the patient birth year and updated the PML event seriousness.
Follow up report received from a physician on 19 Aug 2015: Removed patient ID, updated medical history, 
concomitant medication (amlodipine), investigations (JCV index, ASI index, JCV DNA test and MRI), therapy details
of Gilenya (indication, route, dosage regimen and action taken), changed event onset date (from (b) (6)  to (b)(6)  
(b) (6) ) and seriousness of event suspicion of PML, updated treatment details and causality of event suspicion of
PML, added new event (IRIS) and reporter comments.
