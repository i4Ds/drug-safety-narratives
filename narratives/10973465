Medically Significant
A neurologist spontaneously reported via a Biogen representative that a 60 year old female patient on TYSABRI 
(300 mg, IV, QM) for Multiple Sclerosis from Jul 2010 to 17 Feb 2015 experienced PML suspicion (onset unknown).
 The patient had difficulty moving the right arm (NOS). JCV serology (date not specified) was positive with an index 
value of 0.39. A brain MRI performed on 05 Feb 2015 showed no changes. A brain MRI performed on 17 Mar 2015 
showed hyperintense lesion in the left precentral gyrus which was greater in diffusion imaging and was suggestive 
of PML. A lumbar puncture was performed on 17 Mar 2015 (presumed for CSF JCV DNA testing) and the results 
were pending at the time of this report. Treatment for the event was not provided and the outcome for the event is 
unknown. Causality for the event of PML suspicion is unknown.  TYSABRI therapy was discontinued. French 
Imputability: C1S1I1.
Update 26 Mar 2015: The neurologist reported via a Biogen representative that the CSF JCV DNA (local) from 17 
Mar 2015 came back negative. No other information was provided. French Imputability: C1 S1 I1.
Update 09 Apr 2015: Additional information received from the neurologist via a Biogen representative reported that,
at this time, TYSABRI therapy was resumed, with the patient's most recent infusion on 07 Apr 2015. The patient 
has received 56 TYSABRI infusions. At the time of this report, only one JCV serology had been performed on 07 
Jun 2012 (index value 0.376; previously reported as 0.39). There was no plan for a new lumbar puncture for 
additional JCV PCR testing. The final diagnosis was neurological worsening related to the MS progression. This 
neurological worsening was only detected on the MRI (17 Mar 2015) by the radiologist. The neurologist did not find 
any motor disorder in the patient's right arm during clinical examination. This radiological event did not require a 
bolus of Solumedrol (methylprednisolone) or any other corrective treatment. Causality for the event of neurological 
worsening related to MS progression was not assessed by the neurologist. At the time of this report, the patient was
very well and TYSABRI therapy was ongoing. French Imputability: C1S1I1.
Update 16 Apr 2015: Upon internal review, Biogen has downgraded this case to low suspect for PML pending 
details of repeat MRI and clinical update. French Imputability: C1S1I1.
