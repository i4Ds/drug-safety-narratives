This Clinical Trial 11111111.1.1case, reported by a Study Investigator , concerns a 58 Years old Caucasian 
Male patient. Medical History: Mediastinoscopy (video assisted), Lung neoplasm malignant , Cholecystectomy , 
Gastrectomy , High frequency ablation , Pyloric stenosis , Gout , Hypercholesterolaemia , Peptic ulcer , Chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease , Hypertension , Tobacco user , Diabetes mellitus , Arrhythmia This patient was 
diagnosed with stage IV adenocarcinoma of the lung with extensive pleural involvement. He underwent a video 
assisted mediastinoscopy (VATS) on 14-Oct-2010 and mechanical and chemical pleurodesis was performed. On 
06-Dec-2010, the patient started carboptatin and celebrex as part of a double blinded clinical trial. He also received 
pemetrexed (start date unknown). The patient required repeat hospitalisations for increasing symptoms of chest 
discomfort, pain, and anxiety. On 17-Jan-2011, the patient demonstrated dramatic weight loss of 39 pounds from 
baseline, despite aggressive home health nursing services. He continued to struggle with pain and anxiety. The 
patient vasilated several times between hospice and treatment. However, a computerised tomogram (CT) of the 
chest obtained on 21-Jan-2011 showed loculated pleural fluid collections and a worsening of the right basal 
effusion with evidence of ascites. There was diffuse heterogeneous soft tissue density within the emonum. The 
patient was admitted to the hospital on complaining of nausea, vomiting, and dehydration. Adverse 
events were reported as follows: dyspnea grade since 19-Dec-2010, depression grade 2 sincsinceDec-2010, non-
small cell lung cancer since 14-Oct-2010, anorexia grade 3 since 17-Jan-2010, dehydration grade 2 from 19-Dec-
2010 to 19-Dec-2010, hypercalcemia grade 1 from 17-Jan-2010 to 30-Nov-2010, hyperkalemia grade 2 since 15-
Nov-2010, hypoalbuminemia grade 3 since 17-Nov-2010, pain grade 3 since 11-Nov-2010 and nausea grade 3 
since 17-Nov-2010. Laboratory tests were as follows: on 15-Nov-2010, blood glucose 144 mg/dl, potassium 6 
mEq/I, platelets 569,000 3/mm3, white blood cell count 160,000 3/mm3. On 17-Nov-2010, albumin was 3.1 g/dl. On 
03-Dec-2010 blood glucose was 253 mg/d1. On 27-Dec-2010, albumin was 1.7 g/dI. On 27-Jan-2011 albumin was 2 
g/d1, blood glucose was 181 mg/di, potassium was 5.5 mEq/l, platelet count was 898,000 3/mm3 and white blood 
cell count was 50,500 3/mm3. On the patient expressed his desire to discontinue aggressive 
treatment. The patient expired on secondary to grade 5 non-small cell lung cancer. It was unknown 
whether there was an autopsy. The fatal adverse event was grade 5 non-small cell lung cancer. The investigator 
considered that causality for lung cancer was unrelated for premetrexed, carboplatin, and celecoxib/placebo. The

investigator considered causality for anorexia grade 3, nausea grade 3, and dehydration grade 2 to be possibly 
related to celecoxib/placebo. The events of dyspnea grade 3, depression grade 2, pain grade 3, hypercalcemia 
grade 1, hyperkalemia grade 2, and hypoalbuminemia grade 3 were not related to celecoxib/placebo. The 
investigator considered there was a reasonable possibility that the events of anorexia grade 3 and dehydration 
grade 2 were related to pemetrexed and carboplatin. Causality for nausea grade 3 was definite for carboplatin and 
probable for pemetrexed. The investigator considered the events of dyspnea grade 3, depression grade 2, pain 
grade 3 to be unrelated to pemetrexed and carboplatin. Causality for hypercalcemia grade 1, hyperkalemia grade 2, 
and hypoalbuminemia grade 3 were reported as unlikely related to pemetrexed and carboplatin.
