AER 1539687 is a spontaneous literature case, received on 16/Feb/2015 and concerns a 55 year old male patient 
who developed progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), while being treated with rituximab, 
cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisone (R-CHOP ). 
Patient's medical history, concurrent illness, past drugs or concomitant medications were reported.
On an unspecified date, the patient started R-CHOP regimen for diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. After 8 cycles of R-
CHOP, his magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed multiple demyelination in anterior pontomesencephon 
region and the right thalamus and; he was diagnosed with PML. But, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test was not 
done on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). At the time of diagnosis of PML, his fluorodeoxyglucosepositron emission 
tomography (FDGPET/CT) showed the total remission of lymphoma.
There was insufficient information about the outcome of PML as well as therapy ongoing status of R-CHOP.
The authors described this case as PML in R-CHOP treated patient.
The company assessed PML as medically significant.
Additional information has been requested.
