Life Threatening, Medically Significant
An attending neurologist reported that a female patient on TYSABRI (unknown dose, unknown route, unknown 
frequency) for Multiple Sclerosis from unknown date to Sep 2014 was hospitalized from an unknown date to an 
unknown date for suspected PML characterized by comatose state (onset Sep 2014) and deterioration of condition 
(presume MS) (onset Sep 2014). The neurologist reported that the patient?s condition deteriorated to such an 
extent that the patient was hospitalized and has been in a comatose state for at least 2 weeks. PML is suspected 
but has not yet been confirmed. Neurologist has stopped the TYSABRI treatment.  The events of suspected PML 
characterized by comatose state and deterioration of condition (presume MS) are ongoing. The causality for the 
events of suspected PML characterized by comatose state and deterioration of condition (presume MS) was 
assessed as related.  TYSABRI therapy was discontinued.
Update 01 Oct 2014: Follow-up information was received from the physician.  The patient's gender was corrected to
be male.  On 06 Feb 2014, JCV testing was negative.  The patient received doses of TYSABRI on 28 Mar 2014, 25 
Apr 2014, 23 May 2014, 20 Jun 2014 and 18 Jul 2014.  In (b) (6)  the patient fell ill before this 6th dose and went 
to see his doctor. The patient suspected PML. He was admitted and various tests were done. JCV test was done 
on 14 Aug 2014 and result was negative. The doctor did various blood tests as well as a spinal tap while he was in 
hospital as well as a MRI. During the 3rd week in September another JCV test was done and result was positive.
As of 01 Oct 2014, the neurologist reported the patient was recovering.  Additional information is expected.
Update 02 Oct 2014: Follow-up information was received from the neurologist.  The patient was further identified as
53 years old.  The patient's current location was home.  The suspect product was confirmed as TYSABRI and the 
patient had not experienced an interruption of the suspect product for greater than three months. The patient had 
not received any prior immunosuppressant therapy.  The patient was being evaluated for PML due to signs and 
symptoms, including decreased vision in the right eye (onset 11 Aug 2014).
The patient underwent MRI, prior to the suspected PML diagnosis, on 28 Mar 2014.  The patient underwent MRI, at
the time of suspected PML diagnosis, on 12 Aug 2014.  Lumbar puncture was performed on 13 Aug 2014.  Testing 
for JCV DNA was performed by the (b) (6)  laboratory and results were negative.  CSF analysis was also 
performed.  Brain biopsy was not performed.  At the time of PML suspicion, on 13 Aug 2014, leukocyte count was 
3.86 x10^9/l (normal range 4-12), lymphocyte count was 1.69 x10^9/l (normal range 1-4), and absolute lymphocyte 
count was 43.8%.  Additionally, the patient was noted to have abnormal liver enzymes.  Laboratory testing showed 
gamma glutamyl transferase was 257 IU/L (normal range 0-64), ALT was 133 IU/L (normal range, <40), and AST 
was 49 IU/L (normal range 15-40).  On 13 Aug 2014, the patient was noted to have a microcytic hypochromic 
anemia.  The patient received treatment for PML with SoluMedrol (methylprednisolone) 1000mg, IV, daily from 14 
Aug 2014 to 16 Aug 2014.  No treatment with plasma exchange or immunoadsorption was performed.  On 18 Aug

FOIA Case Report Information
2014, the microcytic hypochromic anemia was noted to be persisting as well as thrombocytopenia.
Update 13 Nov 2014: Biogen Idec no longer considers this case to be suspect for PML based on negative CSF, 
inconsistent MRI, and final diagnosis of coma and right eye vision change.
Update 20 Nov 2014: Follow-up information was received from the neurologist.  JC Virus antibody test prior to 
starting TYASABRI was negative.  After the 5th injection [infusion] the patient got ill with loss of vision in the eye 
[presume previously reported right eye vision change], confusion and hallucinations.  PCR Antigen test came back 
negative and blood test showed the antibodies (JCV) positive.  TYSABRI was discontinued.  The patient and family 
declined further testing and the patient was treated with steroids.  After a month, the confusion improved although 
his vision never returned.  On 21 Nov 2014, the outcome was assessed as recovering.  The neurologist's final 
diagnosis was probable PML.
Update 07 Dec 2014: Follow-up information was received from the neurologist.  The neurologist spoke with the 
patient via telephone and learned that he has not fully recovered, but there has been an improvement since his 
discharge. His vision has not recovered (presume previously reported right eye vision change).  Review of MRI 
images, taken while in hospital, showed an increase in the white matter lesions in the frontal areas.  The 
neurologist's clinical rationale for thinking that this was PML was the patient's clinical symptoms, a deterioration in 
his vision associated with a confused mental state (previously reported confusion) that had progressed over a two-
three week period.  The patient was treated with pulse dose steroids for 5 days without improvement.  Plasma 
exchange was suggested, however, the family declined.  After the patient left the hospital, the neurologist was 
asked to not contact the patient for any further investigations.
Update 18 Dec 2014: Biogen Idec considers this case low suspect and final call for PML based on presence of 
clinical symptoms, negative CSF and patient lost to follow up. No additional clinical data is expected as patient has 
refused follow up.
