Life Threatening
A medical doctor spontaneously reported that an adult patient on TYSABRI (unknown dose, IV, unknown 
frequency) for an unknown indication from unknown date to unknown date experienced suspect PML (onset 
unknown) and speech disorder (onset unknown). No treatment or testing was reported. The outcome for the events
suspect PML and speech disorder is unknown. The causality for the events of suspect PML and speech disorder is 
unknown.  It is unknown if TYSABRI treatment is ongoing.
Update 20 Jan 2015: Follow-up information was received from a physician.  The patient was further identified as a 
36 year old male.  TYSABRI (300 mg, IV, QM), for multiple sclerosis, was administered from Nov 2012 to Nov 
2014.  Suspect PML onset was 05 Jan 2015 and was considered life-threatening.  Treatment included 
corticosteroids and plasma exchange therapy.  PML suspicion is continuing.  TYSABRI therapy was stopped.

Update 20 Jan 2015: Follow-up information was received from the treating physician via a suspect PML Data 
Collection Form. MS was diagnosed in 2006; symptoms included weakness on arms and legs (onset Nov 2012), 
dysarthria (onset Nov 2012), ataxia (onset Nov 2012), and bilateral vision loss (onset Nov 2014). Prior 
immunosuppressant therapy included azathioprine (Apr 2010 - Sep 2012). Prior immunomodulatory therapy 
included Betaseron (interferon beta-1b; 2006-2010). CBC pre-TYSABRI was performed on 10 Nov 2012 (results 
not provided). TYSABRI was started Nov 2012 and stopped Nov 2014. The patient did not experience an 
interruption of TYSABRI therapy for greater than 3 months. MRI prior to PML diagnosis was performed on 30 Nov 
2014. The presenting signs and symptoms which lead to the evaluation for possible PML included quadriparesis 
and speech disorder (onsets (b) (6) ), and dysphagia (onset unknown). MRI at the time of PML diagnosis was 
performed on (b) (6)  Lumbar puncture was performed on (b) (6)  (results from local lab and (b) (6)  are
pending).  Brain biopsy has not been performed.  The patient tested positive for serum anti-JCV antibodies on 05 
Nov 2013 ((b) (6) ). CBC pre-PLEX was performed on 21 Jan 2015 (results not provided). The patient received 
corticosteroids (prednisolone) since 19 Jan 2015 and five sessions of plasma exchange ((b) (6)
). The patient was currently hospitalized. The outcome is unknown. PML is still under investigation and has 
been assessed as related to TYSABRI.
Update 29 Jan 2015: Follow-up information indicated the laboratory test (CSF JCV DNA) was positive from the 
local laboratory with result of 384,000 copies/ml.
Update 04 Feb 2015: Additional information was received. MRI scans from (b) (6)  and 30 Nov 2014 were 
provided on CD. MRI reports were not provided.
Update 12 Feb 2015: Biogen Idec considers this case confirmed for PML based on positive CSF, consistent 
radiological findings, and clinical symptoms.
Update 01 Apr 2015: Follow-up information received indicated that the patient died on (b) (6)  (no cause of 
death was reported but presumed PML was the cause of death). No further information was provided.
Update 13 Apr 2015: Additional information was received from a physician via a Standardized MS PML Data 
Collection Tool. The following test results from 14 May 2012 (prior to starting TYSABRI) were reported: leukocyte 
count 5900 (normal range 4600 - 10200); lymphocyte count 1500 (normal range 1000-1800). The patient had a 
negative HIV result on 15 May 2012. The patient?s estimated Karnofsky and EDSS scores on 10 Oct 2012 were 80
(normal activity with effort; some signs or symptoms of disease) and 3, respectively. The following test results from 
26 Sep 2013 (on TYSABRI prior to PML) were reported: leukocyte count 10000 (normal range 4600 - 10200); 
lymphocyte count 4820 (normal range 600 - 3600). Serum anti-JCV antibody status was positive on 05 Nov 2013. 
The patient?s estimated Karnofsky and EDSS scores on 05 Nov 2013 were 70 (cares for self; unable to carry on

normal activity or to do active work) and 4.5. MRI was performed prior to PML diagnosis on 30 Nov 2014 (results 
not reported). On (b) (6) , a lumbar puncture was performed (previously reported), MRI was performed (at 
time of PML diagnosis; results not provided), and the patient?s estimated Karnofsky score was 40 (disabled; 
requires special care and assistance). EDSS on (b) (6)  was reported as 12 (sic). The following test results 
from (b) (6)  (pre-PLEX) were reported: leukocyte count 15690 (normal range 4230 - 9070); lymphocyte count
1560 (normal range 1320 - 3570). The patient was not diagnosed with IRIS. At the time of death ((b) (6) ), the 
patient had not recovered from PML. No autopsy was performed and the event of PML and the patient's death were
assessed to be related to TYSABRI.
