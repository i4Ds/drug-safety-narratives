This clinical trial case (H8K-MC-JZAE) concerns a 77-year-old Caucasian female. Medical history included stage 
MC, poorly differentiated ovarian cancer status post optimal cytoreduction on 10Apr07, type 2 diabetes mellitus 
controlled on metformin for aximately 10 years with blood sugars in the 120,to 140 range, hypertension, 
gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERO), multiple drug allergies (available in source document), cholecystectomy, 
reactive airway disease, hypercholesterolernia and neuropathy. Previous chemotherapy regimen included 
paclitaxel and carbootatin for six cycles completed in Aug07 and six cycles of doxorubicin hydrochloride, initiated on 
31May08, without response. Family history included her father who died at age 49 with a cerebral hemorrhage and 
one brother with kidney cancer. She received multiple concomitant medications including metformin, folic acid, 
cyanocobalernin and dexamethasone (initiated on 27Jul08 and last received on 31Jul08). The patient first received 
0'573636 1769 mg intravenously (IV) on day 1, cycle 1 only, and pemetrexed 500 rng/m2 IV on day 1 of 21-day 
cycle beginning on 28Jul08 for the indication of platinum-resistant ovarian cancer. She received dexamethasone 
as an antiemetic (dosage not specified) one day prior to receiving cycle 1 and four days later. Her glucose was 
about 345 when cycle one was administered (initial increase was attributed to dexamethasone administration). 
Four days after receiving cycle one, date not provided, she began to experience fatigue, rnyalgias, nausea and

receivigetudytherapy, she presented to the clinic for an unscheduled visit. She reported that she had done wail 
until the:evening of 01Aug08 when she started having fatigue. She got upin the middle of the night and felt when 
she was trying to void. She had no loss of consciousness. At thatpoint, she was having significant pain in her 
buttocks, legs and lower abdomen, similar to paracetamol m M0.s. She brad nottaken any pain medicines for this. 
She also frit quite weak and had trouble gettingpp off. the floor. The next day (day six), she slept all: day and did 
not take her metformin, which she usually takes twice daily. The following day she took her evening dose only, as 
she spent most of the day sleeping on the couch. During that time she was never hypoglycemic with blood sugars 
in the high 100s and low 200s. She also noted a sore on her lip, nasal muccsa and the tip of her nose. They were 
similar to cold sores she had in the past. Shehad a.decreased appetite, but no nausea or vomiting. On evaluation 
in the clinic, she was  .-    Oho hyperglycemic e of 521 (at that time 0: 0 t tobe relatedtohaving

returned to the anic on inim,imidays after last receiving study therapy, as she had persistent hyperglycemia 
and complaints of weakness withb ,  sl   between 300-5  0.0,  compliant withmetformin. On the clay prior to 
admission, she did.have some vomiting and diarrhea for which the took  -00.-     hydrochloride. She was found 
to have grade 4 hyperglycemia (glucose An which was unexpected given that she was previously wellcontrolled 
and hadtaken all of her met . as pr o    0  since the evening of 03Aug08. She was treated with one liter of 
normal saline and 12 units of r insulin and her blood sugar was still greater than 500. She received an

for hydration, insulin and close monitoring. Additional diagnoses included grade 4 neutropenia and grade 4

She was seen by the team who felt that her hyperglycemia may have been related to the study drugs as 
they could not nd another explanation for this event other than the generalized illness/stress. She required more

rats was controlled with propranolol hydrochloride, digoxin and diuresis. Following diuresis on Mil she began 
to have episodes of hypovolemia with blood pressures 70-80s/40s-50s. She was given gentle IV fluid boluses of 
250 cc OW7'41 saline.  6  '   ver, following the boluses, she would develop pulmonary edema with significant airway 
secretions. She was seen by pulmonary consultant who felt the etiology for her dyspnea could include cardiac 
asthma in the setting of volume overload and diastolic heart failure (although EiNF. was down and creatinine was up 
on admission) in conjunction with bronchitis with bronchial constriction/reactive airways. There was no evidence of 
pneumonia or metastatic disease. In the early morning of 111.110, labs revealed pH of 7.17, hemoglobin 9.7 gicIL

the  '  .'m  of the study investigator, the events of hyperglycemia, hypotension, leukopenia (expected), neutropenia 
(ex.pecltiod), ;  -   0: and hypoalbuminernie were possibly related to LY573638 and pemetrexed. In 
reference to hypoalbunernia, there was no change in her cancer and she was not cachectic, nor was she septic. 
None of the proposed explanations were applicable in this instance; possibly related to study drug. The cause of 
her hyperglycemia was unclear. Medication effect must be considered. Her missed doses of metformin could 
certainly cause hyperglycemia. Dexamethasone would be a likely candidate for her hyperglycemia, but the most 
profound hyperglycemia came several days after (six days) her last dose of this steroid; no concurrent illness or 
other reasonable cause. Pemetrexed is not known to be associated with hyperglycemia. Little information is 
available regarding LY573636. The putative mechanism of action is to induce mitochondrial-mediated apoptosis 
and its elimination of half-life is 340 hours and hyperglycemia has not been reported previously. The events of 
hypoxia and cardiac arrest with the outcome of death were possibly related to LY573638 and pernetrexed. None of
