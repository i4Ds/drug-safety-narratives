Medically Significant
A neurologist reported via a Biogen Idec Area Business Manager (ABM) that a patient (age and gender unknown), 
on TYSABRI (300 mg, IV, QM) for Multiple Sclerosis for over 2 years (exact start date unknown), is being evaluated
for suspected PML (onset Feb 2014) based on a very atypical lesion seen on MRI (test date unknown). Initial date 
of diagnosis of Multiple Sclerosis was not reported. The patient is JCV antibody positive and anti-natalizumab 
antibody negative (test dates unknown). CSF will be collected to test for JC PCR and BK PCR. Testing will be 
performed locally. Medical history, concomitant tests, and prior immunosuppressant and immunomodulator 
therapies are unknown. The total number of TYSABRI infusions received at the time of the event is unknown. The 
outcome of the event, suspected PML, is unknown. Causality was reported as unknown. TYSABRI therapy was 
discontinued in Feb 2014.

FOIA Case Report Information
Update 06 Mar 2014 and 07 Mar 2014: Additional information was received from the neurologist who reported CSF 
JCV tested positive. The test date and specific test findings were not provided. The patient is currently well. The 
surveillance scan found a pre-symptomatic atypical subcortical parietal lesion in a stable patient.
Update 07 Mar 2014 (second update): Additional information was received from a different physician who identified 
the patient as a 35 year old male, on TYSABRI (300 mg, IV, QM) without interruption from 06 Sep 2011 to 18 Feb 
2014. The patient experienced a "clinically isolated syndrome" in Jun 2011, and then experienced his first relapse 
[MS] 6 weeks later at which time he was formally diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis (approximate date of initial 
diagnosis: Jul 2011). Both episodes were treated with steroids (NOS) prior to initiation of natalizumab. No other 
immunotherapy was administered. PML risk factors include JCV antibody positive in Feb 2012; index value was 
unknown. It was noted that the patient was asymptomatic. MRI brain on 30 Oct 2013, performed for PML 
surveillance, compared to the prior MRI on 04 Jul 2013 indicated progression of Multiple Sclerosis with new non-
enhancing supratentorial lesions; no enhancing supratentorial lesion was identified; infratentorially, a new left 
cerebellum white matter lesion was identified with enlargement of previous left cerebellum white matter lesion; 
remaining infratentorial lesions were stable; no enhancing infratentorial lesion was seen. MRI brain and whole spine
on 25 Feb 2014 indicated interval progressive MS plaques in the supra and infratentorial brain with increased T2 
signal in the subcortical U fibres right frontal lobe towards the vertex demonstrating post contrast enhancement; 
increased T2 signal focus at the margin of the right thalamus and internal capsule; the supratentorial lesions 
demonstrated post contrast enhancement consistent with active plaques; extensive spinal cord lesions remained 
stable. The case was discussed at a neurology meeting on 28 Feb 2014 in the presence of the neurologist and note
was made of the evolving large and enhancing right frontal lesion of confluent hyperintense T2 signal involving the 
superior and middle frontal gyri. The possibility of PML was considered based on the results of the 25 Feb 2014 
MRI. A lumbar puncture was performed on 04 Mar 2014 which was JC virus positive (<30 copies/mL). Mirtazapine 
was planned as treatment scheduled to start on 07 Mar 2014; the patient is currently an outpatient. TYSABRI 
therapy was discontinued (last dose: 18 Feb 2014).
Update 18 Mar 2014: Upon internal review, Biogen Idec considers this case to be confirmed for PML based on the 
positive CSF and MRI findings.
Update 27 Mar 2014: Additional information was provided by the neurologist who provided the second update on 07
Mar 2014. A copy of the CSF JCV report from the local lab was received which indicated that JCV DNA was 
detected.
Update 16 Apr 2014: Additional information was received from the neurologist via a MS Standardized PML Data 
Collection Tool and diagnostic report. The patient tested negative for HIV on 24 Jun 2011. Prior to starting 
TYSABRI, the patient?s estimated Karnofsky score was assessed on an unspecified date to be approximately 80

(able to carry on normal activity; minor signs or symptoms of disease). While on TYSABRI and prior to PML 
diagnosis, estimated EDSS score was assessed on 01 Jul 2013 to be 2 and Karnofsky score assessed on 25 Nov 
2013 was 70 (cares for self; unable to carry on normal activity or to do active work). At the time of PML diagnosis, 
Karnofsky score assessed on 26 Feb 2014 was 70 and EDSS assessed on 04 Mar 2014 was 3. The patient was 
negative for anti-natalizumab antibodies on 30 Oct 2013. An MRI was performed on 30 Oct 2013 and on 21 Feb 
2014 (previously reported). No additional lumbar punctures have been performed since 04 Mar 2014. The patient is
currently residing at home. The outcome of the event of PML was not specified but it was noted that the patient 
remains asymptomatic. Causality for the event was assessed as related to TYSABRI.
Update 16 May 2014: The treating neurologist reported via e-mail that the patient has deteriorated rapidly both 
clinically and via MRI within the last 3 to 4 days after 3 months of clinical stability. The neurologist reported that the 
patient possibly has IRIS (onset unknown).  He stated that TYSBARI was discontinued in mid Feb 2014 after 
routine MRI disclosed an atypical lesion. The patient did not receive plasma exchange or immunoadsorption and 
has been "very well", off all treatment, until late last week. Initial CSF demonstrated JCV PCR positive on an 
unknown date, but the copy number was below the limit of quantitation. A repeat CSF was performed approximately
10 days ago during a period of clinical stability.  The results indicated no change with a result of the patient JCV 
PCR positive with the copy number below the limit of quantitation.  Due to the rapidity of decline the neurologist 
stated that he has instituted treatment as per IRIS. The patient has a severe neurologic deficit currently. The patient
is being considered for biopsy.  The outcome and causality for the event of possible IRIS was unknown.  No 
additional information was reported.
Update 16 Sep 2014: Additional information was received from the neurologist via a MS Standardized PML Data 
Collection Tool and diagnostic reports. The patient is alive, residing at home, and is not currently on any MS 
therapy. The physician assessed the patient?s estimated Karnofsky and EDSS scores on 27 Aug 2014 to be 70 
(cares for self; unable to carry on normal activity or to do active work) and 3.5, respectively. An MRI of the brain and
spine was performed on 27 Aug 2014 with results reported as follows: reduced enhancement of the left frontal and 
right occipitotemporal lesions without evidence of new lesions suggesting improvement. Stable spinal cord lesions. 
Generalized spinal and also intracranial smooth dural enhancement. Relevant labs from 27 Aug 2014 were 
reported as follows: leukocyte count 16.1 x 10(9)/L (normal range 4-11); absolute lymphocyte count 0.95 x10(9)/L 
(normal range 1.5-3.5); and neutrophils 14.78 x 10(9)/L (normal range 1.80-7.50). The patient was diagnosed with 
IRIS, determined by clinical symptoms, MRI findings, and brain biopsy (results not provided). The onset date of 
IRIS symptoms was 15 May 2014 and included confusion and depression (cognitive/ behavioral), left upper and 
lower limb pyramidal pattern weakness (multifocal motor), dysarthria (speech), ophthalmoplegia (visual), and left 
sided ataxia (cerebellar). The patient did not receive corticosteroids prior to onset of IRIS. Post-IRIS onset, he 
received methylprednisolone 1 gram IV daily from 15 May to 19 May 2014 and tapered prednisolone as follows: 60 
mg PO daily from 20 May to 29 May 2014; 50 mg PO daily from 30 May to 10 Jun 2014; 40 mg PO daily from 20

Jun to 27 Aug 2014; and 35 mg PO daily from 28 Aug 2014 to present. The patient has recovered from PML and 
IRIS. Causality for the events was assessed as related to TYSABRI.
Update 28 Apr 2015: Additional information was received from the physician via a Standardized MS PML Data 
Collection Tool. The patient is alive. The physician assessed the patient?s estimated Karnofsky and EDSS scores 
on 22 Apr 2015 to be 70 (cares for self; unable to carry on normal activity or to do active work) and 3.5, 
respectively. MRI of the brain and spine was performed on 04 Mar 2015 with results reported as follows: overall 
stable supratentorial disease compatible with a combination of primary demyelination and PML-IRIS. Extensive 
cord lesions are also unchanged. At the time of this report, the patient has recovered from PML and IRIS. Causality
for the events of PML and IRIS was assessed as related to TYSABRI.
Update 10 May 2015: Additional information was received from the physician via a Standardized MS PML Data 
Collection Tool. The patient is currently at home. The physician reported the most recent MRI was done on 04 Mar 
2015, details previously reported.  The patient is currently receiving Avonex therapy for Multiple Sclerosis; the 
reason for starting Avonex therapy was reported as preventative.
