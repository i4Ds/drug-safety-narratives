Case number# PHHY2015IT015906, is an initial literature case report received on 09 Feb 2015. The author 
discussed about progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) following treatment with rituximab in an HIV-
negative patient with Non-Hodgkin lymphoma. This report refers to a 54-year-old female patient. Medical history 
was not reported. Concomitant medication was not reported. On an unknown date, she started R-CHOP 
chemotherapy (rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, Oncovin (vincristine) and prednisolone) (unknown 
manufacturer, formulation, dose, route of administration and duration) for follicular non-Hodgkin lymphoma. She 
started to notice gradual progressive neurological symptoms about two months after completion of rituximab 
treatment and was therefore admitted to hospital. On admission, brain CT and MRI showed widespread lesions 
consistent with a demyelinating process involving the subcortical and deep white matter of the cerebral and 
cerebellar hemispheres. CT and MRI findings were suggestive of PML, and JC virus DNA was detected by 
polymerase chain reaction assay of the cerebrospinal fluid and serum. The patient was treated supportively but 
reported a progressive worsening of the clinical and radiological findings. Action taken with the suspect drugs was 
not reported. Final event outcome was not reported. The author commented that this report emphasizes the role of 
CT and MRI findings in the diagnosis of PML and suggests that PML should be considered in patients with 
progressive neurological disorders involving the entire nervous system and mainly the white matter, especially in 
the presence of previous immunomodulatory treatment or immunosuppression. Case processed with an abstract 
and full text article has been ordered.
