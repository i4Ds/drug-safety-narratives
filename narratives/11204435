Reference number 2015AP008002 is a spontaneous report received from GSK on 06-Apr-2015 with an IRD of 29-
Jan-2015. The case was originally received from a lawyer, pertaining to a male neonate patient, who was exposed 
to Paxil (paroxetine) in utero and experienced premature delivery, congenital atrial septal defect, foramen ovale 
patent, coronary artery fistula, congenital anomaly, tricuspid valve regurgitation, pulmonary valve regurgitation, 
apnea, bradycardia, jaundice, hyperbillirubinameia, dehydration, hypovolemic shock, dizziness, sinus tachycardia 
and congenital heart murmur.
Linked to mother case Reference Number 2015AP008178.
Medical history included loose stools. Concomitant medication included prenatal vitamins, Iron, Covera (Verapamil 
hydrochloride) and Meclizine. Maternal concurrent conditions included hypertension, oligohydraminos, depression, 
anxiety, caesarean section in 2000, toxaemia in 2000, and allergy to penicillin and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory 
drugs. Family history included diabetes, thyroid disorder and heart diseases (unspecified). 
From an unknown date, the patient was exposed in utero to Paxil 20mg and 10mg (paroxetine 
hydrochloride),(DRUG EXPOSURE IN UTERO) which the mother was taking for of depression and anxiety. On (b) 
(b) (6) (6)
, the patient was born at 36 and one half weeks via caesarean section, weighing six pounds and one 
ounce. 
On 04 Sept 2001, an echocardiogram showed mild to moderate increase in right ventricular pressures, moderate 
tricuspid regurgitation (TRICUSPID REGURGITATION), trivial pulmonary insufficiency and small atrial septal 
defect/patent foramen ovale with left to right flow (CONGENITAL ATRIAL SEPTAL DEFECT). The patient was 
hospitalized from (b) (b) (6)(6)  to  with apnea (APNEA), bradycardia (BRADYCARDIA), prematurity (PREMATURITY) and jaundice (JAUNDICE NEONATAL). It was also noted that the patient had been previously 
admitted from apnoea and bradycardia and discharged on (b) (6) . On the latest admission, the patient did

not have any further episodes of cyanosis or apnea. On 07 November 2006, the patient was seen in cardiac 
consultation due to a heart murmur (CARDIAC MURMUR). He was again hospitalized at the age of 3 for diagnosis 
of hyperbilirubinemia (HYPERBILIRUBINEMIA), dehydration (DEHYDRTION) and hypovolemic shock 
(HYPOVOLEMIC SHOCK). The patient had occasional dizzy episodes (DIZZY) but no syncope. An 
echocardiogram showed normal biventricular systolic function, there was no patent foramen ovale or atrial septal 
defect noted but a tiny possible coronary artery to pulmonary fistula (CORONARY ARTERY FISTULA) was noted 
which didn't appear to be hemodynamically significant. The patients occasional heart racing when he was playing 
hard was suggestive of sinus tachycardia (SINUS TACHYCARDIA) and not a pathological tachycardia. On an 
unknown date the patient was diagnosed with pulmonary valve regurgitation (PULMONARY VALVE 
REGURGITATION) and congenital anomaly (CONGENITAL ANOMALY).
Laboratory data on (b) (6)  included: TEST: HEENT RESULT: Fontalle that was soft and flat. Bilateral red 
reflex noted in both eyes. The tongue was pink and moist TEST: Physical examination RESULT: The extremities 
were cool and pink with smooth and random movement. The skin was jaundiced to the chest without rashes. The 
skin turgor was somewhat decrease and the baby were noted to have a decreased subcutaneous fat in the 
extremities TEST: Abdomen RESULT: Abdomen was soft and bowel sounds were noted TEST: White count

The action taken with Paxil was not applicable. The patient recovered from the ASD and apnea and had not 
recovered from fistula, congenital anomaly, and heart murmur and drug exposure at the time of report. The 
outcomes of the remaining events were unknown..
