A physician assistant at the neurologist's office spontaneously reported via a Biogen Idec employee (medical 
science clinical liaison) that a 38 year old female patient on TYSABRI (300 mg, IV, QM) for Multiple Sclerosis from 
12 Nov 2012 to 29 Aug 2014 experienced suspect PML (onset 08 Jan 2015).  At the time of this report the TOUCH 
database indicated that the patient received a total of 19 doses of TYSABRI from 12 Nov 2012 to 29 Aug 2014.
Internal databases indicated the following:  MS onset was in 1999, prior therapy included Rebif (interferon beta-1a). 
No prior immunosuppressant therapy, no previous malignancy, no known HIV or HIV related risk factors were 
reported (physician assistant will confirm no prior history of malignancy and HIV related risk factors with patient). 
The patient persistently tested JCV antibody positive and again in Aug 2014.   The patient started TECFIDERA in 
Nov 2014 with very slow increase to standard dose of 240 [mg] BID for just few weeks now.  Lymph (presume 
lymphocyte count) prior to starting TECFIDERA therapy was 5.2.  The patient is enrolled in (b) (6)
with baseline ataxia, right foot drop, and ambulation with cane.  Clinically, the patient had been experiencing 
worsening ataxia, leg weakness and paresthesias for the past 2 weeks.  The patient was seen in the clinic on 22 
Jan [2015] and was started on 3 days of steroids (NOS).  The patient reported marked improvement with steroids.

A brain MRI performed on 23 Jan 2015 showed enhancing pons lesion and new lesion (since last scan in May 
2014) in the right posterior frontal subcortical lobe with white and gray matter involvement; it was a non-enhancing 
lesion about 13mm.  The physician assistant thinks the enhancing pons lesion is a MS lesion and that's the reason 
why the patient responded to steroids, however, the concern is regarding the frontal lobe lesion which may be PML.
 The patient was being seen today (presume 28 Jan 2015) for LP and repeat brain MRI.  Lymph, CD4 CD8 counts, 
and JCV antibody testing will be repeated.  The outcome for the event suspect PML is unknown. The causality for 
the event of suspect PML was assessed as related.  According to the physician assistant, PML was suspected in 
the setting of patient's prior TYSABRI exposure, unrelated to TECFIDERA.  TYSABRI therapy was discontinued. 
Update 02 Feb 2015:  Upon follow-up, the physician assistant reported that JCV PCR results were not back yet but 
CSF showed mildly elevated protein and WBC.
Update 03 Feb 2015:  Upon follow-up, the physician assistant reported that the patient was being admitted to the 
hospital (b) (6)  At the time of this report, CSF results were not back yet. 
Update 03 Feb 2015:  Upon follow-up, the physician assistant reported that CSF [JCV DNA] from (b) (6)  lab was 
negative and results from (b) (6)  have not been received.
Update 06 Feb 2015:  Upon follow-up, the physician assistant confirmed that CSF JCV DNA result from (b) (6)  lab 
was ultrasensitive to 50 copies.  [CSF JCV DNA] results from(b) (6)  also came back negative.  Repeat MRI (presume
in reference to the one performed on 28 Jan 2015) showed some new enhancement of the concerning pontine 
lesion.
Update 05 Feb 2015:  A registered nurse from the neurologist's office reported via a Biogen Idec Employee that the
female patient was admitted today (presume (b) (6) ) to receive plasmapheresis treatment for suspected 
PML. The patient stopped taking TYSABRI in Aug 2014 and started taking TECFIDERA in Nov 2014. No additional 
information was provided.
Addendum to 05 Feb 2015 update:  Upon internal review, serious criteria for the event suspect PML has been 
updated to hospitalization as the patient was admitted on (b) (6)  to receive plasmapheresis.  The event of 
suspect PML is ongoing. TYSABRI was discontinued on 25 Aug 2014 (date discrepant).  Additionally, the patient 
started TECFIDERA (240mg, PO, BID) on either 04 Nov 2014 or 05 Nov 2014 (discrepant dates provided; no 
information provided regarding 120 mg dosing).
Update 17 Feb 2015:  Upon follow-up, the physician assistant reported that the patient continues to do well.  Plan is
to repeat MRI and LP this week.

Update 20 Feb 2015:  The physician assistant reported via a Biogen Idec employee (regional sales director) that 
the female patient on TYSABRI for 18 months from Mar 2013 (date discrepant) to Aug 2014 had tested JCV 
(presume antibody) positive in Aug 2014 (previously reported). TYSABRI therapy was permanently discontinued, 
TECFIDERA titration dose was started in Aug 2014 (date discrepant), and the patient developed PML (onset 2015, 
previously reported as 08 Jan 2015).  It is unknown if TECFIDERA treatment is ongoing (previously reported as 
ongoing).
Update 22 Feb 2015:  The physician assistant reported via a Biogen Idec Employee (Medical Science Liaison) that 
the patient did not end up being admitted to the hospital. CSF JCV PCR was negative (date unknown). Repeated 
[MR] imaging looked fairly stable (date unknown). The plan was to repeat [MR] imaging and JCV PCR next week. 
Clinically, the patient was doing well; acute symptoms have improved.
Update 24 Mar 2015:  Upon follow-up, the physician assistant reported that the patient was doing well clinically. The
patient still experienced some diplopia but otherwise had returned to her baseline in terms of gait and balance. A 
total of five MRIs have been performed since Jan [2015].  Results of the MRIs were summarized as follows:  on 23 
Jan 2015: there were multiple enhancing lesions in supratentorial brain, corpus callosum, left pons and non-
enhancing left frontal lesion concerning for PML (result previously reported); on 28 Jan 2015: stable imaging was 
noted (result previously reported); on (b) (6)  stable imaging except for new ring enhancement of left pontine 
lesions; on 20 Feb 2015: stable, continued enhancement of pontine lesion; and on 09 Mar 2015: left frontal lesion 
appeared smaller with resolution of left pontine lesion enhancement and new enhancing bilateral temporal lesions.
The patient decided not to complete second round of CSF testing.  The patient received Solumedrol 
(methylprednisolone) immediately following first MRI and has not received further therapy given good clinical 
presentation and stable/improving imaging. TECFIDERA was stopped in Jan [2015]. The decision was made to 
restart Copaxone (glatiramer) at her appointment on 10 Mar 2015.
Update 09 Apr 2015:  Upon an outbound call to the neurologist's office, the physician assistant reported that the 
patient is at home and doing fine.  MRI (date unknown) had improved.  The physician assistant indicated that 
perhaps this was indolent PML that was caught and was now resolving as a definite improvement in the lesion size 
was noted.  At the time of this report, PML had not been excluded and there are no plans to repeat LP or to perform
a brain biopsy.  The patient had restarted Copaxone (glatiramer) and was stable.
Update 16 Apr 2015:  Upon internal review, this case has been downgraded to low suspect and final call for PML 
based on radiographic improvement, and clincal stability  as MD did not exclude PML and considers it as indolent 
PML. This case will be closed and no additional follow-up is expected.
