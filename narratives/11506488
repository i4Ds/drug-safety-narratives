treated with rituximab (Mabthera) and bendamustine.
No concomitant medications, past drug or concurrent conditions were reported. It was unknown whether or not the 
patient had immunodeficiency, chronic viral infection, herpes zoster, herpes simplex or any opportunistic infections

In /Mar/2006, patient was diagnosed with chronic lymphatic leukaemia. In /Mar/2008, the patient started 3 cycles 
with bendamustine 90 mg/m2 for chronic lymphatic leukaemia. In /Jan/2009, the patient started 4 cycles with 
intravenous rituximab at the dose of 375 mg/m2. In /Mar/2011, she had stopped bendamustine. On 01/Aug/2011, 
patient underwent brain biopsy which shown encephalitis and JC-virus detectable. On 04/Aug/2011, she

leukoencephalopathy led to hospitalization with symptoms weakness, aphasia and disturbance of gait. It was 
unknown whether or not a brain MRI prior to the event was performed. On an unspecified date, her JC virus in CSF
not detectable. In /Sep/2011, CD20 was 2560/micmol, IGG was 3.6 g/l, CD8 571/ micmol, CD4 86/ micmol, ANC 
(absolute neutrophils count) 9030/ micmol and white blood cell count 12900/ micmol (normal values not). On
