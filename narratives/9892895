MEDICALLY SIGNIFICANT
A neurologist from a practice reported that a 47-year-old male patient on TYSABRI (natalizumab, 300 mg, IV, 
unknown frequency) for relapsing-remitting Multiple Sclerosis (RRMS) from 25 Aug 2006 to 16 Jan 2014 was 
admitted to the hospital on (b) (6)  for suspicion of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML). The 
neurologist provided a doctor?s letter with the following information: The patient, who had RRMS since 1996, had 
previously been treated with Avonex (interferon beta-1a). Since on TYSABRI, the patient?s MS stabilized and even 
his expanded disability status scale (EDSS) had improved from 3.5 to 2.5. Further medical history included bilateral 
hip dysplasia, which compromises the patient?s walking ability. Concomitant medication comprised Fampyra 
(fampridine, 10 mg, BID) since 05 Oct 2011. In Nov 2013, the patient was tested for L-selectin (CD62L+ CD4+ T-
cells), the result was highly normal. On anamnesis, the patient reported about mild dizziness in the first week of Jan

2014, which he had treated on his own with cortisone (PO). On (b) (6)  a routine MRI revealed an extensive 
hyperintense lesion in the right cerebellar peduncle in T2-weighted sequences which was slightly contrast 
enhancing. This finding was assessed as being atypical for MS and suspicious for PML. The event of suspicion of 
PML was ongoing at the time of this report. The causality for the event of suspicion of progressive multifocal 
leukoencephalopathy was assessed as related. 
Update 04 Feb 2014 (later on): A company field force was informed by a company sales representative that JCV 
PCR had revealed a positive result. 
Update 06 Feb 2014: The company field force provided additional information obtained from the neurological 
practice: The neurologist confirmed that JCV PCR in cerebrospinal fluid was positive, however the laboratory where
the test had been performed was unknown to him. Due to positive JCV PCR, the neurologist considers PML to be 
confirmed. As far as he knows, treatment included plasma exchange (PLEX). The patient was still hospitalized. 
Apart from dizziness, the patient did not have any relevant clinical symptoms. He is doing well.
Update 14 Feb 2014: The company field force forwarded two MRI reports, one dated 16 Aug 2013 and the other 
dated 28 Jan 2014 and in addition a discharge summary regarding a hospitalization from (b) (6)  to(b) (6)  
(b) (6)  as well as from (b) (6)  to (b) (6) .
The MRI report from 16 Aug 2013 notes unchanged demyelination in periventricular white matter, in anterior pons 
as well as at the transition to medulla oblongata; in right central cerebellar hemisphere, two small lesions were seen
(diameter below 5 mm each), one pre-existing and the other one newly identified and also showing very discrete 
contrast enhancement. 
The MRI report from 28 Jan 2014 notes that the patient?s last MS relapse had been in Apr 2013 (refer to DE-
BIOGENIDEC-2014BI016307). In comparison to previous MRI dated Aug 2013 the following findings were seen: in 
right cerebellar peduncle and cerebellar hemisphere confluent signal intensity with a circumference of 4 cm and 
inhomogeneous patchy contrast enhancement. Although the new lesion was confined to the cerebellum only and its
contrast enhancement was also considered to be rather untypical, the overall assessment was urgent suspicion of 
PML.
The discharge summary provided the following information: Patient?s previous MS treatment had been Avonex 
(interferon beta-1a; with recurring MS relapses; refer to DE-BIOGENIDEC-2014BI016003) from 1996 to 2006 and 
mitoxantrone in 2006. Medical history included congenital hip dysplasia which had been treated by a surgery, renal 
dysplasia which had also been surgically treated and erectile dysfunction. On anamnesis, the patient reported 
worsening of dizziness/ vertigo which had been present as a residual ever since a MS relapse in May 2012 (refer to
DE-BIOGENIDEC-2014BI016307). He had balance disorder and unsteady gait. Furthermore right-sided weakness 
and dysmetria were noted. Neurological findings on admission were unremarkable. A MRI of cervical and thoracic 
spine performed on (b) (6)  showed multiple lesions consistent with MS and without signs of an acute relapse.
Chest X-ray was normal. A lumbar puncture was performed on an unknown date. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and 
serum were tested positive for JC.virus at the specialized laboratory of the (b) (6)  The patient

was discharged on (b) (6)  but readmitted on(b) (6)  for treatment of PML. After the Shaldon?s catheter 
had been placed, PLEX was performed five times. Further treatment included mirtazapine (60 mg QD) and Lariam 
(mefloquine 250 mg, QW) as antiviral therapy as well as levetiracetam (500 mg, BID) for prevention of seizures. 
The patient was discharged home with a planned outpatient follow-up on (b) (6)
Update 19 Feb 2014: Based on internal review of existing information in the case,  Biogen Idec now considers this 
case to be a confirmed case of PML.
Update 27 Mar 2014: Additional information was received from the neurologist via the company field force, who 
reported that the patient is doing really well. The patient is currently residing at home. He has been diagnosed with 
IRIS; contrast enhancement was seen in MRI and there were some new small lesions seen in the pons (date 
unspecified). Other than double vision, the patient does not have new symptoms. He received several doses of 
cortisone (last one being 1000 mg for five days). Currently the patient is monitored via MRI every two weeks. 
Treatment with Keppra (levetiracetam) for epilepsy prophylaxis has been initiated. The outcome of the events of 
PML and IRIS was not provided.
Update 26 Aug 2014:  Additional information was received from the neurologist via a MSL (medical science liaison),
who reported that the patient was doing pretty well and was employed at the time of his visit about one month ago. 
The neurologist reported that the patient was treated with maraviroc (dates not reported); however, the patient was 
not free from viral load (not further specified, but assumed JCV PCR tests in CSF) for some time. However, no 
further viruses could be detected at the recent examination (not further specified).
Update 28 Nov 2014: Additional information was received from the neurologist via a Standardized PML Data 
Collection Tool. The patient is alive, residing at home, and is not currently on any MS therapy. The patient's 
Karnofsky and EDSS scores on 24 Oct 2014 were 90 (able to carry on normal activity; minor signs or symptoms of 
disease) and 4, respectively. A brain MRI was performed on 17 Sep 2014 (results not provided). On 27 Jul 2014, 
the patient had a negative liquor PCR result (local lab). The following lab values were obtained on 21 Jul 2014: 
leukocyte count 7000 (normal range 3500-9800 per microliter); lymphocyte count 27.3%; absolute lymphocyte 
count 1959 (normal range 900-4300 per microliter). The patient was diagnosed with IRIS; onset date was 18 Mar 
2014 and was determined by clinical symptoms and MRI findings. Clinical symptoms included fatigue 
(cognitive/behavioral), dysarthria (speech), and double vision (visual, cerebellar). The patient received 
corticosteroids pre- and post-IRIS onset. Treatment included the following: maraviroc 150 mg started 02 Apr 2014, 
300 mg started 23 Apr 2014, 150 mg started 24 Oct 2014; IV steroid pulse 500 mg started 18 Mar 2014 x 3 doses, 
1000 mg started 28 Mar 2014 x 3 doses, 1000 mg started 02 Jun 2014 x 5 doses; mefloquin 250 mg once weekly 
from 18 Mar 2014 to 17 Apr 2014; mirtazapin 60 mg started 18 Mar 2014, 30 mg started 14 Apr 2014 and stopped 
on 02 May 2014; and levetiracetam 500 mg. As of 24 Oct 2014, the patient has recovered from PML and IRIS.

Causality for the events was assessed as related to TYSABRI.
Update 31 Mar 2015: Additional information was received from the neurologist via a Standardized PML Data 
Collection Tool. The patient is alive, residing at home, and is currently on TECFIDERA (started 12 Jan 2015) for MS
therapy. The neurologist reported there was no evidence of disease activity (NEDA). The patient's Karnofsky and 
EDSS scores on 09 Mar 2015 were 80 (normal activity with effort; some signs or symptoms of disease) and 4, 
respectively. A brain MRI was performed on 18 Feb 2015 (results not reported). The neurologist provided a 
correction to the previous report and stated that the patient's estimated Karnofsky score on 24 Oct 2014 was 80. As
of 09 Mar 2015, the patient has recovered from PML and IRIS. Causality for the events was assessed as related to 
TYSABRI.
