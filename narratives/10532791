AER 1476786 is a spontaneous case, received on 16/Oct/2014, from a neurologist via a Biogen Idec representative
and concerns a 42 year old female patient who developed ataxia, dizziness, urinary tract infection and progressive 
multifocal leukoencephalopathy whilst treated with rituximab (Rituxan).
The patient's medical history included multiple sclerosis (MS) (diagnosed in 1997 and reported as "very 
aggressive") and increasing John Cunningham virus (JCV) antibody index. It was reported that, in between 
Mar/2009 and Sep/2009 she was not treated for multiple sclerosis (MS). Past drugs included interferon beta-1b 
(she received IFN beta 1b with a 2 months washout before switching to natalizumab in Sep/2009) , glatiramer 
acetate, interferon beta-1a, methylprednisolone sodium succinate and natalizumab (she received a total of 60 
natalizumab infusions between 2009-2014). Her disease was not adequately managed on IFN (interferon). She 
started intravenous natalizumab infusion 300 mg in September 2009 for better manage disease activity and the 
neurologist reported that when the patient was started on natalizumab she was JCV antibody negative (specific 
date of testing unknown).On 07/Jul/2010 her JCV antibody result was 0.898 nOD and on 04/Oct/2011 her JCV 
antibody result was 0.556 nOD. The patient later converted to JCV positive in 2014, with an index of 1.85 (specific 
date of testing unknown). On 27/Jan/2014, her JCV antibody test was positive (index 2.06) and again on 
19/Mar/2014 (positive index 2.23). In 17/Apr/2014, the patient underwent a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) 
scan was performed and result reported as normal diffusion, nothing that looked like progressive multifocal 
leukoencephalopathy (PML). Natalizumab seemed to stop relapses but was discontinued on 19/Jun/2014 due to 
increasing JC antibody index, the patient was asymptomatic at this time. Her concurrent conditions and 
concomitant medications were not reported. 
The patient was enrolled in (b) (6)  Later, following natalizumab washout, on 14/Jul/2014, she 
received intravenous rituximab infusion 1000 mg (frequency not reported) for an unknown indication. On 
30/Jul/2014, she received rituximab infusion, 1000 mg. Her JCV antibody result was positive (index 2.8). The 
neurologist stated that in (b) (6)  the patient experienced dizziness and ataxia and was hospitalized at her 
local hospital and was treated by a different physician. A MRI scan performed showed non-enhancements in PONS
and a few new findings in brainstem. There were also subtle symptomatic changes. A lumbar puncture was also 
performed. On (b) (6)  she underwent JCV DNA PCR testing and was read as positive (no values reported) 
and the neurologist was informed and confirmed that she was CSF JCV DNA positive but did not have a copy of the
report and did not know how many copies/ml were detected. At the time of hospitalization, she was found to have a 
urinary tract infection (UTI). The patient was treated with intravenous methylprednisolone followed by an oral steroid
and treatment was completed on(b) (6)  The patient experienced an improvement in dizziness and ataxia 
and she and was discharged (date of discharge unknown) from hospital. However, on 08/Oct/2014, she had new 
neurological symptoms of nystagmus, worsening of gait, and falls (presumed symptoms of suspect progressive 
multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML). On the same day a MRI scan showed a new vague area (lesion) with no 
clear margins, non-enhancing and was suspicious for PML (it was reported that " it doesn't look like MS but guess

there's always a chance it might be MS").  In Oct/2014, her MRI showed no changes. At the time of this report, a 
repeat lumbar puncture was planned and also mentioned that CSF JCV PCR testing would be sent to (b) (6) . In 
10/Unk/2014, her LP DNA sent to(b) (6)  read as positive (250 copies). Later, in November or December LP DNA sent
to (b) (6)  read as positive (116 copies). In Dec/2014, her MRI showed no changes. The physician based on current 
diagnostic impression on record as of 27/Jan/2015 stated that, rare form of PML did not show on MRI. At the time 
of this report, the current her current status was less severe symptoms (spasticity and cognition), mostly vertigo 
and she did not receive any MS therapy at this point.
At the time of this report, the outcome of the events of urinary tract infection and progressive multifocal 
leukoencephalopathy was unknown. It was not reported whether the therapy with rituximab was ongoing or not.
The neurologist assessed the causality of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy as unknown with rituximab 
and did not assess the causality of ataxia, dizziness and urinary tract infection with rituximab.
No further information was provided.
This confirmed case of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) is being expedited per 
Roche/Genentech Enhanced Pharmacovigilance Plan for PML.
Additional information received on 29/Jan/2015 and following information was added to the case: therapy details of 
rituximab and natalizumab, lab tests and event description.
