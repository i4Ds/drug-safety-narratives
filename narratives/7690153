corticotherapy and wide spectrum antibiotic therapy. For sedation, patient received midazolam plus fentanyl and 
since the same day patient was started on nor adrenaline to increase the blood pressure. The antibiotic therapy 
ineluded: imipern/azithromycin and trimeth.0  /sulfamethoxazol for prophylaxis of pneumonitis; they were stopped 
on 29-Nov-2010, as respiratory infection was discarded (unclear to be clarified). Vorciconazol was given from 22-
