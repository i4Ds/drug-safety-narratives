The neurologist reported that a male patient (age unknown) on TYSABRI (300 mg, IV, QM) for relapsing remitting 
Multiple Sclerosis from unknown date to unknown date (recieved 26 infusions) experienced suspect PML (onset 27 
Jan 2014).  On 26 Jan 2014, the patient underwent a follow up MRI which showed a faded frontal subcortical area 
that was suggestive of PML. The patient didn't show any [PML] symptoms. A CSF sample will be shipped to(b) (6)  
labs on 29 Jan 2014.  The outcome for the event suspect PML is unknown. The causality for the event of suspect 
PML is unknown.  It is unknown if TYSABRI treatment is ongoing.
Update 30 Jan 2014: The neurologist spontaneously reported the patient was on TYSABRI from 30 Mar 2011 until

13 Dec 2013, receiving his 27th infusion on 13 Dec 2013.  The patient's MRI revealed a not enhancing subcortical 
lesion in the temporal area.  The patient had tested positive for the presence JCV antibodies (date not provided).
The patient was previously on Betaferon (interferon beta-1b) from Feb 2007 until 2011 and it was discontinued due 
to the presence of Nabs. The patient did not receive any (IS) Immunosuppressant therapy. The patient's JCV 
antibody index value was reported as 3.66. At the time of this report the patient was residing at home.
Update 05 Feb 2014: Additional information was received from the neurologist who reported the aliquot of the CSF 
was tested at the local lab and the test was positive. Test sensitivity was unknown.
Update 11 Feb 2014: Additional information was received from the neurologist who reported that the patient tested 
positive for JCV DNA presence (366 copies/mL) so the PML diagnosis was confirmed.
Update 19 Feb 2014: Additional information was received from the neurologist via a MS Standardized PML Data 
Collection Tool. The physician assessed the patient?s estimated Karnofsky and EDSS scores as 100 (normal, no 
complaints; no evidence of disease) and 1.5, respectively, on 30 Mar 2011, 19 Dec 2012, and 23 Dec 2013. Anti-
JCV antibody status on 14 Feb 2011 was positive. On 25 Sep 2013, anti-JCV antibody status was positive with an 
index of 3.662. MRIs were done on 06 Aug 2013 and on 23 Dec 2013 (results not reported). A lumbar puncture was
performed on 27 Jan 2014 and analyzed by(b) (6)  on 09 Feb 2914: results were positive for CSF JCV DNA at 366 
copies per mL (previously reported). Currently, the patient, who is 38 years old at the time of the event of PML, is 
alive and residing at home. He has not recovered from PML. Causality for the event was assessed as related to 
TYSABRI.
Update 20 Feb 2014: Additional information was received from the neurologist. For the previously reported MRI on 
26 Jan 2014, the neurologist additionally reported that the lesion in the subcortical area was approximately 2 cm in 
size. Treatment for the event of PML included mefloquine 250 mg/day for 3 days from 28 Dec 2013 to 30 Dec 
"2014" [presumed 2013]; mefloquine 250 mg QW (start date not provided); and mirtazapine 15 mg/day x 3 days 
(dates not provided) followed by mritazapine 30 mg (dosing frequency and dosing dates not provided). This case 
was entered into the Pharmacovigilance Network (ID 238919).
Update 28 Feb 2014: Biogen Idec considers this case confirmed for the diagnosis of PML based on positive CSF 
and MRI findings.
Update 06 Mar 2014: A report was received from the Italian regulatory authority (ID 238919), AIFA, via the National 
Pharmacovigilance Network. 23 Dec 2013 was indicated as the onset date for the event of suspect radiologic PML 
(onset initially reported as 27 Jan 2014). Mefloquine 250 mg/week and mirtazapine therapy was administered up to 
60/mg per day. The patient was asymptomatic until 15 Feb 2014 when the patient experienced a subacute sensory

motor impairment in the left hemi side. The MRI performed on 17 Feb 2014 showed a volumetric increase of the 
lesion, compatible with PML, without any contrast medium enhancement. On (b) (6)  the patient experienced 
a generalized epileptic seizure during a temperature increase. The patient was brought via ambulance to the 
hospital and was successfully treated with IV Valium? (diazepam). Additional treatment consisted of Oxcarbazepine
up to 600 mg/day and amoxicillin+clavulanate 875+125 mg/day. Testing included a chest xray which was negative; 
a CT which was negative for acute lesions; and hematochemical tests which showed leucocytosis (about 16000 
WBC/mcl). A follow up MRI performed on (b) (6)  showed a further volumetric increase of the lesion, 
compatible with PML diagnosis, with contrast medium enhancement. The event, generalized epileptic seizure, 
resolved. The event, PML, is ongoing. Causality was not provided for the events.
Update 06 Mar 2014: Additional information was received from the neurologist via a Biogen Idec Medical Science 
Liaison (MSL) who provided the MRI reports for the brain and spinal cord MRIs which were both performed on 23 
Dec 2013; and a follow-up spinal MRI on(b) (6)
Brain MRI performed on 23 Dec 2013: The exam was performed through weighted sequences in DP, T2 also with 
FLAIR technique on axial plane, T1 sagittal weighted sequences and T1 sequences weighted after i.v. contrast 
medium administration on axial plane. The current exam was compared to the previous one performed on 05 Aug 
2013. The current exam showed a signal alteration area, hyperintense in T2, without any enhancement, located in 
the right temporal white matter. This finding, which was not detectable in the previous MRI, would need to be 
assessed in a short period (1 or 2 months) eventually through a spectroscopy exam or a perfusion weighted MRI. 
Moreover the signal alteration areas, hyperintense in DP, T2 and in T2-FLAIR, located in the right cerebellar area, 
in the pons, in the thalamus, in the periventricular and subcortical white matter, in the corona radiate and in the 
semioval centers, bilaterally. After i.v. contrast medium administration, none of the above described areas showed 
any enhancement. The punctiform enhancing area located in the right frontal cortical-subcortical area was 
substantially unchanged, compatible with an ectatic venous structure. The IV ventricle was regular and in its place. 
The subtentorial ventricular system had barely increased in size and are on axis compared to the midline. The 
subaracnoid spaces of the base and the convexity were barely enlarged.
Total spinal cord MRI performed on 23 Dec 2013: The current exam was performed through T2 weighted 
sequences and T1 weighted sequences after i.v. contrast medium administration, on sagittal planes. The current 
exam was compared to the previous one performed on 05 Aug 2013. The current exam showed that the signal 
alteration areas, hyperintense in T2, located in the following segments: C3-C4, C4, C6-C7, D2-D3, D5, D6, D6 and 
D8-D9, were substantially unchanged. After i.v. contrast medium administration there weren?t pathological 
enhancements. The other findings were substantially unchanged. Conclusions: the above described findings are 
compatible with the presence of tissue impairment of flogistic-demyelinating origin without any blood brain barrier 
alteration.

MRI performed on (b) (6)  MRI technique: axial images T2 weighted, also through FLAIR, DP and T1 
volumetric technique (sagittal partitios and multiplanar reconstructions). After i.v. paramagnetic contrast medium 
administration, T1 weighted images on axial planes. For the spinal cord T1 and T2 weighted sagittal images after 
contrast medium administration. The current exam was compared to the previous one performed in the same 
Health structure on 23 Dec 2013. The T2 hyperintense finger like area was mildly increased in size, located in the 
right temporal cortical-subcortical area which currently involves the periventricular white matter, adjacent to the 
trigone of the homolateral lateral ventricle, the posterior lenticular area, area between the capsule and the 
thalamus, and the homolateral thalamic area. Such finding, without any evident enhancement after contrast 
medium administration, could lead to an ambiguous interpretation. PML is proposed as diagnosis and such 
diagnosis would need to be confirmed through both clinical and lab data and by an urgent neurological visit. A very 
close follow up, both clinical and neuroradiologic is suggested. Some small punctiform areas occurred, ascribable 
to the pathology already known in anamnesis, without any enhancements after contrast medium administration, 
located in the subcortical, fronto-partietal and right temporal area; a moderate volumetric increase of one of the T2 
hyperintense areas coexists in the thalamic area, homolaterally. The signal areas with the same signal features, 
located in the white matter of both the semioval centers, in the corona radiata bilaterally, in the subcortical and 
periventricular bihemispheric area, in the brainstem, in the corpus callosum, in the thalamus and in the left 
cerebellar hemisphere were substantially unchanged in number, size and signal features. None of the above 
mentioned areas showed evident enhancement after contrast medium administration. Small venous drainage 
impairment still persists in the right upper frontal subcortical area. The ventricular cavities were unchanged in 
morphology and the volume in the supratentorial and subtentorial area as well as the periencephalic liquoral spaces
of the cranial volta and base. Some flogisitc nuclei were observed in some ethmoidal cells, bilaterally; a 
pseudocystic and likely flogistic thickening still remains in the left jaw area. The spinal cord analysis was essentially 
comparable to the one observed in the previous MRI performed on 23 Dec 2013. The T2 hyperintense areas were 
observable and unchanged, in the cervical intramedullary area in the following metameric segments: C2-C3, C3-
C4, C5-C6, C6-C7 and some others in the dorsal intramedullary area in the segment D2-D3, D4-D6, D7 and D9-
D10. After i.v. contrast medium administration no pathological intramedullary enhancement were observed. The 
other MRI findings resulted unchanged.
Update 20 Mar 2014: A follow-up report was received from the Italian regulatory authority (ID 238919), AIFA, via the
National Pharmacovigilance Network. The adverse reaction, PML, has been classified as expected according to the
PL. The Regional Centre (Centro Regionale Lazio) stated that the relationship between the drug and the adverse 
reaction, evaluated through Naranjo algorithm, is probable.
Update 14 Oct 2014: Additional information was received from the neurologist via a MS Standardized PML Data 
Collection Tool. The patient is alive, residing at home, and is not currently on any MS therapy. The neurologist 
assessed the patient?s estimated Karnofsky and EDSS scores on 03 Oct 2014 to be 90 (able to carry on normal

activity; minor signs or symptoms of disease) and 2, respectively. A brain MRI was performed on 26 Jun 2014 
(results not provided). The patient was diagnosed with IRIS, determined by MRI findings and clinical symptoms. 
Clinical symptoms included strength deficit in left limbs (focal motor; onset date 28 Feb 2014), grand mal/ tonic-
clonic seizures (multifocal seizure; onset date 26 Feb 2014), left limb tactile hyposthenia (focal sensory; onset date 
28 Feb 2014); and fever (onset date 07 Mar 2014). The patient received corticosteroids post-IRIS onset. Treatment
for IRIS included mefloquine 240 mg PO weekly from 27 Jan 2014 to 11 Apr 2014; mirtazapine 60 mg PO from 27 
Jan 2014 to 20 May 2014; Solumedrol 1 GM IV daily from 08 Jan 2014 to 22 Mar 2014; and Deltacortene 50 mg 
PO daily from 07 Jan 2014 to 20 May 2014. As of 03 Oct 2014, the patient had recovered from PML and had 
recovered from IRIS. Causality for the events was assessed as related to TYSABRI.

Natalizumab related PML:  Atypical neuroradiological findings.  Presented at the 27th Annual Meeting of the 
European Congress of Radiology (ECR); Vienna Austria.  02 Mar 2015.  Eighteen patients with suspected PML 
lesions were sampled.  Three radiologic patters were defined:  anergic, mainly white matter non-enhancing lesions, 
inflammatory white matter lesions with punctate or curvilinear enhancement and atypical.  Lesions prevail in the left 
frontal lobe.  Focal lesions involved the subcortical WM in 16 patients, the deep WM in 10 and the grey matter 8 
cases. PML lesions were hypointense on T1w and hyperintense on DWI in 14 pts. All patients have hyperintense 
lesions on T2w images. Focal lesions enhanced in 5 cases. At the beginning of the disease pattern A was observed
in 3 patients and pattern B in 3 cases. The "atypical pattern" with cortical involvement was detected in 9 patients 
and with "milky way sign" in 5.
Update 20 Mar 2015:  The neurologist spontaneously reported the last available clinical information. The patient 
presented with a stable clinical picture and did not develop more epileptic seizures. Treatment included Lamictal
(lamotrigine) 100x2, started in Nov 14 [2014]. Previously the patient was treated with Tolep (oxcarbazepine) 300x2. 
A neurological examination showed pyramidal and sensitive signs. The patient can walk without support and 
without stopping for more than 300 m. The neuro-radiological picture was up to date, unchanged and inactive. The 
patient attended the follow-up examinations in Apr, Jun through Sept and Nov [2014]. He will undergo a new 
examination shortly.  In Jan [2015] copolymer therapy was proposed; however, the patient wanted to think about it 
and perform a new MRI before starting. He experienced significant weight loss, so further diagnostic investigations 
were required. The patient experienced an improvment in mood without the need for pharmacological support.  No 
additional information was reported.
Update 30 Mar 2015: Additional information was received from a neurologist via a MS Standardized PML Data 
Collection Tool. The patient is alive, residing at home, and is not currently on any MS therapy. On 08 Jan 2015, the 
neurologist assessed the patient estimated Karnofsky and EDSS scores to be 80 (normal activity with effort; some 
signs or symptoms of disease) and 4.5, respectively. On 13 Nov 2014, a brain MRI was performed with results

reported as follows: non active lesion burden unchanged compared to one observed in Jun 2014, no 
enhancements after contrast medium administration were found (MRI report not available). The patient will undergo
further MRI testing in the upcoming months. As of 08 Jan 2015, the patient has not recovered from PML and has 
not recovered from IRIS (outcomes discrepant from previous report). Causality for the events of PML and IRIS was 
assessed as related to TYSABRI.
