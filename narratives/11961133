Solicited report from the USA by a consumer of a 9 year old male with events of non-serious FATIGUE, BACK 
PAIN, SHOULDER PAIN/BUTTOCK PAIN and KNEE PAIN with HUMIRA (ADALIMUMAB).  The patient had a 
relevant medical history of SEVERE JOINT PAIN IN HIPS, SEVERE JOINT PAIN IN SHOULDERS and SEVERE 
JOINT PAIN IN KNEES.
On 26 Mar 2015, the patient experienced FATIGUE.  After taking his first dose of HUMIRA, the patient was walking 
using his crutches by that evening. He never experienced such relief from a medication. However, by 26 Mar 2015, 
he was so fatigued that he could not finish school.  On 27 Mar 2015, the patient experienced BACK PAIN, 
SHOULDER PAIN/BUTTOCK PAIN and KNEE PAIN.  On 27 Mar 2015, the patient finished school, but when the 
patient's grandma picked him up, he was complaining of back, shoulder, buttock, and knee pain. He was so tired 
that he could not lift his backpack. The primary reporter did not have the lot information since the patient's grandma
did not have any HUMIRA packaging available. No further follow up information was available.
