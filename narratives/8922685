PROTOCOL TITL 
A clinical investigator reported that a 09-year-old Caucasian female patient was hospitalized due to grade 3 febrile 
neutropenia and grade 4 leukopenia while enrolled in a study involving therapy with dasatinib for acute 
lymphoblastic leukemia. The patient also received back ground therapy with cyclophosphamide and 
mercaptopurine. 
The patient received oral dasatinib 60 mg daily from 17-Aug-2012. She received 6-mercaptopurine from 11-Sep- 
2012 to 08-Oct-2012 and cyclophosphamide on 08-Oct-2012. On the patient developed febrile 
neutropenia and leukopenia which required hospitalization. On complete blood count (CBC) with 
differential was performed (results not provided). The patient was treated for the events. No action was taken with 
dasatinib therapy in response to the events. At the time of this report, the patient had not recovered from febrile 
neutropenia and leukopenia. Therapy with dasatinib was continuing. 
Supplemental information received from the clinical investigator on 25-oct-2012 reported.that the patient developed 
grade Ill infectious enterocolitis on 411111111111. grade II colitis on 11111111.11and grade Ill diarrhea on.", 
111111and these events required hospitalization. The last dose of dasatinib was received on 19-Oct-2012. 
The patient's continued hospitalization from She began stooling on 41111111Dand sample was 
sent for testing. The test turned positive on and the patient had increased diarrhea to grade Ill.

The patient restarted oral dasatinib therapy at a dose of 45mg on 20-Nov-2012. She also received asparaginase 
(Elspar) at a dose '22,750 units' intravenously on 02-Dec-2012. She complained of burning and itching over lips 
followed by sudden altered mental state and difficulty to arouse within a few minutes after receiving asparaginase. 
Immediate medical attention was provided. The patient had hypotension but no respiratory distress. She also had 
one episode of vomiting after receiving epinephrine but no aspiration. Therapy with asparaginase was discontinued 
in response to this event. No action was taken regarding study drug. On the same day (02-Dec-2012), the patient 
had recovered from the event. 
Supplemental information received from the clinical investigator on 24-Dec-2012 and 02-Jan-2013 reported that the 
patient had received oral dasatinib 45 (unit not reported) from 19-Dec-2012 and its continuing at the time of this 
report. The patient also received oral dexamethasone 6mg from 19-Dec-2012 and also received high dose 
cytarabine 1820mg twice daily from 19-Dec-2012 to 20-Dec-2012. The patient had received intravenous etoposide 
90mg twice daily from 21-Dec-2012 to 22-Dec-2012 and received intravenous etoposide 90mg on 23-Dec-2012. 
The patient was 15minutes into the IV pegaspargase infusion 255 Units on 24-Dec-2012.. On the same day, the 
patient had experienced anaphylaxis (grade III). The event was assessed as medically significant. The patient had 
a symptom of facial flushing, swollen lips, sore throat and a heart rate of 165. The patient had an oxygen saturation 
of 88% on room air. The patient was treated with hydrocortisone 100mg, intramuscular epinephrine 0.15mg once 
as well as oxygen. The patient had received intrathecal methotrexate 12mg, intrathecal cytarabine 30mg and 
intrathecal hydrocortisone (HC) 12mg on 24-Dec-2012. The event anaphylaxis resolved on 24-Dec-2012. No 
action taken regarding the study therapy due to the event. 
Supplemental information received from the investigator on 02-Apr-2013 included the following: 
On 01-Aug-2012, the patient was diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, which was later determined to be 
Philadelphia chromosome positive. At the time of this report, she was in remission and received treatment on ''COG 
AALL 1122" study and received consolidation block 1 between 02-Nov-2012 and 08-Nov-2012. Two days prior to 
admission she had several episodes of vomiting with little oral intake and she had a brief episode of stiffening and 
syncopal like episode prior to admission. She was sent to the emergency department and was found to be

pancytopenic, had hyponatremia, mucositis and dehydration. Further the patient was admitted for hospitalization. 
She continued on Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) during her hospitalization for post chemotherapy 
treatment as per protocol. She required several transfusions with platelets and packed red blood cells. On 
admission her complete blood cell count (CEC) showed a white blood cell (WBC) of 0.1, anemia with hemoglobin of 
6.8 for which she was transfused. Her hematocrit was 18.4 with an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) of 0. From 12-
Nov-2012, her dasatinib therapy was held due to oral mucositis and diarrhea. On 20-Nov-2012, both symptoms 
completely resolved and her dasatinib therapy was restarted at a reduce dose of 45 mg/m2 daily. On the same day, 
therapy with G-CSF was also discontinued because she had a WBC of 7800, hemoglobin 10.2 and platelets 34,000 
with an ANC of 3800. Her CBC on the day of discharge showed a WBC of 7900. On the day of discharge, the 
patient's hemoglobin was 10:8 with grade I anemia that not required transfusion and profound thrombocytopenia 
with platelets of 23,000. She was transfused with 1 unit of platelets prior to discharge. She would continue on 
dasatinib as an outpatient and will have labs by home care for CBC and difficile (diff) on  
She had significant oral mucositis grade 3 with significant swelling on admission and had borderline hypotension 
and developed grade 3 diarrhea with more than 4 - loose bowel movements a day. The stool was negative for 
clostridium difficile (C, diff) but she was started on intravenous flagyl since she had previous history of C. diff colitis 
and since ultrasound of the abdomen done on .showed residual mild wall thickening with fluid filled 
areas. On 4.1.111M her blood culture showed E. coli which was susceptible to cephalosporins and resistant to 
gentamicin. She was empirically started on vancomycin, cefepime and gentamicin as well as intravenous flagyl. 
After the sensitivity was back, the gentamicin was discontinued and she was continued on vancomycin for severe 
oral mucositis, which was stopped on 19-Nov-2012 after great improvement in her mucositis. 
On 1 she also had a urine culture which showed only 20,000 organisms of E. doll with the same 
sensitivity. It was not clear if the bacteremia produced the bacteriuria or vice versa but after consultation with 
physician from 11.111111.1.1.1.11Millinit was decided to treat her with 10 days of intravenous cefepime which 
she continued on 21-Nov-2012. She developed fever shortly after admission and became afebrile on 1111.11.1Mi 
Blood culture became negative from INIMME Stools were sent for rotavirus antigen and norovirus antigen and 
were found to be negative. Her diarrhea improved gradually and resolved on 20 Nov-2012 and desitin was 
restarted. 
She was not started on total parenteral nutrition (TPN) but had fair oral intake and gradually improved her appetite 
and her weight was up to 23 kilos on the day of discharge with no nausea, vomiting or diarrhea and complete 
resolution of her mucositis. Vancomycin was discontinued. 
She had two episodes of brief loss of consciousness with stiffening of her body. She was evaluated by a pediatric 
neurologist, who suspected that those episodes, especially in the setting of fever, anemia and dehydration, were

due to syncope and not seizures. An electroencephalography (EEG) was done which showed no seizure activity 
and she had no recurrence of those episodes after the initial 2 days of hospitalization. 
On admission, she had low sodium of 129 with potassium of 3.6, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 21 and creatinine. 
She was given intravenous (IV) fluid boluses and IV fluids and was started on antibiotics and her sodium corrected 
gradually as well as her SUN and creatinine. On the day of discharge she was tolerated oral intake and her sodium 
was 138 with a BUN of 1 and creatinine of 0.5, She would continue on septra prophylaxis as an outpatient. 
She was discharged home on a regular diet and activity as tolerated onellinalland would have CBC with diff 
by Home Care on L to determine if she was ready for the next phase of chemotherapy.
