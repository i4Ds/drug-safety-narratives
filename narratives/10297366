Case number PHHY2014DK083551, is an initial literature report received on 03 Jul 2014. The author discussed 
about fatal progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy in a kidney transplant recipient 19 years after successful 
renal allograft transplantation. This report refers to 60-years-old female patient with renal allograft recipient. Her 
medical history included kidney failure in Jan 1993 owing to autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease with 
initiation of continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis until renal allograft transplantation in (b) (6)  In addition, 
she developed post-transplant diabetes mellitus and hypertension. The primary immunosuppressive treatment 
included ciclosporin (unknown manufacturer), azathioprine (unknown manufacturer) and methylprednisolone 
(unknown manufacturer) for an unknown duration. First renal allograft biopsy was done in Oct 1993, demonstrating 
acute rejection. Initial treatment with high-dose methylprednisolone was ineffective, necessitating treatment with the
monoclonal antibody muromonab- CD3 before induction of remission. An uneventful course followed from 1993 to 
2011. Owing to a rapid decline of kidney function in July 2011, a second renal allograft biopsy was done with 
pathology demonstrating chronic allograft nephropathy, acute humoral rejection, and no histologic evidence of 
polyomavirus nephropathy. Using Luminex technology donor specific HLA-A1 and -DQ antibodies were found. 
Treatment included plasmapheresis, immunoglobulin therapy, and conversion of immunosuppressive therapy to

mycophenolic acid (unknown manufacturer), tacrolimus (unknown manufacturer) and methylprednisolone. No 
antibody treatment of any kind was administered. Subsequently, renal function stabilized until the end of 2012, 
when renal insufficiency developed and a peritoneal catheter was placed. The patient was admitted to the hospital 
in (b) (6)  on suspicion of uremic encephalopathy. Symptoms included recent onset of latency, mild cognitive 
impairment, and altered diurnal rhythm. Estimated glomerular filtration rate was 8 mL/min/1.73 m2 (CKD-EPI). 
Upon admittance in (b) (6)  uremic encephalopathy was suspected and dialysis was initiated. Despite declining 
azotemia, cerebral impairment persisted. Biochemistry demonstrated normal infectious parameters, normal 
immunoglobulin status, normal thyroid status, and no significant electrolyte or other metabolic derangement than 
uremia. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for BK virus and cytomegalovirus was negative. Symptoms progressed 
with development of focal neurologic deficits including anomia and facial nerve paralysis. Computed tomography of 
the brain demonstrated an uncharacteristic hypointensity in the left frontal lobe. Ensuing FLAIR and T2-weighted 
magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated cerebral foci of demyelination and gliosis characterized by abnormal 
increased signal in the left frontal lobe. A diagnosis of PML was confirmed by a clearly positive qualitative JC 
polyomavirus (JCV) DNA PCR in the cerebrospinal fluid. No brain biopsy was performed and urinary JCV PCR was 
negative. Treatment was initiated with discontinuation of immunosuppressive therapy. The patient was transferred 
to another hospital. Because of her severe renal insufficiency, no antiviral therapy was considered viable. Her 
cerebral status deteriorated with development of progressive global aphasia, hemiparesis, partial epilepsy, and 
somnolence. Cerebral magnetic resonance imaging in (b) (6)  demonstrated unambiguous progression with 
extensive abnormalities in both frontal lobes and parietal lobes. Approximately(b)(6)  months after the onset of 
symptoms, the patient died. Autopsy report was not specified. The author concluded that occurrence of PML is 
related to immunosuppressive status and possibly distinctive immunosuppressive therapy.
