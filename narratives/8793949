MEDICALLY SIGNIFICANT
On 5 and 11 Sep 12
A neurologist then the study investigator (study (b) (6) ) reported that a 45 year old female patient 
receiving TYSABRI (300 mg, IV, QM) since 26 Jun 09 for multiple sclerosis and enrolled in (b) (6)
 presented with features consistent with PML diagnosis from 08 Aug 12. 
Regarding PML risk factors, anti-JCV antibodies were found positive (date unknown), the patient had never been 
treated with immunosuppressive drugs but received Avonex from Nov 98 to Jul 02, then Rebif from Jul 02 to Jun 09
for MS before TYSABRI, duration of treatment was more than 2 years. Last and 41st TYSABRI infusion was 
performed on 31 Jul 12. 
On 8 Aug 12, the patient began to experience quadranopsia, having led to perform brain MRI, which showed a PML
suggestive occipital lesion in white matter without Gd enhancement. The investigator also mentioned that she

experienced some balance disorders. Then a lumbar puncture was performed on (b) (6)  for JCV PCR testing in
CSF and result came back positive (500 copies/ml - normal range<250) from a local lab. A second lumbar puncture
was performed on 5 Sep 12 and CSF sample was sent to (b) (6)  for JCV PCR, results pending. The patient also 
underwent plasma exchanges. According to the study investigator, PML diagnosis was established and considered 
as related to TYSABRI which was permanently discontinued (last and 41st infusion on 31 Jul 12).
EDSS was assessed several times and was 3.5 before TYSABRI on 12Jan 09, remained 4.0 under TYSABRI 
(except on 19 Sep 11 when it was assessed 4.5) and was also assessed 4.0 on 07 Jun 12 under TYSABRI before 
PML. The patient s allergy, concomitant medication or other relevant medical information was not provided. 
French imputability is C2 S2 I2.
On 19 Sep 2012
Biogen Idec considers this case as confirmed for PML based on positive CSF and clinical symptoms.
French imputability is C2 S2 I2.
On 03 Oct 12
A neurologist reported further details. Biological analysis of CSF (protein, glucose and cloride) showed normal 
result. It was observed 1 erythrocyte and 1 cell, Gram coloration was negative. The brain MRI on 16 Aug 12 was 
considered stable by the radiologist (then re-analyzed by the neurologist, who found PML suggestive lesion) 
comparing to the previous one on 23 Apr 12. On brain MRI performed in another site on 5 Sep 12 it was observed 
right parieto-occipital hypersignal in T2 / Flair, without Gd enhancement and PML suggestive. Clinical PML signes 
were described as lateral inferior homonimous quadranopsia since 8 Aug 12  and focal motor disorders (left 
superior dysmetria - forearm weakness). The result of 2nd lumbar puncture came positive (344 copies/ml) from 
(b) (6) . 3 sessions of plasmatic exchanges were performed on 6, 8 and 10 Sep 12. On 3 Oct 12 the patient was at 
home with no needs of support.  Her EDSS was 4.0 (not changed on time of PML diagnosis). Karnofsky score was 
assessed 70 (not changed since 24 Feb 2009). Her MS state before PML consisted in motor disorders (walking 
perimeter < 500 m), imperious miction and fatigue. The patient received Solumedrol IV 1g/day on 20 and 21 Aug 12
as the clinical signs were considered first as MS relapse. Before TYSABRI, the patient was treated consequently 
with Avonex, Betaferon and Rebif, all stopped because not effective (see Avonex case AERS 2012BI043524).
At the time of reporting no IRIS was declared 4 weeks after plasmatic exchanges.
French imputability is C2 S2 I2.
Update 03 Dec 2012
The study investigator reported that the patient s medical history included high blood pressure since 16 Oct 2006. 
As concomitant treatment, she was given Triella since 10 Feb 2003 for contraception and Olmetec since 16 Oct 
2006 for high blood pressure. At the time of reporting, both medications were on going.  She was hospitalized  from
(b) (6)  to (b) (6)  At this time of reporting, the patient hadnt recovered.

On 22 Mar 2013
The investigator stated that Karnofsky score decreased to 60 (was 70 on 5 Sep 12). Brain MRIs performed on 13 
and 15 Feb 2013 showed right parieto-occipital lesion due to sequelae of PML, left Gd enhanced parieto-occipital 
lesion with hemorrhagic remodeling and contrast enhancement of the left internal capsule. Moreover, a lumbar 
puncture performed on 18 Feb 2013 came back negative for JCV DNA in CSF on 25 Feb 2013.
At the time of reporting, the patient was discharged home and switched to AVONEX therapy since 05 Mar 2013.
On an unknown date, the patient developed an IRIS determined on MRI findings and characterized by the following 
symptoms: persistant delusions, loss of vision since 29 Jan 2013, focal seizure evolving to status epilepticus on 15 
Feb 2013 and persistant fatigue. The event of IRIS was treated with courses of Solumedrol (3 g IV from 18 to 19 
Oct 2012 and 3 g IV from 21 to 23 Dec 2012).
At the time of reporting, the neurologist assessed the event of PML as resolved since 14 Sep 2012 and the event of
IRIS as not related to TYSABRI and not resolved.
No further information was provided.
French imputability is C2 S2 I2.
On 2 May 13
The investigator reported that EDSS score on 02 May 13 was 5.0. The patient discontinued (b) (6)
(b) (6)  on the same day.
No further information was provided.

Update 11 Dec 2013
The neurologist reported that on 10 Dec 2013, estimated Karnofsky score was 60. On 26 Sep 2013, estimated 
EDDS was 4. On 25 Sep 2013, MRI revealed right occipital PML sequelae without Gd enhancement and left 
occipital lesion. Since last reporting, no new lumbar puncture has been done. AVONEX was initiated on 01 Mar 
2013 and was still on going at the time of reporting. The patient stayed at home with a mild degree of disabling 
(visual defect, mainly in the left visual field, seizures with antiepileptic drug continued). The patient needed help 
from relatives in the daily living activities and was not able to work and it was hard to watch TV and to read. On 10 
Oct 2012, the patient had recovered from PML. The neurologist assessed PML and IRIS related to TYSABRI.
No further information was provided.

FOIA Case Report Information
EDSS score was 6. The most recent brain MRI (routine MRI) performed on 04 Feb 2014 revealed constant 
sequelar bi-occipital signals, same for a serpiginous signal in the left occipital groove. Cortical sub-cortical atrophy; 
no change comparing to MRI in Aug and Sep 2013. The patient is at home, receiving AVONEX since 01 Mar 2013. 
Motor function without changes. The patient has right Mingazzini sign; partial seizures 3 times (Feb 2013, Sep 
2013, Mar 2014); visual left deficit (lateral homonymous hemianopsia). The physician assessed the PML as related 
to Tysabri and resolved as of 10 Oct 2012; IRIS was assessed as related and resolved as of 01 Mar 2013. French 
Imputability C2S2I2.
Update 23 Sep 2014: Additional information was received from the neurologist.  On 05 Mar 2013, the patient began
therapy with Avonex (interferon beta-1a), started for preventative reasons and is ongoing.  On 24 Jun 2014, EDSS 
score was 6.  Brain MRI performed on 21 Jul 2014 showed no change since August 2013.  On 10 Sep 2014, 
Karnofsky score was 60. The patient is currently at home. PML outcome is recovered. The patient recovered on 14 
Sep 2012 (previously reported as 10 Oct 2012). According to the neurologist, the PML is related to TYSABRI. The 
outcome of the IRIS is recovered. The patient recovered on 25 Jun 2014 (previously reported as 01 Mar 2013). 
According to the neurologist, the IRIS is related to TYSABRI. French Imputability: C2S2I2.
Update 12 Jun 2015: Follow-up information reported by the study investigator indicated that an MRI was done in 
Jun 2009 (previously reported as 11 Jun 2009) before TYSABRI initiation in Jun 2009; then, MRIs were done in Oct
2010 (results not provided), in Sept 2011 (results not provided), and April 2012 (previously reported 23 Apr 2012). 
Another MRI was done in Aug 2012 (previously reported as 16 Aug 2012) due to PML occurrence. MRI monitoring 
was about 1 MRI per year. At the time of reporting, MRI monitoring takes account of PML risk factors: prior 
immunosuppressive therapy, JCV serology, duration of TYSABRI treatment and index value. The current MRI 
monitoring is 1 MRI every 3 months (by the same radiologist to have similar MRI sections) if the JCV serology is 
positive. No further information was provided. French imputability : C2 S2 I2
