The report received from an investigator via Millennium Pharmaceuticals (manufacture # 2013MP1000410 )refers to 
a white female patient aged 09 years, from study AALLO7P1, A Phase II Pilot trial of Bortezornib (PS-341 ,Velcade) 
in Combination With Intensive Re-induction Therapy for Children With Relapsed Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia 
(ALL) and Lymphoblastic Lymphoma (LL). 
The patient was diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia in September 2010 (exact data not provided, primary 
site.: bone marrow). Prior therapies for the acute lymphoblastic leukemia included chemotherapy multiple agents 
systemic. The patient's medical and past surgical histories, current conditions and allergy history were not provided. 
The patient was scheduled to receive Block 1 (course=35 days) which consisted of bortezomib (VELCADE) 1.3 
mglm2, via intravenous push over 3-5 seconds on Days 1, 4, e and 11; cytarabine 30-70 mg and based on age, 
Intrathecal (IT) on day 1: doxorubicin 60 mglm2, intravenously (IV), over 15 minutes on Day 1; asparaginase 2500 
IU/m2, intramuscularly (IM) or IV over 1-2 hours on day 2, 8, 15 and 22 and was administered bortezomib 
(VELCADE) and asparaginase from 06-SEP-2013 to 16-SEP-2013, cytarabine from 05-SEP-2013 to 05-SEP-2013, 
doxorubicin from 06-SEP-2013 to 06-SEP-2013 and vincristine from 06-SEP-2013 to 13-SEP-2013. The patient last 
received study medication on Cycle 1, Day 11. Concomitant therapy included diphenhydramine hydrochloride 
(BENADRYL). 
On 16-SEP-2013, the patient developed a rash on the lower extremity with pruritis, which resolved after treatment 
with diphenhydramine (BENDADRYL) (details not provided). Treatment included Etwina shots (details not 
provided). Additional findings included platelet count 8000 (unit and reference ranges not provided). The patient 
was given a platelet transfusion as well as day 11 bortezomib (VELCADE). 
On 17-SEP-2013, the patient presented with pain 6/10 with associated phonolphotophobia. Around noon, the 
patient developed a fever of 100.5 degrees Fahrenheit which spiked to 101.2 degrees Fahrenheit approximately 20 
minutes later. On 18-SEP-2013, the patient experienced the medically significant event grade 2 seizure. Ong 
the patient experienced medically significant, life-threatening event grade 4 sepsis, resulting in 
ospitalization. 
The patient was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) in septic shock. Blood culture return positive for gram 
positive cocci in chains with streptococci, alpha hemolytic. Upon arrival to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) 
the patient was in the process of being intubated. While attempting to get onto the bedside commode, the patient 
arched and developed generalized seizures. The patient was immediately moved to the bed. While awaiting 
lorazepam (ATIVAN), the patient developed a brief run of asystole which lasted approximately 10 seconds. A code 
was called and chest compression were initiated for approximately 10-15 seconds. No resuscitation medications 
were required. The patient's asystole spontaneously resolved with resumption of sinus tachycardia. The patient had 
a pulse at this time. Once stabilized, the patient was taken to radiology and remained hemodynamically stable

FOIA Case Report Information 
throughout the procedure. 
On MEM no other seizures of asystole were reported. The patient was reported still intubated. Plans were 
made-toeXtubated the patient that evening. 
In response to the vents sepsis and seizure, the action taken with bortezomib (VELCADE), vincristine, doxorubicin, 
asparaginase and cytarabine were not provided. 
The outcomes of sepsis and seizure were reported as not recovered/not resolved. 
The investigator considered the causality of seizure as possibly related to bortezomib (VELCADE), vincristine, 
doxorubicin, asparaginase and cytarabine and asystole grade 1. The investigator considered the causality of sepsis 
as possibly related to bortezomib (VELCADE), vincristine, doxorubicin and cytarabine and asystole grade 1 and 
probably related to asparaginase. 
No further information is expected for this case.
