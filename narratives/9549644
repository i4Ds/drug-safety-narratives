FOIA Case Report Information 
The investigator recommended bronchoscopy with transbronchial lung biopsy and bronchoalveolar lavage in order 
to determine pneumonia and ILD but it was refused by the patient and the patient's family. Acrive treatment was 
also refused for the reasons of old age and performance status. ICU care with ventilator was re GAL eo  0ed 
but refused. He was treated with antibiotics, steroid therapy and oxygen therapy but he expired on 
due to failure of saturation maintenance. Cause of death was R/O ILD and R/O pneumonia. Lab data on 
1111.showed as: CRP 16.86 mg/dL, Hb 10.7 g/dL, Ht 31.3 %, RBC 3.67 x10A6/mm3, WBC 9.01 x10A3/mm3, PIt 60 
xleA8imm3 and Eos 0.1 %. The autopsy was not performed. 
The study investigator considered that the events were not related to pemetrexed but related to gefitinib. He 
considered that the events were not related to protocol procedure.
