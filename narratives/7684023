This clinical trial ca
metastatic lung cancer se elliillinconcerns a 66-year-old Asian male. The patient's medical history included with malignant pleural effusion and metastases to the brain diagnosed in Aug-2010, 
computerized tomography, guided lung biopsy and throacentesis in Aug 2010, and hyperglycaemia. The patient 
smoked since the age of 16. The patient's family history was positive for asthma and cirrhosis. The patient had no 
known allergies. The patient last received radiation to the brain in Aug 2010. Concomitant medications included: 
folic acid, cyancobalamin and dexamethasone as premedication, ipratropium bromide (also reported as ipratropium 
bromide /salbutamol sulfate) for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, lovastatin for hyperlipidaemia, 
hydrocodone/acetaminophen for pain, ranitidine hydrochloride for reflux, fuosemide for edema, phenytoin as an 
anticonvulsive, paracetamol for pain or fever, and dronabinol for an unspecified indication. On 27-Sep-2010, the 
patient first received pemetrexed 500 mg/m2 and carboplatin 6 AUC, both intravenously for the treatment of 
advanced non-small cell lung cancer of nonsquamous histology. The patient last received both study drugs prior to 
the event on 18-Oct-2010. On 08-Nov-2010, the patient was discon inued from the trial and taken off protocol (no 
reason specified). On 111.11111.(previously reported as )days after last receiving both study 
drugs, the patient was admitted to hospital with shortness of breath. The patient complained of increasing 
shortness of breath with coughing with yellow sputum. The patient had no fever or chills. The patient had been 
having fatigue and also decreased oral intake and appetite. The patient had been in bed most of the time. He had 
no nausea, vomiting or abdominal pain. The patient's vital signs on 41111111111111 (previously reported as_ 
11A111n1 111bwere as follows: blood pressure 78/44, respiration 18, heart rate 115 (no units or reference ranges provided). electrocardiogram (EKG) showed tachycardia with a heart rate of 115, but a review of other systems was 
normal. The patient's laboratory results included: sodium 126, potassium 4.6, chloride 89, bicarbonate 15, blood 
urea (BUN) 50, creafinine 2.92 from a baseline of 0.99, glucose 280, calcium 8.5, alkaline phosphatase (Alk Phos) 
221, total protein 6.1, albumin 3.4, aspartate aminotransferase 1597, alanine aminotransferase 128, troponin less 
than 0.01, white blood cell count (WBC) 27.4, hemoglobin (Hgb) 11.4, hematocrit (Hct) of 33.4, platelet count (Plt) 
of 429, partial carbon dioxide pressure (PCO2) 20, partial oxygen pressure (P02) 183, oxygen saturation 99.3 (no 
units or reference ranges provided) and hemoglobin A1C of 6.3. Tests to rule out pulmonary embolus, post-
obstuctive pneumonia and progression of disease were planned, and also an ultrasound of the kidneys. 
Medications administered included morphine, sodium bicarbonate for acidosis, calcium gluconate for 
hypocalcemia, vancomycin, intravenous levaquin and clindamycin for sepsis, dronabinol for appetite stimulation, 
furosemide for fluid retention, oxygen, phenytoin for brain metametastasis, norepinephrine bitartrate for 
hypotension, albuterol and ipratropium bromide nebulizer, lorazepam and mehtylprednisolone sodium succinate for 
dyspnea and insulin lispro for diabetes mellitus. On the patient was also diagnosed with acute renal 
failure and pneumonia. On the patient le . The cause of death was metastatic lung cancer. No 
autopsy was performed. At t e time of death, the patient had not recovered from the events of shortness of breath, 
acute renal failure, and pneumonia. Per the protocol, death due to disease progression is excluded from SAE 
reporting unless the investigator believes the event may have been caused by the study drug or drug delivery 
system. Additonal information has been requested. In the opinion of the investigator, the shortness of breath, acute

renal failure, and pneumonia were not related to study drugs or protocol procedures. The investigator's reported 
disease progression as an explanation of his opinion. Update 09-Feb-2011: Additional information received from 
the investigator on 07-Feb-2011 included: Cause of death, additional SAEs of acute renal failure and pneumonia, 
lab test results, additional concomitant medications, and the investigator's causality assessments.
