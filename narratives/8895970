A clinical investigator reported that a 4-year-old female patient was hospitalized due to febrile neutropenia and 
episodes of grade III mucositis while enrolled in the above mentioned trial involving dasatinib added to standard 
chemotherapy for the treatment of Philadelphia chromosome positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia. The patient 
also developed medically significant grade II allergic reaction. The patient's background chemotherapy included

FOIA Case Report Information 
The patient was receiving oral dasatinib 45 mg from 30Apr2012. The patients background chemotherapy included 
intravenous methotrexate at a high dose of 3500mg on 14Aug2012, intrathecal cytarabine at a dose of 30mg on 
14Aug2012, intravenous ifosfamide at a dose of 1120mg from 15Aug2012 to 17Aug2012, intravenous vincristine 
sulfate at a dose of 1.1 mg on 15Aug2012 and 19Aug2012, intravenous asparaginase 17500 units on 19Aug2012. 
Ten minutes after the start of asparaginase infusion the patient became pale, diaphoretic and not as responsive as 
normal. The patient was also noted to have swollen lips and pale lips. It was noted that the patient had allergic 
reaction on 19Aug2012 The event allergic reaction was assessed as medically significant. The patient was also 
noted to be hypotensive. The patient was treated with hydrocortisone and symptoms resolved on 19Aug2012, No 
action was taken regarding the study therapy due to the event of allergic reaction. HR-2 day 6, therapy with 
asparaginase was discontinued and pegaspargase was ordered to prescribe on next day of this report. The patient 
received therapy with intravenous pegaspargase at a dose of 1750 ILI on 20Aug2012.

on On the patient had temperatures of 100.4 F and 100.6 F (38 .1 degrees). On 
blood cultures drawn showed negative results. Laboratory investigations revealed the followin

The patient also received intravenous cytarabine at a dose of 2800mg from 05Sep2012 to 06Sep2012 and 30mg 
on 09Sep2012; intravenous etoposide at a dose of 140mg from 07Sep2012 to 08Sep2012, and at a dose of 70mg 
on 095ep2012; intravenous pegaspargase at 1750 ILI on 10Sep2012: intrathecal methotrexate at a dose of 12mg

at a dose of 15mg from 06Sep2012 to 09Sep2012 and at 5mg on 10Sep2012.

showed no growth till the date of the report. The patient continued to have fever u to 103.1 on and 
The patient's WBC was at 0.1 x 10E3/1JL on and 
Anti-fungal coverage was added to treatment. No action was taken regarding study t erapy. 
The patient's last fever was documented on t 100.2 Fahrenheit. Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) was

negative for any 11 111..1 1antibiotics and anti-fun al given to patie were completed on 010ct2012. The 
patient recovered from febrile neutropenia on The patient's past medical history included anemia, 
thrombocytopenia and thrush. 
Investigator's causality assessment: Mucositis (20Aug2012) was related to methotrexate but not related to dasatinib 
and assessment was not provided for ifosfamide, etoposide, daunorubicin HD, dexamethasone, cytarabine, 
asparaginase, vincristine sulfate, pegaspargase therapy and hydrocortisone. Allergic reaction was not related to 
dasatinib but related to asparaginase and assessment was not provided for ifosfamide, daunorubicin hcl, 
dexamethasone. methotrexate sodium, cyclophosphamide, cytarabine, vincristine sulfate, pegaspargase therapy. 
Febrile neutropenia (onset was certainly related to ifosfamide, methotrexate and cytarabine but not 
related to dasatinib, asparaginase, vincristine sulfate, pegaspargase therapy. Causality was not provided for 
daunorubicin HCI, dexamethasone, etoposide therapy and hydrocortisone therapy. Febrile neutropenia (onset 
was related to cytarabine, etoposide, pegaspargase, methotrexate, hydrocortisone and 
exame @sone; but not related to dasatinib therapy. Causality was not provided for ifosfamide, vincristine sulfate, 
asparaginase and daunorubicin HCI. 
BMS causality assessment: Mucositis was possibly related to methotrexate but not related to 
dasatinib and not likely related to ifosfami e, aunorubicin HCI, dexamethasone, cytarabine, asparaginase, 
vincristine sulfate, pegaspargase, etoposide and hydrocortisone therapy.

and etoposide therapy.

dexamethasone. 
BMS Medical Comment: This patient developed mucositis, allergic reaction and 2 episodes of neutropenia while on 
multiple Antineoplastic therapy including dasatinib for acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Treatment with multiple high 
dose chemotherapeutic drugs including methotrexate, ifosfamide, daunorubicin, cytarabine, asparaginase and 
vincristine possibly resulted in mucositis. A causal role of ifosfamide, methotrexate, cytarabine, asparaginase, 
vincristine, daunorubicin and pegaspargase was considered possible in first episode of neutropenia due to their 
myelosuppressive nature. High doses of etoposide, cytarabine, asparaginase and methotrexate possibly resulted in 
second episode of neutropenia. Allergic reaction occurred 10 minutes after asparaginase infusion, hence 
considered related to asparaginase and not related to other suspect drugs. Considering the events resolved without 
discontinuation of dasatinib, its causal role was considered not related in the reported events.
