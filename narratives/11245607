A physician reported that a 65-year-old male patient was diagnosed with suspected progressive multifocal 
leukoencephalopathy (PML) while receiving therapy with belatacept for the indication of prophylaxis against allograft
rejection following renal transplantation. The patient received his first renal transplant in 2013, and basiliximab for 
induction and belatacept, mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) 750 mg BID and oral corticosteroids for maintenance 
immunosuppression. The dose of MMF was lower than the approved starting dose of  500-1000 mg BID due to 
leucopenia.
The patient was diagnosed with suspected PML based on symptoms (unspecified), characteristic magnetic 
resonance imaging (MRI) findings and detection of JC virus in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) by polymerase chain 
reaction (PCR). His Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) / Cytomegalovirus (CMV) serostatus was unknown.  His 
immunosuppression was then stopped and plasmapheresis was initiated. The outcome of the PML was not 
provided.
The patient was not considered a high immunologic risk transplant recipient. He was reportedly not highly 
sensitized and did not develop detectable levels of donor specific antibody (DSA) after transplant.
He had experienced one episode of acute rejection approximately one year after transplant, that was treated with 
methylprednisolone and had been stable between the time of that episode and the present illness. Kidney 
transplant rejection was added as a serious adverse event.
Medical history included end stage renal disease secondary to immunoglobulin A (IgA) nephropathy.
An ad hoc query has been performed on 30-Jun-2015 and 01-Jul-2015; with no additional information provided at 
this time. 
BMS Medical Evaluation comment:
This 65-year-old male patient with kidney transplant received basiliximab induction and belatacept, mycophenolate 
mofetil and corticosteroids for maintenance immunosuppression, experienced one episode of acute rejection 
approximately one year post  transplant that was treated with methylprednisolone.  He then remained stable until a 
diagnosis of suspected progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) was made following the onset of 
unspecified symptoms, and identification of consistent MRI findings and JC virus in CSF. Considering that PML can
occur in patients on chronic immunosuppressive therapy for organ transplant, a role of the suspect drugs in the 
event of PML was possible.

FOIA Case Report Information
Supplemental information was received on 31-Aug-2015 from France healthy authority. Local Health Authorities ID: 
PC20150453, Regional pharmacovigilance center: PC1500457. 
The patients age was updated from 65 year old to 67 year old.  On (b) (6)  the patient received a renal 
transplant and was initiated on intravenous belatacept  (Nulojix) 5mg/kg, oral mycophenolate mofetil (Cellcept) 500 
mg twice daily, and oral prednisone (Cortancyl). 
He was diagnosed with life-threatening progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) on 26-Jun-2015 based 
on the results of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and lumbar puncture. Immunosuppressive therapy was 
discontinued. The last dose of belatacept and mycophenolate mofetil were administered on 17-Jun-2015 and 23-
Jun-2015 respectively. Despite the discontinuation of immunosuppressive therapy the patient's condition 
progressively worsened. At the time of reporting the event had not resolved. 
The patient was treated with plasma exchange and interlukin 7 (IL-7). 
According to the Pharmacovigilance center reporter and French methodology of causality assessment, the drug 
relationship was considered as "dubious" for all suspected drugs.
BMS Medical Evaluation comment:
This 67-year-old male patient underwent kidney transplant and received basiliximab, belatacept, mycophenolate 
mofetil and prednisolone. He experienced one episode of acute rejection approximately one year post  transplant 
that was treated with methylprednisolone. Approximately 20 months after initiation of therapy, the patient presented 
with neurological symptoms. Subsequently he was diagnosed with PML based on the results of MRI and JC virus in
CSF.  As a result, immunosuppressive therapy was discontinued. Despite discontinuation of immunosuppressive 
therapy the patient s condition progressively worsened. Considering that PML can occur in patients on chronic 
immunosuppressive therapy for organ transplant, a role of the suspect drugs in the event of PML is possible.
Supplemental information was received on 25-Mar-2015 from the French Healthy Authority. The patient died due to 
progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) on (b) (6)
The patient underwent a kidney transplant in (b) (6)  induction with basiliximab and prednisone, maintenance 
with belatacept, MMF and prednisone. Base creatinine was 100-120 micromol/L. The patient also had right kidney 
junction syndrome (ureteropelvic junction obstruction).
In Jan-2015, the patient had Banff grade lb acute cellular rejection that was treated with methylprednisolone. From 
2014-2015, clinical evidence of CMV reactivation (D+/R+) developed, with fever and diarrhea.  Symptoms resolved

following treatment with  valganciclovir. In Jul-2014, BK viremia was diagnosed by PCR detection of 4.6 log of viral 
DNA/mL, for which the dose of MMF was reduced to 250 mg, 3 times daily. Beginning in Jan-2015, laboratory 
evidence of cholestasis developed, in the form of liver function tests (specific test results not provided) elevated to 
twice the upper limit of normal.  Abdominal ultrasonography revealed a 5-mm segmental dilation of bile duct 
segment III due to a 2-cm diameter accumulation of gall stones. 
On admission, the patient was treated with esomeprazole, 40 mg tablets, 2 in the evening; acetylsalicylic acid, 75 
mg; sodium bicarbonate, 2 tablets 3 times daily; irbesartan, 75 mg daily; atorvastatin 10 mg daily; prednisone, 10 
mg daily;, amoxicillin-clavulanate, 1 g 3 times daily; valganciclovir, 450 mg tablets, 2 in the morning; MMF 500 mg, 
1 tablet in the morning and evening; hydroxyzine tablets, 25 mg, 1 in the evening prn insomnia; acetaminophen, 
1000 mg every 6 hours prn pain; atovaquone 750 mg/5 mL, 1 dose in the morning and evening; and  Eau de Vichy  
(one bottle daily).
From May-Jun-2015, thymic troubles  appeared, as did confusion.  On the 05-Jun-2015, in the evening, the patient 
experienced a sudden sensation of difficulty moving the right arm, associated with weakness. The following day, he
experienced  visual difficulty .  On 08-Jun-2015, he was unable to hold a fork with his right hand.  A radionuclide 
brain scan showed no anomalies. Due to the persistence of neurological signs, the patient was then transferred to 
the hospital for a suspected cerebrovascular accident. On clinical examination, the patient was well orientated to 
time and place.  Neurologic examination also demonstrated a proportional right hemimotor deficit, arm drop on the 
Barre test, and leg drop on the Mingazzini test. Cerebellar (finger-to-nose) testing demonstrated evidence of ataxia 
on the right that was probably proprioceptive in etiology (aggravated when eyes were closed); heel-to-shin testing 
was normal. There was hypoesthesia to fine touch over the right hemicorpus with a visual and right hemisensory 
deficit. There was a slight loss of words that may have been due to a language barrier?), but no dysarthria; slight 
right side facial paralysis was noted but no stato-kinetic cerebellar syndrome.
Results of laboratory evaluation:
On 19-Jun-2015, a Cerebrospinal fluid (CSR) specimen obtained by lumbar puncture revealed the following: protein
concentration, 0.33 (conventional literature reference range 0.2-0.4) g/L; glucose, was 4.2 mmol/L; and chloride, 
128 mmol/L. The CSF was acellular. Polymerase chain reaction (PCRs) for viral DNA to Cytomegalovirus (CMV), 
Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), herpes simplex virus (HSV1), HSV2, and varicella-zoster virus (VZV) were all negative; 
Chinese ink stain, negative; and Cryptococcal antigen, negative. Testing for JCV DNA by PCR was positive at 3.85 
log.  On 22-Jun-2015, a repeat lumbar puncture showed:  CSF protein concentration, 0.4 g/L;  glucose, 3.6 mmol/L;
and 2 WBCs and/or RBC s. Cell typing showed a B-cell -population comprised of 81 % lymphocytes and 19 % 
natural killer (NK) cells . The ratio of T4/T8 lymphocytes was 1.63. Testing for JCV DNA by PCR  was positive at 
4.22 log. On 13-Jul-2015, a third lumbar puncture revealed  1 WBC and 720 RBCs,  an elevated protein 
concentration of 0.51 g/L, glucose of 3.2 mmol/L and JCV DNA count of 4.16 log.

Laboratory evaluation for autoimmune disease:
Anti-nuclear (ANA) positive at a dilution of 1:80 with a speckled pattern; testing for anti-mitochondrial antibody type 
2 was, negative, as was testing for anti-LKM1, anti-LC1, anti-smooth muscle, anti-parietal cell, anti LKM1 tissue, 
anti LC1 tissue and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA). The serum IgG level was 6.2 (reference range 
(NR) 6.81 to 12.66) g/L, the serum haptoglobin was 0.75 (NR is 0.30-2.00) g/L, and the serum albumin was 39.0 
(NR 35-50) g/L. A serum protein electrophoresis was remarkable for moderate reduction in gamma globulins (7 
g/L).  Additional laboratory tests included the following:  thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), 1.65, parathyroid 
hormone (PTH), 84 (NR 14-74), prostate-specific antigen (PSA), of 1.42. Initial cell typing showed a CD4 count of 
275 /mm3 and CD8 count of 145 /mm3. Monitoring cell typing showed a CD4 count of 430 and CD8 count of 111.
There was a repartition of T, B and NK lymphocytes which were normal.There was no monoclonality of B 
lymphocytes and a normal T4/T8 ratio. Post IL7 cell typing on 08-Aug-2015 showed a CD4 count of 520 /mm3 and 
CD8 count of 200 /mm3. On that date, the serum cholesterol was 4.17 mmol/L, the serum triglycerides were 1.40 
mmol/L and the serum ferritin was 134 ug/L. Repeat testing for Viral DNA by PCR was negative for CMV; testing for
EBV was positive at a titer of 3.76 log and for BK was positive at 5.53 log.
Radiographic studies:
On the 19-Jun-2015, cerebral magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a lesion of the white matter disease 
suggestive of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy or lymphoma while taking MMF. On 06-Jul-2015, repeat 
cerebral MRI showed an increase in the severity of the PML in particular, in the sub-cortical left frontal-parietal 
region, with no product uptake. On 22-Jul-2015, repeat cerebral MRI showed further extension of the PML to the 
fibers in the U of the left frontal-parietal region, a right corona radiata acute effect, and the start of Wallerian 
degeneration in the left cortical-spinal bundle. On 06-Aug-2015, a fourth cerebral MRI showed an increase in the 
degree of involvement of the right peri-ventricular matter.There was an overall stability of the lesions of the bilateral 
frontal-parietal region, predominantly on the left, and of the corpus callosum. The examination was confounded by 
much movement artifact; no contrast was administered.
Treatment included plasmapheresis on 25-Jun-2015 and 30-Jun-2015, which were well tolerated, and i.v. infusions 
of interleukin-7 on 17-Jul-2015, 24-Jul-2015 and 31-Jul-2015. IvIG, 1 g/kg, were administered.
Despite the above therapy, clinical and radiographic evidence of disease progression persisted, along with a total 
lack of virological and immunological (anti JC lymphocytic activation) response. On 25-Aug-2015, signs of 
respiratory distress necessitated administration of supplemental oxygen; therapy with morphine was begun. On(b) (6)
(b) (6)  the patient died.
The physician reported that in summary, the patient had an infection by the JC virus responsible for a progressive 
multifocal leukoencephalopathy that developed in the presence on maintenance immunosuppression with

belatacept, mycophenolate mofetil, and prednisone following renal transplantation in (b) (6)  On 17-Jun-2015, 
the patient was administered the last dose of belatacept. Death was attributed to progressive multifocal 
leukoencephalopathy.
The patient's medical history included end stage chronic renal failure due to Berger disease (IgA nephropathy), 
maintenance hemodialysis from Aug-2012 to Oct-2013, with residual urine output of approximately 500 ml daily.
According to the Pharmacovigilance center reporter, and to the French method of imputability, the casual 
relationship was dubious for the three suspect drugs.
This case cannot be followed-up to obtain additional information, as it is an Agency report. 
Supplemental information received on 06-Apr-2016 included a French Abstract.
The last dose of mycophenolate mofetil was administered on 22-Jun-2015 (not 23-Jun-2015 as previously 
reported).
