This literature case, reported by several health care professionals, concerns a 88 years old male patient of 
unknown origin. The patient's medical history included primary central nervous system (CNS) lymphoma (PCNSL) 
with significant cormorbidities making the patient a poor candidate for high-dose methotrexate (HD-MTX). 
Concomitant medications were not provided. After declining whole brain radiation (WBXRT) the patient was 
placed on pemetrexed (unknown trade name) cycle one, 500mg/m2 triweekly, for the treatment of PCNSL, 
beginning on an unknown date along with 4mg chemotherapy drug pegfilgrastim given the day after each cycle. 
The patient received the next two cycles of pemetrexed at 600mg/m2. The patient's magnetic resonance imaging 
(MRI), had a marked reduction in tumor size after cycle two. On an unknown date, time to onset unknown, the 
patient experienced anemia and so the patient's dose of pemetrexed was reduced to 500mg/m2. The patient's MRI 
showed a complete response after the fourth cycle. Three days prior to the 6th cycle the patient was hospitalized 
due to hypotension and a urinary tract infection. The patient subsequently developed acute renal and respiratory 
failure and died. The cause of death and date of death was unknown. It was unknown if an autopsy was performed. 
No further details were provided. The outcome of the events prior to death was unknown. It was unknown what 
action was taken with pemetrexed prior to death. The authors of the article related the event of anemia to 
pemetrexed treatment. No opinion of relatedness was provided for the remaining events. Literature Citation:
