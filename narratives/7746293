This clinical trial case 
concerns a 63 year-old Caucasian male. Me ical history 
showed no contributing risk factors for reported adverse events. Concomitant medications not provided. Patient 
was pretreated with dexamethasone, vitamin B12 and folic acid. On 25Aug10 the patient first received 
necitumumab (11F8) 800 mg, pemetrexed (Alimta) 860 mg, cisplatin 129 mg, all for NSCLC, frequency and route 
of administration not provided. Prior to the event, patient last received study drug on 03Nov10 during cycle four. On 
23Nov10, the patient had lab results that showed anemia grade 3 and hypercapnic respiratory failure grade 5. On 
1111111111111,411days after receiving last dose of study therapy, patient arrived at the emergency room to receive a 
blood transfusion for anemia due to bone marrow suppression. Hemoglobin was 6.8 and MCV 95. Patient was 
admitted into the hospital. Patient had an x-ray that showed a pleural effusion. The pleural drainage was done and 
he received blood transfusion. No cytology testing was done on pleural drainage. Pleural fluid cytology was done at 
screening and malignant cells were identified. Patient was started on antibiotic therapy on the same date. Study 
therapy was held. Patient was recovering from the anemia. On MIN the patient died; patient withdrawn from 
study. No autopsy was performed and cause of death was hypercapnic respiratory failure. The cause of 
respiratory failure was the pleural effusion etiology; investigator considered progressive disease. In the opinion of 
the investigator the anemia was related to necitumumab, pemetrexed, cisplatin, and not related to protocol 
procedures. In the opinion of the investigator, hypercapnic respiratory failure was unrelated to necitumumab, 
pemetrexed, cisplatin, or protocol procedures. The cause of respiratory failure was the pleural effusion etiology; 
investigator considered progressive disease. Update 21Dec10 : Additional information received from the study 
investigator on 21Dec10. Added events of hospitalization and death; updated narrative and PSUR comments. 
Update 22Dec2010: Additional information received from the investigator on 22Dec10. Removed hospitalization 
and death as events; added cause of death and hypercapnic respiratory failure. Narrative updated. Update 
17Jan11: additional information was received from site on 12Jan11. Amended study protocol relatedness for event 
hypercapnic respiratory failure to unrelated to protocol procedures. The cause of respiratory failure was the pleural 
effusion etiology; investigato'r considered progressive disease; updated narrative. Update 26JAN2011: Additional 
information was received from study investigator 26JAN2011. Patient had no risk factors for event. Lab values 
provided. Anemia due to bone marrow suppression. Patient pretreated with dexamethasone, vitamin B12, and 
folic acid. Protocol not related to event. Weight clarified. Narrative updated. Update 18FEB2011: Additional 
information received from study investigator 16FEB2011. Confirmed cause of respiratory failure was pleural 
effusion. Performed imine screening for pleural fluid cytology . Results not provided. Confirmed event not related 
to study protocol. Narrative updated. Update 09MAR2011: Additional information received from study investigator 
on 09MAR2011. No cytology testing was done on pleural fluid. It had been tested at screening and malignant cells 
were indentified. Narrative updated. Update 28Mar11: Additional information received from study investigator on 
23Mar11. Relatedness for event hypercapnic respiratory failure to study therapy amended to not related. Case
