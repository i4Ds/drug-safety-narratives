The patient received pemetrexed (Alimta) 500 mg/m2 and gefitinib 250 mg/day for the treatment of non-small cell 
lung cancer stage IV beginning on 03-Jul-2013. Lab data on showed as: white blood cell count (WBC) 
79 (reference level: 45-85), red blood cell count (RBC) 378 (410-59 , p atlet count (Plt) 25.2 (12-38), neutrophil 
count (Neut) 69.8% (48-81), C-reactive protein (CRP) 1.45 mg/di (0.0-0.3)and lactase dehydrogenase (LDH) 217 
U/L (115-245). On 04-Sep-2013 the fourth course of the study was started. Lab data on 04-Sep-2013 showed as: 
WBC 108, RBC 398, Plt 38.8, Neut 77.8 % and LDH 250 U/L. On around 10-Sep-2013 he developed cold-like 
symptoms. On 41111.11.1) he had pyrexia of 38s degrees C. Onalliall. he visited the hospital. Chest X-ray 
revealed no findings of pneumonia. No neutropenia was noted. He was diagnosed as cold and levofloxacin was 
started. Lab data on aIIIIIIII.showed as: WBC 43, RBC 398, Plt 20.8, Neut 47.2 %, CRP 4.72 mg/di and LDH 
299 U/L. On 19-Sep-2013 he received the last doses of pemetrexed and gefitinib. On days after 
start of the study drugs, he visited the hospital because slight fever was continued and he developed dyspnoea on 
exersion even after levefloxacin was discontinued. His SpO2 was 93% with room air. Chest X-ray revealed 
increased concentration on right lung field. Pneumonitis was suspected and close examination was performed. He 
was diagnosed as pneumonitis grade 3 (interstitial pneumonia) by the result of high resolution computerised 
tomography. Steroid pulse therapy was started. Lab data on 20-Sep-2013 showed as: WBC 85, RBC 374, Plt 32.4, 
Neut 68.4 %, prothrombin time (PT) 13.8 % (8.8-12.1), INR 1.19 (0.85-1.15), CRP 10.19 mg/dl and LDH 439 U/L. 
On oxygen cannula 2L was started. SpO2 was 97-98% with oxygen. Steroid pulse was continued. 
Sul'  "orrle/trimethoprim was started. On 23-Sep-2013 oral prednisolone 45 mg was started. On 
op CT revealed traction bronchiectasis aggravated due to steroid resistant interstitial pneumonia. 
Cyclophosphamide 750 mg was started. Lab data on 11111111111) showed as: WBC 210, RBC 385, Plt 76,9, Neut 
92.2 %, PT 12.5%, INR 1.08, CRP 2.52 mg/dl and LDH 582 U/L. On - chest X-ray revealed slight 
improvement but his symptoms were unchanged. On respiratory condition was gradually aggravated. 
The second steroid pulse was performed. Subcutaneous morphine was started for palliative use of dyspnoea. 
Heparin was also started for abnormal clotting function. Lab data or- showed as: WBC 190, RBC 406, 
Plt 52.1, Neut 91.6%, PT 19.4%, INR 1.16, CRP 5.79 mg/dl and LDH 639 U/L. Lab data on 30-Sep-2013 showed 
as: WBC 228, RBC 407, Plt 36.4, Neut 94.5%, PT 13.5%, INR 1.16, CRP 4.34 mg/dl and LDH 545 U/L. Orly 
gib respiratory condition further aggravated and he was treated with subcutaneous morphine rescue dose up. On 
is consciousness level gradually decreased. At 4:58 of 41111111111111,his death was confirmed. The 
Mc11.11Wnot performed. 
The study investigator considered that the event was related to pemetrexed and gefitinib. He also considered that 
the event was related to protocol procedure.
