Medically Significant
A neurologist spontaneously reported  that a  46 year old female patient on TYSABRI (300 mg, IV, QM) for Multiple 
Sclerosis from unknown date to Jun 2014 experienced suspect PML (onset Jul 2014).  The patient received about 
60 Tysabri infusions, the last one administered in middle June 2014 (the next one was supposed to be 
administered on 14 Jul 2014 but it won't be given). The patient tested positive for JCV antibodies  in December 
2013, index: 1.89. The patient was asymptomatic. Concomitant medications and medical history were not provided.
The last MRI performed a few days before the reporting time (Jul 2014) showed new cerebellar lesions and the 
report suggested a suspect PML. On 14 Jul 2014 a lumbar puncture will be done.The outcome for the event 
suspect PML is unknown. The causality for the event of suspect PML is unknown.  TYSABRI therapy was stopped 
temporary stopped.

Update 22 Jul 2014: The treating neurologist provided follow up information.TYSABRI was confirmed as suspect 
product. The patient did not present any clinical symptoms nor signs so a routine MRI revealed suspicious findings. 
The patient underwent MRI at the following dates: 24 Feb 2014 (before the PML suspicion), 18 Jun 2014 at the time
of PML suspicion and the most recent performed in July 2014. A lumbar puncture was performed on 14 Jul 2014 
and the sample was supposed to be tested at (b) (6)  labs on 24 Jul 2014. The patient tested positive for JCV Abs 
presence (test performed on 12 Dec 2014 at (b) (6) ) and index value was 1.89. No CSF analysis were performed 
and the patient's  current location, at the reporting time, was home. 
TYSABRI  therapy was started on 5 Sep 2008 up to 12 May 2014 (63rd infusion) every 28 days IV. The patient 
didn't  experience any TYSABRI discontinuation greater than 3 months. MS was diagnosed in February 2008  with 
motor and focal symptoms such as right lower limbs hyposthenia (June 2008), left optic neuritis (July 2008) and 
right hemiface (Feb 2008). No prior immunosupressant  therapies were given. Copaxone (glatiramer acetate) was 
mentioned among the previous MS therapies: SC daily from May 2008 up to June 2008. No PLEX cycles nor 
immunoadsorption were performed. The patient has never been enrolled in any Biogen Idec or non Biogen Idec 
sponsored clinical trials.
The reported added that they have a low suspicion and they just would like to rule out PML diagnosis since 
although the patient has ever had an high disease activity, during the 63 Tysabri infusion she has always been free 
from clincial and radiologic activity.
Update 23 Jul 2014: The treating neurologist provided the MRI reports. Brain and Brainstem MRI with and without 
contrast medium administration performed on 24-Feb-2014:
"The current exam was performed through a dedicated protocol of sequences, including basal images and after 
paramagnetic contrast medium administration.
It was then compared to the previous MRI performed on 16-Sep-2013. The inflammatory lesion burden appeared 
unchanged in number and size, compared to the previous one. So still persist, beyond the typical deep aspects, 
some signs involving the cortical and subcortical areas which led to a local atrophic change, mainly visible close to 
the right central sulcus. No new confluent lesions' progression was observed. No signs of cytotoxic restrictions were
observed or visible in focal mode. After contrast medium administration, no changes were observable, ascribable to
blood brain barrier alterations due to inflammation. A minimal irregularity of the enhancement of the anterior third of 
the cerebral falx was observed and resulted unchanged at least since 2010."
Brain and brainstem MRI with and without contrast medium administration performed on 18-Jun-2014:
"The current exam was performed through a dedicated protocol of sequences, including basal images and after 
paramagnetic contrast medium administration. It was then compared to the previous MRI performed on 24-Feb-
2014.  The radiologic picture featured by multiple alterations of inflammatory origin resulted changed considering 
the occurrence of a new faded hyperintensity located in the cerebellar portions inferior to the left middle peduncle. 
In DWI just a minimal signal enhancement was observed in the above mentioned area without any other change in

the other brain portions. After contrast medium administration no increase eventually related to a blood brain barrier
alteration was observed both in the new lesion and in the other areas. The falx aspect resulted unchanged"
Brain and brainstem MRI with and without contrast medium administration performed on 11-Jul-2014
""The current exam was performed through a dedicated protocol of sequences, including basal images and after 
paramagnetic contrast medium administration.  It was then compared to the previous MRI performed on 18-Jun-
2014. The supratentorial and parenchymal findings resulted unchanged both in the cerebral falx and in the superior 
sagittal sinus. The findings in the posterior fossa confirmed the lesion recently found in the left anterior-posterior 
cerebellar hemisphere which resulted unchanged considering its appearance basal-like and the lack of 
enhancement. The DWI original signal appeared accentuated in this area; the correspondent apparent diffusion 
coefficient didn't appear perceptibly reduced. The alteration's evolution could be simply ascribable to the evolution 
of a dated inflammatory lesion. The PML diagnosis could not be definitely excluded considering the signal even if 
the area appeared atypical.
Update 28 Jul 2014:The neurologist reported that the CSF sample tested positive for the JCV DNA presence (with 
117 JCV DNA copies/ml) at(b) (6)  labs. The patient continued to be asymptomatic, she was seen by the neuroligist 
today, EDSS value was stable (1.5), last infusion of Tysabri received two month ago. The patient won't be treated 
with PLEX nor cortisteroids since the clinical condition was absolutely stable.
Update 30 Jul 2014: The case was received from the Regulatority Authority,  National Pharmacovigilance Network 
(ID: 262467) as asymptomatic PML, onset date on 18-Jun-2014. The neurologist reported, through the NPN, that 
the patient was treated with TYSABRI from 05 Sep 2008 to 12 May 2014. The outcome of the event is not 
recovered. TYSABRI was discontinued .The MRI dated 18-Jun-2014 showed a new faded hyperintensive lesion 
located in the left cerebellar portions area, not associated to any clinical symptom. Due to the suspect PML, 
natalizumab infusion scheduled on 23-Jun-2014 was suspended. An MRI was performed on 11-Jul-2014 and all 
findings were unchanged. A CSF sample was withdrawn on 14-Jul-2014 and it tested positive for JCV DNA 
presence with 117 copies/ml (results reported on 28-Jul-2014). The clinical picture continued to be free from clinical
symptoms and comparable to which one observed on 23-Jun-2014. A follow up brain MRI is scheduled on 08-Aug-
Update 08 Aug 2014:Upon internal review, Biogen Idec considers this case to be confirmed PML based on the 
positive CSF and MRI findings.
Update 11 Aug 2014: An update was received through the Regulatory Authority, National Pharmacovigilance 
Network.
The patient underwent an MRI on 08 Aug 2014  which showed an enlargement of the left cerebellar lesion along

with the appearence of multiple punctiform enhancing images. Clinically the patient, during the last days, reported 
hypoesthesia and paresthesia at the right limbs. The clinical evaluation still resulted faded: mild motor impairment 
of the right lower limb, mild sentitive deficit of the right limbs, slowed urination (EDSS: 2.5, date unk). On 11Aug 
2014 the patient underwent a basic cognition battery which didn't show any significant change. As a whole, the 
clinical conditions still remained sufficiently satisfying, even considering the radiologic picture. It's been three days 
since the patient started methylprednisolone therapy (1 g, IV) and such therapy will last in total 5 days,  then it will 
be tapered. A new MRI will be performed in three weeks.
Update 20 Nov 2014:  A report was received through the National Pharmacovigilance Network - Centro Regionale 
Lombardia (registry number not provided).  The relationship between the reaction and the drug was assessed as 
probable according to the Naranjo algorithm.
Update 28 Jan 2015: Additional information was received from a neurologist via a MS Standardized PML Data 
Collection Tool. The patient is alive, residing at home, and is not currently on any MS therapy. Karnofsky and EDSS
scores on 12 Jan 2015 were 80 (normal activity with effort; some signs or symptoms of disease) and 4.5. A brain 
MRI was performed on 12 Jan 2015 (results not provided). The patient was diagnosed with IRIS per MRI findings 
and was asymptomatic. Treatment for IRIS included methylprednisolone and prednisone (slow tapering ongoing). 
The patient has recovered form PML and has not recovered from IRIS. Causality for the events of PML and IRIS 
was assessed as related to TYSABRI.
Update 22 Jul 2015: Additional information was received from a neurologist via a MS Standardized PML Data 
Collection Tool. The patient is alive, residing at home, and is currently on preventative MS therapy, Extavia 
(interferon beta-1b) since 03 Mar 2015. Karnofsky and EDSS scores on 10 Jun 2015 were assessed as 80 (normal 
activity with effort; some signs or symptoms of disease) and 2.5. The most recent brain MRI was performed on 10 
Jun 2015 (results not provided). Per current report the patient has recovered from PML. The patient was assessed 
on 10 Jun 2015 as not recovered from IRIS. Causality for the events of PML and IRIS was assessed as related to 
TYSABRI.
