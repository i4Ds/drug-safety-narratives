Medically Significant.
A neurologist spontaneously reported that a female patient (age unknown) on TYSABRI (300 mg, IV, QM) for 
Multiple Sclerosis from unknown date to unknown date was hospitalized from (b) (6)  to an unknown date for 
suspect PML (onset unknown). The patient had been on TYSABRI for more than 2 years and a recent MRI lead to 
PML suspicion without clinical symptoms. Lumbar puncture was scheduled for (b) (6) ; CSF will be sent to the 
(b) (6)  lab for JCV testing. CSF result was pending at the time of this report. Treatment for the event was not reported.
The outcome for the event suspect PML is unknown. The causality for the event of suspect PML is unknown.  It is 
unknown if TYSABRI treatment is ongoing.
Update 21 Jun 2014: Additional information was received from the neurologist via a Biogen Idec employee (Medical
Science Liaison). The 37 year old patient was on TYSABRI (300 mg, IV, QM) for Relapse Remitting Multiple 
Sclerosis (discrepant information) for a total 78 doses of TYSABRI infusions from Nov 2006 to Apr 2007 and from 
Apr 2008 to 19 May 2014. TYSABRI was stopped temporarily from Apr 2007 to Apr 2008 due to a pregnancy. The 
suspicion of PML was based on the presence of gait ataxia and a lesion of the right ponto-cerebellar area with 
suggestive characteristics. The patient had not received any immunosuppressant and was on Avonex (interferon 
beta-1a) for 8 years from 1998 to 2006. On an unknown date, the patient tested positive for anti-JCV antibodies 
(index value 2.229). No further information was provided.
Update 07 Jul 2014: The neurologist spontaneously reported that the CSF sample tested positive for the JCV DNA 
at 4000 copies/ml at (b) (6)  labs.
Update 10 Jul 2014: Biogen Idec considers this case to be high suspect for PML based on positive CSF and 
pending additional MRI.
Update 17 Jul 2014: Additional information was received from the neurologist.  The patient was diagnosed with MS 
in 1996 and started on Avonex (interferon beta-1a) in 1997.  TYSABRI was started in 2006 and was discontinued in
Dec 2006 due to the patient wishing to become pregnant.  The patient delivered in (b) (6)  and TYSABRI was 
restared on 20 Jun 2008.  At the time of this report, the patient has received 78 TYSABRI infusions.  The patient 
has not received any past immunosuppressant therapy.  The patient tested positive for JCV antibodies with an 
index value of 2.279.  On 03 Apr 2014, the patient presented to the (b) (6)  for a visit and referenced an 
accidental fall at home.  Upon examination, she waas dysphonic and the neurologist suspected a pneumothorax.
Chest x-ray was requested, however, the result was negative.  The patient had also referenced that she had 
underwent an MRI the day before.  On 21 May 2014, the patient received the 78th infusion and dysphonia was still 
present.  On 20 Jun 2014, the patient underwent an MRI; she was ataxic, dysarthric, dysphonic, and dysphagic.
CSF tested positive for JCV DNA (4309 copies/ml).  The patient was cautiously hospitalized in the stroke unit and 
underwent two further MRIs ((b) (6)  and (b) (6) ) which showed a worsening of the area affected by PML.

The patient underwent three PLEX (plasma exchange) cycles.  At the time of the report, the patient remained 
hospitalized and fed through a nasogastric feeding tube.  She received 5 boli of cortisone and mannitol 100 mg 4 
times per day for 10 days. At the time of this report, she was receiving mefloquine 200 mg/week, mirtazapine 60 
mg/day and Seloken (metoprolol) 25 mg twice daily due to a tachycardia most likely caused by the position of the 
PML lesion.
Update 17 Jul 2014: Additional informatoin was received via regulatory report from the National Pharmacovigilance 
Network (ID 260338).  The patient tested positive for JCV Antibodies on 26-Feb-2014 (index value: 2.229). Tysabri 
therapy was stopped on 21-May-2014, when the PML suspicion came up. 11-Jun-2014 was reported as the 
reaction's onset date. On 2-Jul-2014 the CSF tested positive for JCV DNA presence (4309 copies/ml). The reaction
was treated with mefloquine 250 mg/week and mirtazapine 60 mg/day. The outcome at the reporting time was not 
recovered yet. The patient did not receive immunosuppressant therapy in the past.
Update 23 Jul 2014: The neurologist provided follow-up information and reports of the last three MRIs. Brain MRI 
with and without contrast medium administration performed on 20-Jun-2014: The exam shows a picture with 
multiple brain lesions of most likely inflammatory-demyelinating nature, mainly in supratentorial area. In addition, a 
more faded hypeintense signal in T2 was also found, that involves the bulbar-medullary junction and extends 
across the middle and inferior cerebellar peduncle, up to a part of the left cerebellar hemisphere. At the medial side 
of such lesion, a faded hyperintense signal is noticeable in T1 without any signal alteration after contrast medium 
administration. No significant areas ascribable to narrow signal diffusion are found in the analyzed area. With 
regard to the referred clinical data and anamnesis and to the MS disease, it cannot be ruled out with certainty that 
the findings may be a focus of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy nor another pathogenesis.  Further 
lesions of most likely inflammatory-demyelinating nature are found  in the spinal cord at C5 and D6-D7 segment, 
without showing any signal alteration after contrast medium administration as well. A follow up in the next future 
would be recommended.
Brain MRI with and without contrast medium administration performed on (b) (6)   The current exam, 
compared to the previous one dated 20-Jun-2014, shows a mild increase of the hyperintense signal in T2, in the 
subtentorial area that, at the current examination, involves more diffusely the right cerebellar hemisphere and the 
ponto-mesencephalic segment; essentially  the hyperintensity extension in T2 of the pontine-bulbar region resulted 
similar, with a minimal involvement of the left middle cerebellar peduncle. At supratentorial level, two new T2 
hyperintense lesions of most likely inflammatory-demyelinating nature are found in the left posterior and parietal 
post-rolandic  regions. After contrast medium administration, no enhancements are found in the area described 
above. The other findings are unchanged.

the previous one performed on (b) (6)   The large hyperintense area on T2 images is essentially unchanged in
size and as for the features of signal, located at the subtentorial level and involving the right cerebellar hemisphere, 
the ponto-mesencephalic segment and the pontine-bulbar region with involvement of the left middle cerebellar 
peduncle. The other findings resulted unchanged at basal conditions, apart from a missing visualization of a T2 
hyperintense area at the right postcentral cortical-subcortical level, noticeable in the previous exam and where, 
after contrast medium administration, the current examination shows focal enhancement. Two further punctiform 
and faded enhancements are visible in two T2 hyperintense areas, unchanged in size compared to the previous 
exam, located in the right semioval center and in the homolateral posterior parietal region. The finding are 
compatible with inflammatory demyelinating lesions in "active phase". No further pathological enhancements were 
observed in the brain.
The patient had a severe worsening of her clinical condition and at the reporting time she was transferred to the 
intensive care unit of another Hospital. 
Update 24 Jul 2014: Biogen Idec considers this case confirmed for PML based on positive CSF, positive MRI, and 
clinical symptoms.
Update 04 Aug 2014: Additional information was reported by a neurologist who reported the patient was still 
hospitalized in the intensive care unit, had a tracheostomy and the ventilar was being removed. The patient was 
feeding herself with semi-solid foods. About one week ago the patient started the treatment with Maraviroc (300 
mg, BID).
Update 14 Oct 2014: Additional information was received from the neurologist via a MS Standardized PML Data 
Collection Tool. A lumbar puncture was performed on an unspecified date and CSF was positive for JCV DNA at 
approximately 4000 copies per mL. Serum anti-JCV antibody status was positive on 26 Feb 2014. The patient's 
estimated Karnofsky and EDSS scores were assessed as follows: 80 (normal activity with effort; some signs or 
symptoms of disease) and 4 on 03 Apr 2014; EDSS 6 on 21 Apr 2014; Karnofsky score of 60 (requires occasional 
assistance, but is able to care for most of her personal needs) on 21 May 2014; and 60 and 6 on 15 Jun 2014. A 
brain MRI was performed on 03 Apr 2014 and on 19 May 2014 (results not provided). The patient was diagnosed 
with IRIS, determined by MRI findings and clinical symptoms. Treatment for IRIS was not provided. Currently, the 
patient is alive and is residing in a rehabilitation facility. As of 30 Aug 2014, the patient has recovered from PML. As 
of 03 Oct 2014, she has recovered from IRIS. Causality for the events was assessed as related to TYSABRI.
Update 19 Dec 2014: Follow-up information was received from a treating neurologist.  The patient was moved from 
the rehabilitative center to the intensive care unit one month before the reporting time (presume approximately 19 
Nov 2014).  The patient was under mechanical ventilation, through tracheotomy, and was able to breathe without

any aid for 6-7 hours per day. The patient was feeding through a nasogastric tube.  In addition, the patient 
experienced an acute acalculous cholecystitis, most likely due to the stasis. She experienced a thrombophlebitis of 
the basilic vein. She received several  blood transfusions due to a severe anemia (HGB up to 7). She was still 
under therapy with maraviroc. No worsening of the cognitive status was reported. The MRI still revealed a strong 
diffuse involvement of both hemispheres.
Update 05 Jan 2015: Follow-up information received from a treating neurologist indicated that the patient died on 
(b) (6)  at about 2PM.  During the last hospitalization in the intensive care unit the patient experienced acute 
acalculous cholecystitis with peritonitis and following septic shock. The neurologist reported that no additional 
information was at his disposal since the patient was hospitalized in a different hospital.
