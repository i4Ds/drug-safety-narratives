Medically significant
A neurologist spontaneously reported that a 38 year old male patient on TYSABRI (300 mg, IV, QM) for Multiple 
Sclerosis from unknown date to Dec 2013 is being evaluated for suspect PML (onset 07 Feb 2014). Per the 
neurologist, at the time of this report, the patient received a total of 67 doses of TYSABRI. The neurologist noted 
the patient showed behavioral symptoms along with radiologic signs. MRI on 07 Feb 2014 showed some lesions in 
the left cerebral hemisphere and in the cerebral peduncle with thalamus involvement, in the right half of the pons of 
the bulbus, in T2 sequence without any pathological enhancement, compatible with PML diagnosis. A CSF sample 
was drawn on 12 Feb 2014 and was sent to (b) (6)  lab on 13 Feb 2014. The outcome for the event suspect PML is 
unknown. The causality for the event of suspect PML is unknown.  TYSABRI therapy was discontinued.
Update 14 Feb 2014: Follow-up was provided from the National Pharmacovigilance Network (ID:237805). Updates 
were made to the patient's initial and the serious criterion. It was reported that the patient was hospitalized on an 
unknown date for suspect PML (onset 07 Feb 2014). TYSABRI was started on 15 Jan 2008. Treatment included 
TYSABRI discontinuation and 5 cycles of plasmapheresis scheduled. Concomitant medication included Tolep 
(oxcarbamazepine) 600 mg from 01 Aug 2008 to 13 Feb 2014. No further information was provided.
Update 20 Feb 2014: Additional information was received from the neurologist. The patient presented first 
symptoms of suspect PML between Sep and Oct 2013 which included confusion and irritability. The patient was 
diagnosed with MS approximately 7 years ago. No immunosuppressant history was reported. The patient's EDSS 
score in Dec 2013 was 4. The patient was tested positive with Stratify 1 test and later in Sep 2013 negative with 
Stratify 2 test with an index value of 0.28. The patient started TYSABRI approximately 67 months prior to the first 
symptoms reported. No further information was provided.
Update 24 Feb 2014: Additional information was received from the neurologist. The patient's CSF sample was 
tested positive for JCV DNA at (b) (6)  labs on an unknown date. No further information was provided.
Update 28 Feb 2014: Upon internal review, this case is considered high suspect for PML with pending MRI and 
CSF details.
Update 07 Mar 2014: Additional information was received from the neurologist. The patient experienced respiratory 
arrest (onset unknown) and high fever (onset unknown). The number of JCV DNA copies in the CSF sample was 
not available. The outcome for the events was unknown. The causality for the events was not assessed.  No further
information was provided.

National Pharmacovigilance Network. The patient was hospitalized at the intensive care unit on an unknown date 
(the reason was not provided). The patient was intubated. No further information is available.
Update 04 Apr 2014: Additional information was received from the local pharmacovigilance responsible of the 
National Pharmacovigilance Network.  The patient underwent mechanical ventilation due to breathing problem 
related to sepsis; then he developed immune reconstitution syndrome which worsened the ventilation autonomy, 
related to PML, which is under treatment. The stratify test, previously reported, were performed on two different 
serum samples and no other stratify test has been done since Nov 2013. The JCV DNA test from CSF sample 
(date unknown) showed 1307 copies/mL. The neurologist wanted to test the CSF again soon. No further 
information is available.
Update 10 Apr 2014: Upon internal review, Biogen Idec considers this case to be confirmed for PML based on the 
positive CSF, MRI findings, and clinical symptoms.
Update 28 Apr 2014: Additional information was received from the treating neurologist. The patient was diagnosed 
with MS in May 1995 characterized by dizziness and right hemiparesis. Medical history included MS relapse in 
1997, 1998, 1999, 2003, 2007 and epilepsy diagnosed in May 2005. Past medication included Rebif (44 ug, TIW) 
(interferon beta-1a) from Apr 2004 to Dec 2005 and (22 ug, TIW) from Jan 2006 to Sep 2007. Concomitant 
medication included oxacarbamazepine for epilepsy. TYSABRI therapy (300 mg, IV, QM) started from Jan 2008 to 
Oct 2012 and (300 mg, IV, every 45 days) from Dec 2012 to Dec 2013. The patient received a total of 67 doses of 
TYSABRI infusion. The patient experienced progressive motor impairment in the left lower limb since Oct 2013, 
initially attributed to MS progression; then disequilibrium and cognitive and behavioural disorders appeared leading 
to PML suspect. Patient restricted to wheelchair, and experienced reduction of cognitive functions, internuclear 
ophtalmoplegia, dysarthria and choreic arms movements. Clinical worsening was observed in the following 4-6 
weeks due to the overlapping of sepsis and IRIS. The patient underwent tracheostomy and mechanical ventilation. 
At the time of this report, the patient was stabilized and slowly recovering. He was breathing spontaneously but had 
severe quadriparesis. He began rehabilitation. The patient was tested positive for anti JCV antibodies in Sep 2011. 
Brain MRI in Nov 2013 showed new irregular T2 lesions in the left side of cerebellum, in the right diencephalum 
with extension of basal ganglia, and periventricular, without contrast enhancement. MRI on 07 Feb 2014 showed a 
marked extension of the above mentioned lesions with a wide involvement of pons and medulla, still without Gd 
enhancement. Serial MRI showed the development of an immune reconstitution syndrome (IRIS), currently in 
remission with steroid treatment. Additional treatments included plasma-exchange, meflochine, mirtazapine and 
methylprednisolone. No further information was provided.
Update 22 May 2014: Additional information was received from a physician via a Biogen Idec employee (Medical 
Science Liaison) that Stratify test was done on 10 Feb 2014 and the patient was tested positive with an index value

of 3.0207. The detection of JCV antibodies in the CSF was not performed. The patient underwent 5 PLEX cycles in 
Feb 2014. No further information was provided.
Update 04 Jun 2014: The treating physician reported that the patient was undergoing rehabilitation at the time of 
this report and the patient could walk with crutches. No further information was provided.
Update 02 Jul 2014: Additional information was received via the MSL, was tested negative for anti-JCV antibodies 
(index value 0.28) on an unknown date.
Update 28 Aug 2015: Additional information was provided from the neurologist via the Biogen Medical Science 
Liaison.  The patient was still hospitalized in a rehabilitation facility, and was not autonomous.  The EDSS was 
unchanged with respect to previously reported EDSS (presume previously reported EDSS of 4).  A new MRI was 
performed (presume Aug 2015) which was stable with respect to previous MRI's; no lesions with contrast agent 
uptake were detected.  No further information provided.
Update 22 Sep 2015:  Additional information was provided by a different clinician.  The patient did not want to be 
followed up at their center and as a result the patient has been lost to follow-up for 6 months.  The clinician was not 
aware of any MRI's performed.  An indirect source informed the clinician that the patient was alive and at home, but
it did not seem that the patient's disabilities improved.  As the clinician was unable to obtain additional information, 
the 12 month PML Data Collection Form was not going to be completed.  No further information provided.
