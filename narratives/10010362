Medically Significant
A medical doctor reported via Medical Science Liaison Manager that a  41 year old female patient on TYSABRI 
(300 mg, IV, QM) for relapsing remitting Multiple Sclerosis from 14 Mar 2008 to 03 Jan 2014 was hospitalized from 
(b) (6)  to an unknown date for suspicion of PML (onset (b) (6) ). The patient tested anti-JCV-antibody 
positive on 11 Jul 2011.  In 2005, the patient had been treated with azathioprine for a few weeks.  The azathioprine 
was withdrawn due to drug intolerance.  Medical history included RRMS and migraine.  The patient had previously 
been in (b) (6)  at site (b) (6)  subject ID (b) (6)  The patient has received 74 TYSABRI infusions.  On (b)(6)  
(b) (6)  a MRI of the brain was suspicious for PML.  Cerebrospinal fluid was taken on(b) (6)  and sent to 
the laboratory with results pending.  The patient was asymptomatic.  At time of event the patient had not been on 
any concomitant medication.  Treatment included mefloquine 250 mg PO since (b) (6)  and mirtazapine 20

mg PO since (b) (6)  for suspicion of PML. The event of suspicion of PML is ongoing. The causality for the 
event of suspicion of PML was assessed as related.  TYSABRI therapy was previously discontinued 8 weeks prior 
on 03 Jan 2014.
Update 06 Mar 2014:  The neurologist reported via Medical Science Liaison that the diagnosis of PML had been 
confirmed. The result of the JCV PCR in CSF was 240 copies/mL.  The testing information was verbally reported 
the written report has not been received by the office.  No further information was reported.
Update 10 Mar 2014:  The neurologist spontaneously reported that the patient's missed TYSABRI infusion on 31 
Jan 2014 was due to organizational reason. The patient refused to wait and left the outpatient infusion center. 
Thereafter, the neurologist decided to skip this infusion and scheduled the next TYSABRI infusion on(b) (6)  
(b) (6)  On this date, TYSABRI was not administered due to MRI findings.  The neurologist provided two MRI 
reports.  The first report of a MRI brain native scan, without contrast medium because of poor venous access, on 
(b) (6)  was done for routine monitoring under TYSABRI treatment in order to identify possible progression of 
MS, floridity or signs of PML.  Compared to a previous MRI from 17 Jul 2013 it showed in FLAIR and T2 sequences
an extended diffuse hyperintense lesion in frontoparietal white matter on the left side. The U-fibers were left out. 
The signal intensity reached from the frontoparietal cortex to the left lateral ventricle. A U-shaped subcortical signal 
intensity over 1.5 cm was marked out occipital on the left side. Further subcortical signal intensities were seen 
frontal on the right side. In comparison to the previous scan, a patchy hyperintensitiy in FLAIR was detected in 
pedunculus cerebri extended on colliculus superior on the left side.  Other post-inflammatory lesions remained 
unchanged compared to the previous scan. Both lateral ventricles were symmetrical and not enlarged. CSF spaces
normal, no circulatory dysfunction.  The overall conclusion was the findings were consistent with PML.  The second 
report of a MRI brain with contrast medium performed on (b) (6)  In comparison to the previous scan from(b)(6)
(b) (6)  there was a pronounced T2w-hyperintensitiy frontal on the left side in addition to significantly less marked
subcortical T2w-hyperintensity parieto-occipital on the left side and frontal on the right side. The mesencephalic 
T2w-hyperintensity showed in comparison to the previous scan no changes. In T1W sequence there was no 
contrast enhancement of above-mentioned supratentorial and mesencephalic lesions. No further contrast-
enhancing lesions, no florid MS lesions, no intra-axial space-occupying lesions. The findings supported the 
diagnosis of suspected PML.   No further information was reported. 
Update 11 Mar 2014: The neurologist reported that JCV DNA PCR test in CSF was positive with 480 copies/ml 
(previously reported as 240 copies/mL)  No further information was reported.
Update 13 Mar 2014:  Upon internal review this case was considered to be confirmed for PML based on positive 
CSF and MRI findings.

FOIA Case Report Information
Update 08 Apr 2014:  Additional information was received from the neurologist via a MS Standardized PML Data 
Collection Tool and email. The patient is alive and currently in an intensive care unit (ICU). The neurologist 
assessed the patient?s current clinical status as follows: the patient is in ICU for IRIS.  The neurologist assessed 
the patient?s estimated Karnofsky and EDSS scores on 14 Mar 2008 to be 90 (able to carry on normal activity; 
minor signs or symptoms of disease) and 3.0.  The neurologist assessed the patient?s estimated Karnofsky and 
EDSS scores on 29 Nov 2013 to be 90 (able to carry on normal activity; minor signs or symptoms of disease) and 
1.5. The neurologist assessed the patient?s estimated Karnofsky and EDSS scores on (b) (6)  to be 90 (able 
to carry on normal activity; minor signs or symptoms of disease) and 1.5. On (b) (6)  the patient underwent a 
lumbar puncture with results reported as positive for CSF JCV DNA at 480 copies per mL.  No additional lumbar 
punctures have been done. The patient has not recovered from PML. The outcome is unknown for IRIS. Causality 
for the event of PML was assessed as related to TYSABRI. Causality was not assessed for the event of IRIS.
Update 03 Nov 2014: Additional information was received from the neurologist via a MS Standardized PML Data 
Collection Tool. The patient is alive, residing at home, and is not currently on any MS therapy. The patient was 
diagnosed with IRIS, which was determined by clinical symptoms and MRI findings. Clinical symptoms began in 
Mar 2014 and included disturbed memory and reduced consciousness (cognitive/behavioral), hemiparesis (focal 
motor), aphasia (speech), diplopia (visual), and gait ataxia (cerebellar). The patient was treated with 
methylprednisolone as follows: 500 mg IV daily from 21 Mar to 23 Mar 2014 and from 27 Mar to 29 Mar 2014; and 
1000 mg IV daily from 03 Apr to 05 Apr 2014 and from 10 Apr to 13 Apr 2014. On 10 Jun 2014 the patient had a 
lymphocyte count of 1.87 /nL (normal range 0.7-4.6 /nL). On 08 Jul 2014, the patient had a leukocyte count of 7.8 
/nL (normal range 4-11 /nL). The neurologist assessed the patient?s estimated Karnofsky and EDSS scores on 09 
Oct 2014 to be 50 (requires considerable assistance and frequent medical care) and 6.0. A brain MRI was 
performed on 23 Oct 2014 (results not provided). As of 23 Oct 2014, the patient has recovered from PML and has 
recovered from IRIS. Causality for the events was assessed as related to TYSABRI.
Update 10 Apr 2015: Additional information was received from the neurologist via a Standardized MS PML Data 
Collection Tool. The patient is alive, residing at home, and currently on Copaxone (started 09 Feb 2015) for clinical 
relapse and radiological evidence of return of MS. The neurologist assessed the patient?s estimated Karnofsky and
EDSS scores on 03 Feb 2015 to be 60 (requires occasional assistance, but is able to care for most of her personal 
needs) and 6.0. A brain MRI was performed on 04 Feb 2015 (results not reported). As of 03 Feb 2015, the patient 
has recovered from PML and has recovered from IRIS. Causality for the events was assessed as related to 
TYSABRI.
