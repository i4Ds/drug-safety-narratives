This spontaneous report was received from the mother of an 11 year old Caucasian female regarding Ibuprofen 
200 mg/Diphenhydramine Citrate 38 mg Tablets. The child was given a single 1/4 tablet on 29NOV2015 for 
sleeplessness and foot pain.  On 29NOV2015, the child began experiencing hallucinations, heart palpitations, 
bloodshot eyes, and she could not sleep. The mother further described the hallucinations as the child thought her 
hand was ten times the size of her body and it was almost like she was tripping on acid. After approximately 10 or 
12 hours, the sleeplessness resolved and the child was able to sleep. On 30NOV2015, the child began feeling dizzy
which resolved at approximately 1600 on 30NOV2015. The mother contacted the childs physician and was 
reportedly informed that the events were not an allergic reaction. In follow up obtained on 01DEC2015, the mother 
reported that the heart palpitations had improved; she had not specified whether the hallucinations or bloodshot 
eyes continued. No further information is expected.
