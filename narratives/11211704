Medically Significant
A medical doctor spontaneously reported via a Biogen employee (medical science liaison) that a patient (the 
patient's identifier was not provided) on TYSABRI (300 mg, IV, QM) for an unknown indication from unknown date 
to unknown date experienced suspect PML (onset unknown). It was reported that the result of CSF JCV DNA testig
was approximate 500,000 copies. The outcome for the event suspect PML is unknown. The causality for the event 
of suspect PML is unknown.  It is unknown if TYSABRI treatment is ongoing.
Update 08 Jun 2015: On the same day of the intial report, the same medical doctor reported via an area business 
manager that the female patient enrolled in a Biogen sponsored marketing program of Monitored Therapy 
experienced changes in mental status (presumed as symptoms of suspected PML). The patient had a MRI  and a

spinal tap done which showed positive for JCV (presumed in reference to JCV DNA). No further information was 
provided.
09 Jun 2015: In response to an outbound call, a health care professional from the medical doctor's office provided 
the patient's identifier. At the time of this report, the 60 year old patient had received a total of 83 doses of TYSABRI
infusion from 20 Mar 2008 to 13 May 2015. Previous MS therapy included Copaxone (glatiramer) from Apr 2005 to 
26 Jan 2008. The patient was JCV antibody positive, with the last test on 18 Dec 2013 with an index of 4.66. The 
patient experienced aphasia-type symptoms starting 08 Apr 2015, progressively worsened. Head MRI (with and 
without contrast) on 11 Sep 2014 in comparison to 24 Feb 2014 showed there is a focus of increased signal 
intensity in the subcortical white matter of the right frontal lobe. Also seen, abnormal signal intensity involving the 
sub-ependymal white matter along the occipital horn of the right lateral ventricle. These areas of abnormal signal 
intensity were present on prior studies and are unchanged. There are some very subtle tiny foci of increased signal 
intensity in the subcortical white matter of the left parietal lobe - also present previously unchanged. There is a 
small focus of increased signal intensity seen in the subcortical white matter of the left frontal lobe (measures 
approximate 2 mm) which is not seen with absolute certainty on the previous studies. It's possible it may have been
present previously and not visualized due to its small size and differences in angulation of the images; however, the
possibility of new focus of white matter abnormality cannot be absolutely excluded. No other foci of increased signal
intensity suggestive of new lesions. No contrast enhancement or restricted diffusion was seen. Head MRI (with and 
without contrast) on 04 May 2015 showed There are foci of abnormal signal intensity seen within the white matter of
the left frontal and parietal lobes. The small focus of increased signal intensity in the more anterior aspect of the left
frontal lobe was present on the prior study and is not changed. There are at least two, likely three, new larger white 
matter lesions seen. One of these is in the posterior left frontal white matter. This lesion measures approximately 
1.9 cm in size. The other views and is in the left parietal white matter. This lesion has an irregular shape and also 
extends into and involves the posterior body of the corpus callosum on the left side. The size of this lesion is difficult
to measure due to its irregular shaped and extension into the posterior aspect of the corpus callosum. This lesion is
over 2 cm in length. There is also a small lesion within the splenium of the corpus callosum which is not seen on 
the patient's prior study. These lesions do not show contrast enhancement. These lesions presumably represent 
progression of the patient's demyelinating disease since prior study   of chronic ischemia but less likely. 
Impression: progression of demyelinating disease. Head MRI (with and without contrast) on 30 May 2015 in 
comparison to 04 May 2015, 11 Sep 2014, 24 Feb 2014, 07 May 2012, 28 Feb 2011, 16 Oct 2007, 03 Mar 2005, 20
Mar 2012, 29 May 2009 showed new areas of signal alteration identified in the posterior left frontal and the left 
parietal as well as the right parietal location. This may also involve portions of the posterior aspect the corpus 
callosum. This appears more distinct and prominent compared to most  recent prior exam. This has significantly 
progressed when compared most recent prior exam given differences in technique. One of the larger regions 
measures at least 2.8 om in greatest axial dimensions. Accurate size dimensions are difficult to assess given 
morphology. Post-contrast images demonstrate no definite areas of enhancement. There is no abnormal intra or

collections identified in the midline structures are nodular fluid auspicious extra-axial not displaced. Findings are 
consistent with history of progressive  MS, however other etiologies such as underlying lesion/neoplasia such as 
lymphoma or primary neoplasm of the brain or infection cannot be excluded and correlation clinically and possibly 
with CSF studies may be useful. The head MRI on 30 May 2015 led to PML suspicion.  Head MRI (with and without
contrast) on (b) (6)  in comparison to MRI dated 30 May 2015 showed: again seen of the signal alterations 
within the left frontal parietal lobe and posterior corpus callosum compatible with demyelinating plaques which 
appear stable from recent study. The cerebellum the visualized brainstem are normal in appearance. Additional 
mild periventricular white matter changes are seen suggestive accompanying chronic small vessel ischemic 
disease. No abnormal enhancement is seen. There is no evidence of acute ischemic change or bleed. The 
ventricles and extraaxial fluid spaces are normal in size and configuration.  IMPRESSION: Extensive, although 
stable demyelinating plaques within the left frontal parietal lobes and posterior corpus callosum. CSF collected on 
(b) (6)  was tested at (b) (6)  and returned positive with 533991 copies/ml. The patient was hospitalized since 
(b) (6)  and remained hospitalized at the time of this report. PLEX was planned, however, patient has bad 
veins could not get access, so a port was being placed. PLEX was scheduled to start on (b) (6)  once port is 
all set.
UIpdate 18 Jun 2015: Upon internal review, this case was confirmed for PML based on clincal presentation, positive
CSF and radiologic evidence.
Update 18 Jun 2015: A registered nurse spontaneously reported that the patient was diagnosed with MS 
complicated by PML related to TYSABRI. The patient was hospitalized from (b) (6)  to (b) (6)  and 
transferred to another hospital under a different doctor's care. The symptoms that the patient experienced included 
dysphagia, dysarthria, gait and language dysfunction,and hemiparesis. Chronic inflammatory demyelinating 
polyneuropathy (CIDP) was considered as secondary diagnosis. The patient was treated with IVIG, 3 days of Solu-
medrol (methylprednisolone) prior to hospitalization and was treated with plasmapheresis for PML.
Update 19 Jun 2015: The prescribing neurologist reported via MS TOUCH prescribing program discontinuation 
questionnaire that the patient experienced PML. The patient has been tested positive for anti JCV antibodies since 
26 Mar 2015. TYSABRI therapy was discontinued with the last dose administered on 13 May 2015.
Update 23 Jun 2015:  A CD containing MRI images from 28 Feb 2011, 20 Mar 2012, 07 May 2012, 24 Feb 2014, 
11 Sep 2014, 04 May 2015, 30 May 2015, and (b) (6)  was received by Biogen.
Update 22 Jun 2015:  The neurologist reported via a MS TOUCH Prescribing Program form (TYSABRI Initial 
Discontinuation Questionnaire) that the patient tested positive for anti-JCV antibodies since 26 Mar 2015.

three months. A brain biopsy has not been performed.  The patient has not received prior immunosuppressant 
therapy. The patient received the following immunomodulatory therapy: Copaxone from 2005 to 2008. The patient 
has been treated with Plasma Exchange (PLEX) - number of sessions and dates were not provided. The patient

FOIA Case Report Information
Update 29 Jul 2015: Follow-up information received from a consulting physician reported that the patient has been 
"remarkably stable since transfer" to their hospital and she remains stable/improving. IRIS has started which was 
noted to signify that her immune system is responding to the virus and was noted as a positive sign. Causality for 
the event of IRIS was not assessed.
