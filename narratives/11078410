A neurologist spontaneously reported via Biogen Employee (MSL, Medical Science Liaison) that a 33 year old male 
patient on TYSABRI (300 mg, IV, QM) for Multiple Sclerosis from unknown date to unknown date experienced 
suspected PML (onset unknown). In Apr 2015, laboratory testing included positive CSF PCR. The treatment for the 
event of suspect PML was PLEX (plasma exchange). The patient was asymptomatic at the time of this report. The 
outcome and causality for the event suspected PML is unknown.  It is unknown if TYSABRI treatment is ongoing.
Update 17 Apr 2015: Upon follow-up, the neurologist reported that the CSF results were positive but not 
quantifiable as it was <30 copies. Patient would be undergoing a second lumbar puncture. At the time of this report,
the patient was still asymptomatic and was finishing PLEX. An MRI showed a focal presentation. 
Update 28 Apr 2015: The neurologist reported additional information via a Suspect PML Data Collection Form.
Multiple Sclerosis was diagnosed on 05 Jun 2000 and the patient was clinically normal. The patient has not 
received any prior immunosuppressant therapy. The patient has received immunomodulatory therapy with

Betaseron (8 mIU, SC, TIW) from Jun 2000 to 24 Sep 2009. There has been no interruption of the suspect product 
for greater than 3 months. The patient is being evaluated for PML as a routine MRI performed on 17 Mar 2015 
revealed suspicious findings, but the patient is asymptomatic. On (b) (6)  and (b) (6)  the patient 
underwent lumbar puncture and CSF JCV DNA testing results were positive with <30 copies/ml. The patient was 
tested positive for anti-JCV antibodies on 12 Mar 2013 (index value 2.847), positive on 19 Nov 2013 (index value 
not available), positive on 11 Mar 2014 (index value 3.014), positive on 23 Sep 2014 (index value 3.371), positive 
on 10 Mar 2015 (index value 2.59). Brain biopsy has not been performed. CSF protein was abnormal and elevated 
to 0.7. Prior to starting TYSABRI, on 24 Sep 2009, the leukocyte count was 5.7 (reference range 4-11) and 
lymphocyte count was 1.75 (reference range 1-4). Prior to PML suspicion, on 10 Mar 2015, leukocyte count was 6.9
(reference range 4-11) and lymphocyte count was 2.97 (reference range 1-4). At the time of PML suspicion, on (b)  
(b) (6)  the leukocyte count was 8.5 and lymphocyte count was 2.7. On 5 Nov 2014, an MRI was performed prior 
to suspected PML diagnosis, results not provided.  The patient has not been enrolled in a Biogen or non-Biogen 
clinical trial. The patient received 5 sessions of PLEX (plasma exchange) in (b) (6)  Treatment for PML included 
Mefloquine (250 mg, PO) from (b) (6)  and Lovan (fluoxetine) (dosing information not provided). The patient is
currently in hospital.
Update 10 Jun 2015: The patient spontaneously reported via a support nurse that TYSABRI was discontinued 
approximately in Apr 2015 and had received plasma exchange for PML. The patient noted that he has tried 
Copaxone (glatiramer) but did not continue due to "side effects" (NOS). The patient noted that he was ready to start
Plegridy (peginterferon beta-1a) on the titration doses during the same week of this report. No further information 
was provided.
Update 09 Jul 2015: Upon internal review, Biogen considers this case to be final call for high suspect PML based 
on positive CSF. The lack of MRI data (radiological evidence) was because the patient refuses to consent to 
release such information. This case will be closed and no additional follow-up is expected.
