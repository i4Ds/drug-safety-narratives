This literature case, reported by a physician, concerns an adult patient of unknown gender and origin. Medical 
history included: locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and failure of first line anti-
cancer treatment. The patient had adequate hematologic, hepatic, renal and cardiac function. Concomitant 
medications included: cyanocobalamin, folic acid and dexamethasone as premedication. This literature article 
assessed the efficacy of vandetanib plus pemetrexed as second line therapy in advanced non-small cell lung 
cancer. The patient in this literature article received treatment with pemetrexed (unknown manufacturer) 500 
mg/m2, in combination with vandetanib 100 mg/d or oral placebo, every 21 days, intravenously, for treatment of 
advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer. Start date was not provided. On an unknown date, the patient 
died due to hemotysis. Corrective treatment provided, whether an autopsy had been carried out, and whether 
pemetrexed treatment was continuing until death, was unknown. In the opinion of the reporter, treatment with 
pemetrexed was related to the event. Literature Citation: de Boer RH. Arrieta 0. Yang CH. Gottfried M. Chan V.
