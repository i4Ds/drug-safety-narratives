Medically Significant
A neurologist spontaneously reported that an adult female patient on TYSABRI (300 mg, IV, QM) for Multiple 
Sclerosis from 2009 to unknown date experienced possible PML c/b medullary syndrome with motor and sensory 
deficit on right lower limb and sphincter disorders (onset 2014). The patient was treated with TYSABRI for 5 years 
and, recently, she developed medullary syndrome with motor and sensory deficit on right lower limb and sphincter 
disorders. Testing included the patient being JC (presume JCV blood test) positive (date unknown). An MRI 
performed on 10 Oct 2014 revealed new T2 lesions, which were Gd-. A lumbar puncture was performed on 20 Oct 
2014 and a sample was sent to a local hospital for CSF JCV PCR testing. The remaining sample could be analyzed
by (b) (6)  The outcome for the event is unknown. Causality for the event is unknown. It is unknown if TYSABRI 
treatment is ongoing. French Imputability: C1S1I1.
Update 31 Oct 2014: A neurologist spontaneously reported that the female patient on TYSABRI for 5 years had 
CSF JCV DNA (local lab) testing on 20 Oct 2014, which returned undetectable. The neurologist suspects a MS 
relapse (onset unknown) due to the results of JCV dosage in the CSF, the medullary location of the lesion 
(presume reference to 10 Oct 2014 MRI), and the stable clinical state of the patient. French Imputability: C1S1I1.
