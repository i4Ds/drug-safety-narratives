Medically Significant
This case, received from the French Health Authorities via the CRPV of Lyon (Local number: LY20140719), 
concerns a 32 year old female patient on TYSABRI (300 mg, IV, QM) for relapsing remitting Multiple Sclerosis from 
Dec 2010 to 25 Apr 2014 who was diagnosed with PML [progressive multifocal leukoencephalopath] (onset 25 Apr 
2014) found on routine MRI . The patient was diagnosed with MSRR [relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis] in 2005 
and was previously treated with AVONEX for 5 years. The most recent TYSABRI infusion was administered on 15 
Apr 2014; this was the patient's 41st TYSABRI infusion. Concomitant medications included Lyrica (pregabalin) and 
Cymbalta (duloxetine). The patient was tested for JC virus antibodies (Nov 2011) and results at the limit of 
detection threshold with an index of 2.15 was reported. Despite the JC virus seropositivity, [TYSABRI] treatment 
continued due to good efficiency. On 25 Apr 2014, the patient was asymptomatic but PML was detected on a

routine MRI. MRI results showed discrete subcortical hyper-intense FLAIR signal at pre-central frontal bilateral 
circonvulsions to upper part more marked at left. No recent ischemic lesions and no other abnormality were 
detected.  On 02 May 2014, a lumbar puncture was performed and JCV PCR testing results were positive at 2 
copies per mL (unknown what laboratory CSF JCV PCR performed). No plasma exchange was reported. The 
patient is under clinical and MRI monitoring. The event of PML is ongoing. The causality for the event of PML was 
assessed as possibly related.  TYSABRI therapy was discontinued. French Imputability: C2S3I3
Update 21 Aug 2014: Upon internal review, this case has been confirmed for PML based on positive JCV DNA and 
consistent detailed MRI findings.
Update 25 Aug 2014: Follow-up received from the French Health Authorities via the CRPV of Lyon (local number: 
LY20141088 and LY20140719) reported that the female patient on TYSABRI was hospitalized from (b) (6)  to 
unknown date for IRIS (onset 2014) and epilepsy (onset 22 Jul 2014). The only concomitant medication reported 
was Lyrica (pregabalin). The patient, who had received her 41st infusion of TYSABRI on 15 Apr 2014, had been 
asymptomatic and was positive with JC virus. On(b) (6)  the patient was hospitalized for rapid worsening of 
neurological disorders with ataxia increased and spasticity in the left leg, then spastic tetraparesis and sphincter 
disorders. No vigilance disorder. A new cerebral MRI (date unknown) revealed an extension of frontal PML lesions 
with punctiform and diffuse linear contrast enhancements which suggested IRIS. The spinal MRI (date unknown) 
was normal. On(b) (6)  IRIS signs were worsened with seizures of frontal origin. There was no sign of 
reactivation of MS. Corticotherapy (NOS) was started with a bolus of 1g/day for three days, then 500 mg/day for 
three days, then 1 mg/kg. On (b) (6)  an improvement was observed. The outcome of the events IRIS and 
epilepsy is unknown. French Imputability: C2S2I2.
Update 12 Sep 2014: A neurologist spontaneously reported via a Biogen Idec sales representative that the female 
patient was switched from TYSABRI to Tecfidera for 3 months (dates of therapy not provided). At the time of this 
report, the neurologist stated that the patient was doing well. No further information was provided. French 
Imputability unchanged: C2S2I2.
Update 07 Oct 2014: Additional information was received, via a Biogen Idec Account Business Manager and 
Medical Science Liaison, from a dissertation: Grosset-Janin C. A retrospective study of 13 patients who developed 
progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy under natalizumab: clinical and radiological. The dissertation was 
presented at University of Toulouse, France, on 02 Oct 2014. The author presented 13 cases of PML from two 
university hospitals. The diagnosis of PML was made or suspected between Dec 2009 and Jun 2014. Patient 
information was collected from medical records that were reviewed retrospectively from the hospital databases. 
The article reported that the female patient(b)(6)  identified as case 2014BI055443 was diagnosed with multiple 
sclerosis in 2005 at the age of  24. The neurologist assessed the event of PML as confirmed. JCV PCR in CSF was

12 copies. At the time of PML diagnosis, the patient was 33 year old and MS was evolving for 9 years. TYSABRI 
was started 5 years after MS was diagnosed and was ongoing at the time of PML. The patient had received 41 
infusions. JCV serology was positive. The patient had not received any immunosuppressive agent before TYSABRI
and had 2 risk factors for the event. French Imputability: C2S2I2
Update 08 Apr 2015: 
Additional information was received from a neurologist via a Standardized MS PML Data Collection Tool. The 
patient is alive, residing at home, and is currently on Copaxone (glatiramer acetate) for radiologic evidence of return
of MS activity and preventative MS therapy. On 15 Mar 2015, the neurologist assessed the patient's estimated 
Karnofsky and EDSS scores to be 50 (requires considerable assistance and frequent medical care) and 6.0. On 02 
Mar 2015, a brain MRI was performed (results not reported). Post-PML test results were reported as follows (date 
unspecified): leukocyte count 13 G/L; relative lymphocyte count 13.5%; absolute lymphocyte count 1.76 G/L 
(normal range 1.20 - 4.0). Additional IRIS symptoms (also reported as PML related symptoms) included drowsiness
(cognitive/behavioral), tetraplegia and spasticity (motor: multifocal), and blurred speech with an onset date of Jul 
2014. It was also reported that the focal seizures was a symptom of IRIS. Methylprednisolone was administered for 
treatment of IRIS as follows: 1 GM IV daily from 22 Jul 2014 to 24 Jul 2014, 500 mg IV daily from 25 Jul 2014 to 27 
Jul 2014, 250 mg IV daily from 28 Jul 2014 to 30 Jul 2014, and 60 mg PO daily from 31 Jul 2014 for three months. 
As of 15 Mar 2015, the patient has not recovered from PML. As of 18 Sep 2014, the patient has recovered from 
IRIS. Causality for the events of PML and IRIS was assessed as related to TYSABRI.  French Imputability: C2S2I2
Update 12 Jun 2015: Additional information was received from a neurologist via a Standardized MS PML Data 
Collection Tool. The patient is alive, residing at home, and is currently on Copaxone (glatiramer acetate) for 
radiologic evidence of return of MS activity and preventative MS therapy. On 04 Jun 2015, the neurologist assessed
the patient's estimated Karnofsky and EDSS scores to be 70 (cares for self; unable to carry on normal activity or to 
do active work) and 6.0.  A brain MRI was performed on 04 Jun 2015 (results not reported). As of 04 Jun 2015, the 
patient has not recovered from PML. As of 18 Sep 2014, the patient has recovered from IRIS. Causality for the 
events of PML and IRIS was assessed as related to TYSABRI.  French Imputability: C2S2I2.
