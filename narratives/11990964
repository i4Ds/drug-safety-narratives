This solicited case was received on 24-Jan-2016 from patient's mother via rare disease home infusion program.
Patient ID: (b) (6)  Country: Canada
This case concerns a 10 year old female patient who was receiving treatment with laronidase (Aldurazyme) and 
later had bilateral carpal tunnel surgery, hoarse voice, flat affect, achiness, fatigue, temperature 38.4 Celsius and 
intermittent dry cough.
The medical history of the patient was significant for umbilical hernia repair. No past drugs or concurrent condition 
was reported. The concomitant medications were ibuprofen, diphenhydramine hydrochloride (Benadryl) and 
lidocaine/prilocaine (Emla) as premedication.
On 10-May-2013, the patient initiated treatment with laronidase via intravenous drip, concentrate for solution for 
infusion, at a dose of 0.58 mg/kg (14.5 mg), every other week (batch/ lot number: M4004Y23; expiry date: May-
2017) for mucopolysaccharidosis I. on an unknown date, the patient began home infusion and a 0.2 micron in-line 
filter was used during the infusion. The number of home infusions received was unknown. On 17-Jan-2016, the 
patient received the last dose of laronidase prior to event onset. On 18-Jan-2016, the patient had bilateral carpal 
tunnel surgery (mild). It was reported that the patient tolerated the procedure well and was recuperating at home. 
On 24-Jan-2016, the patient woke up with a mild hoarse voice, mild intermittent dry cough, and had a mild flat 
affect. The lungs were clear, temperature was mild 38.4 degree Celsius, with mild achiness and fatigue. The same 
day, the infusion was cancelled, given patient's recent surgery and new symptoms. It was unknown if similar events
were reported in hospital setting. There was no medication error explaining the events.
