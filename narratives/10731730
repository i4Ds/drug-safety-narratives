AER 1524664 is a spontaneous case, received on 30/Jun/2011 from six lawyers and concerns a 74 year old female
patient who died due to progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) following treatment with rituximab 
(Rituxan).
On 16/Apr/2007, she commenced rituximab for chronic lymphocytic leukemia. After magnetic resonance imaging 
(MRI) and biopsies of brain, she diagnosed with PML manifested by health began to deteriorate, lost her ability to 
focus, lost her memory, lost her ability to avoid objects while walking and suffered visual, speech and personality 
changes. On (b) (6)  she died due to PML.
The reporting lawyer assessed the fatal event of PML to be related to rituximab.
The following information was extracted from the medical record:  She was a past smoker and consumed alcohol. 
Her medical history included osteoporosis, depressive disorder, pernicious anemia and ataxia and concurrent 
conditions included hypertension and vitamin D deficiency. Her concomitant medications included dexamethasone, 
acetaminophen and cyanocobalamine. Her family history included  chronic lymphocytic leukemia (mother and 
grandmother). On 16/Apr/2007, she started therapy with rituximab (cycle 1) for treatment of chronic lymphocytic 
leukemia. On 23/Apr/2007 (cycle2), 30/Apr/2007 (cycle3) and 07/May/2007 (cycle 4),  she received rituximab 
therapies. On 14/May/2007 (cycle 5), rituximab dose was increased. On 21/May/2007 (cycle 6), 29/May/2007 (cycle
7), 04/Jun/2007 (cycle 8), 20/Sep/2007 (cycle 9), 16/Oct/2007 (cycle 10), 13/Nov/2007 (cycle 11) and 11/Dec/2007 
(cycle 12), she received rituximab therapies. On 12/Dec/2007, computed tomography (CT) of chest, pelvic and 
abdominal showed stable bilateral axillary, mediastinal, celiac, periportal, retroperitoneal, iliac and inguinal 
lymphadenopathy. On 08/Jan/2008, she received rituximab therapy (cycle 13) and bun/creatinine ratio was as high 
as 33 (normal value: 8-27). On 12/Feb/2008, she received rituximab therapy (cycle 14). On 13/Mar/2008, she 
received rituximab therapy (cycle 15) and underwent beta-2 microglobulin tumor marker test which revealed value 
as 4.7 mg/L (normal value: 0.7 to 3.4). On 10/Apr/2008 (cycle 16), 08/May/2008 (cycle 17) and 05/Jun/2008 (cycle 
18), she received rituximab therapies. On 15/May/2008, esophagogastroduodenoscopy showed mild patchy 
gastritis and polyp found in proximal transverse colon.  On 05/Jun/2008, she was doing well on rituximab (cycle 18).
On 03/Jul/2008 (cycle 19), 29/Jul/2008 (cycle 20), 28/Aug/2008 (cycle 21) and 25/Sep/2008 (cycle 22), she 
received rituximab therapies. On 15/Oct/2008, she complained of edema, GERD and gait abnormality. On 
24/Oct/2008, she was hospitalized for pneumonia manifested by fever shortness of breath, fever and cough and 
received intravenous levofloxacin and nifedipin. In Nov/2008, she had worsening of visual problems manifested by 
cortical blindness and hallucinations. On 14/Nov/2008, she underwent beta-2 microglobulin tumor marker test 
which revealed value as 5.40 mg/L. On 17/Nov/2008, she received rituximab therapy (cycle 23). On 09/Dec/2008, 
she underwent beta-2 microglobulin tumor marker test which revealed value as 5.20 mg/L. On 16/Dec/2008, she 
received rituximab therapy (cycle 24). On 29/Dec/2008, she complained of trouble focusing on the words. On the 
same day, MRI brain revealed areas of abnormal signal intensity involving occipital bones without significant mass

effect and White matter ischemic demyelination. In Jan/2009, radiological interpretation of an MRI of the brain 
revealed that there was possibility of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML). On 15/Jan/2009, she 
received rituximab therapy (cycle 25). On the same day, therapy with rituximab was interrupted because of 
worsening of cortical blindness and hallucinations and reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome 
(RPLES). It was reported that she received at least 26 doses of rituximab. On 20/Jan/2009, she was seen with 
worsening of visual disturbances. On 13/Feb/2009,MRI findings revealed there was possibility for progressive 
multifocal leukoencephalopathy and white matter demyelination change. On 17/Feb/2009, immunoglobin g 
(IgG)was positive for CMV as 9.2 (positive>1.0). On 11/Mar/2009, she developed persistant cortical blindness and
posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome. In response to treatment attempts failed, rituximab was discontinued. On
18/Mar/2009, immunoglobin g (IgG) was low as 565 (normal range: 700-1600). On 09/Jun/2009, MRI head 
revealed probable PRES, cerebellar cavernous hemangioma with venous angioma, cerebellar hemorrhage or 
infarction, possible hypertensive lacunar infarctions and upper neck mass.  On the same day, she was assessed to 
have cortical blindness and bioccipital white matter disease. On 12/Jun/2009, she underwent lumbar puncture and 
cerebrospinal fluid culture was found positive by polymerase chain reaction for John Cunningham (JC) virus with 
the COL-5 strain antibody. In-situ hybridization for JC virus was positive which confirmed diagnosis of progressive 
multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML). Later, she was initially started treatment with intravenous cidofivir. After two 
courses, her neurologic signs continued to progress through treatment and she was switched to intravenous 
cytosine arabinoside. She received two cycles of intravenous cytosine arabinoside, but this was complicated by 
neutropenic sepsis from the systemic therapy. She was then switched to intrathecal liposomal cytarabine per one 
cycle. On 24/Jun/2009, MRI head revealed progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML). She received 
treatment with fluoxetine, gabapentin and aspirin. On 29/Jun/2009 through 03/Jul/2009, she was treated with 
cytosine arabinoside(Cytarabine). On 03/Aug/2009, she started treatment with mefloquine hydrochloride.  On 
28/Sep/2009, MRI brain revealed findings were consistent with stable PML. On 27/Oct/2009, immunoglobin g (IgG) 
was low as 499. On (b) (6)  she was hospitalized for cerebrovascular accident (CVA) with a seizure. She was
treated with propofol. On (b) (6)  radiological findings showed stable bilateral parietal, occipital white matter 
hypodensities which were consistent with reversible encephalopathy syndrome and also stable left cerebral and 
brain stem cavernous hemangioma. It was also reported that there was stable occipital craniectomy and cerebellar 
encephalopathy. On (b) (6)  radiological findings showed new small atelectasis or infiltrate at right lung base 
and haziness in the right lung base represent focal congestion infiltrate. On (b) (6)  radiological findings 
showed worsening infiltrates. On (b) (6) , radiological findings were persistence although slight decreased 
diffuse bilateral lung infiltrate. From 19/May/2009 through 02/Dec/2009, her White blood cell count (WBC) was 
high. In (b) (6)  she was placed under hospice care. On (b) (6)  she expired following declining state of 
health due to complications of PML. On (b) (6)  autopsy was performed and histopathological examination of 
the brain at autopsy confirmed multiple foci of demyelination with pleomorphic astrocytes and reactive 
oligodendrocytes which were consistent with clinical history of PML, mild cerebral atrophy and the presence of JC 
virus by in situ hybridization.
