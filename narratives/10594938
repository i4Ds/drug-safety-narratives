Medically Significant
A neurologist spontaneously reported via a Biogen Idec Medical Science Liaison (MSL) that a female patient on 
TYSABRI (300 mg, IV, QM) for Multiple Sclerosis from 26 Sep 2011 to unknown date experienced PML 
characterized by dysphasia and mental status change (onset 2014). Internal databases indicated that the patient 
was enrolled in (b) (6)  and her first MS symptoms began on 26 Jun 2007. Prior to TYSABRI, 
previous therapies included Avonex (interferon beta-1a) from 01 Jul 2007 to unknown date and Copaxone 
(glatiramer acetate) from Apr 2011 to Aug 2011. At the time of this report, the TOUCH database indicated that the 
patient had received a total of 38 infusions of TYSABRI from 26 Sep 2011 to 30 Sep 2014. Approximately two 
weeks after the patient's 10 Sep infusion (date discrepant from TOUCH form which indicates a dose on 03 Sep 
2014 and one on 30 Sep 2014), the patient started noticing dysphasia (onset 2014) and a change in her mental 
status (onset 2014). At the three week mark, the patient went to see the neurologist who then performed an MRI 
(specific date unknown; results not provided) and ran a JCV index test, which came back at 3.4 (specific date 
unknown). The patient had a previous JCV index of 1.3 (date unknown). It was unclear whether the patient's last 
MRI was in Jan 2014 or Jul 2014. Treatment for the events included maraviroc, steroids (NOS), and Remeron 
(mirtazapine). The neurologist decided not to treat the patient with PLEX, and it was noted that "all JCV info was 
obtained from the patient's CSF." The outcome for the events PML, dysphasia, and mental status change is 
unknown. Causality for the events is unknown.  It is unknown if TYSABRI treatment is ongoing.
Update 07 Nov 2014: The neurologist spontaneously reported via a Biogen Idec MSL that the female patient 
received her last TYSABRI infusion on 30 Sep 2014 (which is consistent with TOUCH database). The index 
(presume JCV) was 1.3 in Jan (presume 2014); however the neurologist thinks that there may have been an 
additional index done in Jul (presume 2014) that was also 1.3, but this has not been confirmed. The patient's last 
MRI was in Jul (presume 2014) and was completely clear, no sign of PML. The CSF sample collected last week 
(specific date not provided) showed 3400 copies of JCV DNA.
Update 12 Nov 2014: The mother of the female patient on TYSABRI reported via a Biogen Idec sponsored 
marketing program of Monitored Therapy that the patient experienced trouble speaking (onset unknown; presume 
reference to previously reported dysphasia) and PML virus (onset unknown). It was noted that the patient has had 
MS for about 7 years. The mother reported that the patient is having trouble speaking due to the PML virus which 
was caused by TYSABRI. The reporter stated that the patient understands things, but is unable to say what she 
wants to. This has occurred off and on starting 2 weeks ago. The reporter noted that the patient went in right away 
and had an MRI (date unknown), which showed changes (NOS). Then a spinal tap was done (date unknown), 
which showed the PML virus. Treatment included Selzentry (maraviroc) to combat this, and the reporter stated that 
"they" are doubling the dose. Another MRI is scheduled for the day before Thanksgiving (presume 26 Nov 2014). 
The events are both ongoing. Causality for both events was assessed by the mother as possibly related to 
TYSABRI. TYSABRI therapy was discontinued.

Update 13 Nov 2014: Upon follow-up, the neurologist provided a completed PML Data Collection Form and 
corresponding medical records. The 42 year old female patient was on TYSABRI (300mg, IV, Q 28days) from 26 
Sep 2011 to 30 Sep 2014 and did not experience an interruption of product for more than 3 months. The patient's 
MS symptoms prior to the event were sensory-multifocal and consisted of paresthesias. Additional past medical 
history included depression, hyperlipidemia, psoriasis, some marijuana use, and tobacco (1-2 packs per week). 
The patient had not received any prior immunosuppressant therapy. Prior immunomodulatory therapy consisted of 
Avonex (interferon beta-1a) until May 2011 and Copaxone (glatiramer acetate) from May 2011 (discrepant 
information) to Aug 2011. The patient was enrolled in a Biogen Idec clinical trial ((b) (6)
(b) (6) ). A brain MRI on 21 Jan 2014 (compared to prior study on 25 Sep 2013) revealed the following: multiple T2 
hyperintense signal abnormalities involve supratentorial white matter. Findings are consistent with demyelinating 
plaques. Appearance has not changed significantly in the interval since prior study. A brain MRI with and without 
contrast on 09 Jul 2014 (compared to prior studies dating back to 21 Jan 2014) revealed: nonenhancing 
demyelinating plaques unchanged in size and appearance from prior studies. No new plaques are seen. Prior 
serum anti-JCV antibody testing was as follows: 08 Aug 2011 detected (index not available) (STRATIFY-2); 25 Jul 
2012 detected (index not available) (STRATIFY-2); 24 Jun 2013 positive (index not available); 20 Jan 2014 positive 
(index 1.40); 28 Jul 2014 positive (index 1.31).
On 27 Oct 2014, the patient contacted the neurologist very concerned and upset and was seen in his office that 
same day. The patient noted difficulty with verbal expression/significant expressive dysphasia for the last 1-2 weeks
(presume onset Oct 2014). The patient denies any comprehensive standpoint or other focal changes. In addition, 
the patient seems more upset and anxious than usual. A review of symptoms noted that the patient admits anxiety 
(onset unknown) and depression. A neurological exam indicated that attention and concentration were normal, 
fluency was moderately impaired, with no evidence of aphasia. Psychiatric examination indicated rate of thoughts 
was normal, mood and affect blunted. The neurologist noted that the patient was a long term TYSABRI patient (38 
doses) with excellent tolerability in the past. Her JCV antibodies had been positive, although trending down on her 
last lab. The patient was evaluated for PML because she presented with clinical signs and symptoms: 
cognitive/behavioral - confusion, repetitive questions (onset 27 Oct 2014; discrepant information); speech - 
expressive and receptive dysphasia (onset 27 Oct 2014; discrepant information), which prompted an MRI that 
revealed suspicious findings. The neurologist ordered an emergent brain MRI for 27 Oct 2014, which revealed 
(when compared to prior study on 09 Jul 2014): new since the prior study is a large white matter signal abnormality,
which involves much of the left temporal lobe. Also new since the prior study is a peripheral high left frontal lesion, a
left posterior perisylvian lesion, and a lesion adjacent to trigone of right lateral ventricle. While some of these 
lesions may relate to new demyelinating plaques, primary consideration is given to PML in this patient with a 
significant change in the interval since the prior study. Serum anti-JCV antibody testing on 27 Oct 2014 returned 
positive (index 3.32). A lumbar puncture on 27 Oct 2014 returned CSF JCV DNA ((b) (6) ) positive at 3428 
copies/ml. Additional CSF analysis revealed the following abnormal result: RBC of 6/uL (normal = absent). On 28

Oct 2014, lymphocyte count was 32% and absolute lymphocyte count was 3.3 (normal range 0.7-3.1). Treatment 
included Xanax (alprazolam) as needed for anxiety. 
On 31 Oct 2014, the patient presented to the neurologist's office for a follow-up visit. CSF JCV DNA ((b) (6) ) was 
still pending at this time. Culture was negative x 3 days. After further discussion, it was decided not to treat the 
patient with PLEX. Remeron (mirtazapine) 15 mg daily was initiated on 28 Oct 2014 along with maraviroc 150 mg 
twice daily. Earlier that week the patient had also received Solumedrol (methylprednisolone) 250 mg. It was noted 
that the family was aware of the concern for IRIS. The patient remains off work. She continues to have trouble 
expressing herself, understanding, and writing. Per notes from the patient's husband, the patient's personality 
changed 3 weeks ago after her last TYSABRI infusion. They did not alert the neurologist's office at that time 
because they thought it was "emotional." A review of systems noted that the patient admitted to anxiety and 
depression. Neurologic examination showed that the patient's attention was normal, concentration was mildly 
impaired, and no evidence of neglect. A marked expressive > receptive dysphasia was noted. Psychiatric 
examination revealed rate of thoughts was normal and mood and affect were blunted. The plan was to continue the
combination of maraviroc and Remeron, with serial MRI's and CSF analysis, and additional steroids (NOS) pending
IRIS.
On 07 Nov 2014, the patient returned to the neurologist's office for another follow-up visit. The CSF JCV DNA 
((b) (6) ) had returned positive at over 3000 copies. Culture negative x 3 days. The neurologist decided against 
PLEX given worsening IRIS (onset 2014). The patient also did not receive immunoadsorption. Remeron daily and 
maraviroc 150 mg twice daily had been tolerated well, so the plan was to increase dose of maraviroc pending 
repeat liver function tests (LFTs). It was noted again that the patient had Solumedrol 250 mg earlier last week. The 
patient remains off of work and continues to have trouble expressing herself, understanding, and writing. The 
husband noted subtle changes with speech roughly 3-5 days after the patient received her last TYSABRI infusion 
(presume onset Oct 2014). The husband had encouraged the patient to contact the neurologist at that time, but the 
patient refused.  A review of systems again noted that the patient admitted to anxiety and depression. Neurologic 
examination indicated that the patient's attention was normal, concentration mildly impaired, with no evidence of 
neglect. Marked expressive > receptive dysphasia was noted. Psychiatric examination noted that rate of thought 
processes was reduced and mood and affect were blunted. It was noted that the CSF results confirmed PML. 
Speech and comprehension remain problematic. The patient's LFTs will be repeated today (07 Nov 2014). If LFTs 
are normal, maraviroc will be increased to 300 mg twice daily. The patient will remain on Remeron. A repeat MRI 
with gad is planned in two weeks. The neurologist also anticipated repeating CSF analysis in the future. A brain 
biopsy has not been performed. At the time of this report, the patient was at home and the event of PML (and 
presumably the associated symptoms of dysphagia and mental status change) was ongoing. The outcome for the 
events of IRIS and anxiety is unknown. Causality for the event of PML (and presumably its symptoms of dysphasia 
and mental status change) was assessed by the neurologist as related to TYSABRI. Causality for the events of

anxiety and IRIS was not assessed by the neurologist. TYSABRI therapy was discontinued. 
Update 20 Nov 2014: On 20 Nov 2014 Biogen Idec considers this case to be a confirmed case of PML based on 
positive CSF, radiological evidence, and clinical symptoms.
Update 26 Nov 2014: The neurologist re-reported via a TOUCH Discontinuation Questionnaire that the female 
patient experienced PML. It was also noted that the patient had tested positive for the presence of anti-JCV 
antibodies sometime since 28 Sep 2014 (presume reference to anti-JCV antibody positive on 27 Oct 2014). No 
further information was provided.
Update 25 Feb 2015: The wife of a consumer reported via a program of Monitored therapy that she had been told 
that several patients at her husband's neurologist's office had contracted PML and died. The consumer did not 
know any additional details, except that she thought one patient was a female.
Update 04 Mar 2015: Upon written follow-up with the neurologist, the neurologist stated that his practice had only 
one PML patient, a female, and confirmed the patient's identity as the patient described in this case. He further 
clarified that the patient had died in (b) (6)  due to PML. An autopsy was not performed. No further information 
was provided.
Update 27 May 2015: The prescribing physician reported, via a TOUCH Prescribing Program Discontinuation 
Questionnaire, that the patient experienced PML, was no longer alive, and since 28 Sep 2014 had tested positive 
for the presence of anti-JCV antibodies.
