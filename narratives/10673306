Medically Significant
A neurologist spontaneously reported that a 50 year old female patient on TYSABRI (300 mg, IV, QM) for Multiple 
Sclerosis from 02 Jul 2013 to 29 Apr 2014 came under suspicion for progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy 
(PML) (onset unknown).  An MRI 3 months after TYSABRl discontinuation (date unknown) did not show an MS 
relapse or PML.  On an unknown date a lumbar puncture (LP) was done and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was sent for
JCV DNA testing (lab unknown).  No treatment was reported.  The outcome for the event PML suspicion is 
unknown. The causality for the event of PML suspicion is unknown.  TYSABRI therapy was previously discontinued.

Dec 2014.  At the time of that visit the patient was on a tapering dose of corticosteroids (NOS) for "post-TYSABRl 
withdrawal syndrome" which prompted suspicion for PML and immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome 
(IRIS).  The event was characterized by visual disorders (NOS), balance disorders, and static disorders (NOS).
The neurologist stated the patient recovered from the episode in May 2014, but, at the time of this report, still had a 
small visual deficit in the right eye.  CSF testing (date unknown) showed "a relatively low number of copies [of JCV 
DNA]".  An MRI from 29 Apr 2014 showed a fairly large lesion load as well as disorders in T1 and the left cerebellar 
peduncle.  A visual evoked potential (VEP) is planned for 20 Mar 2015 and the patient's next follow-up is scheduled
for 18 Jun 2015.

Update 05 Feb 2015:  The neurologist provided the following additional information.  The patient was alive and 
residing at home.  The patient was on TYSABRl from 21 Sep 2010 to 29 Apr 2014 (dates discrepant) with no 
interruption greater than 3 months.  TYSABRl therapy was discontinued due to PML risk and patient fear.  Prior MS 
therapies included AVONEX.  No previous immunosupressives were reported.  The patient tested positive for 
serum anti-JCV antibodies on an unknown date.  The patient first developed signs of MS in Jun 1987 and MS was 
diagnosed in 1994.  Prior to PML suspicion, the patient presented with motor and focal symptoms in 2005 
characterized by moderate left lower limb paresis of 4/5 and spasticity of the 2 lower limbs, visual symptoms 
occurred in 2005 characterized by internuclear opthalmoplegia, cerebellar symptoms occurred in 2005 
characterized by moderate ataxia and moderate upper limb dysmetria, multifocal sensory symptoms occurred in 
2009 characterized by paresthesia of feet/ hands and lower limb reduced pallesthesia, other symptoms occurred in 
2009 characterized by urinary urgencies.  An MRI prior to PML suspicion was done on 21 May 2014 (results not 
reported).  An MRI at the time of PML suspicion was done on 22 Aug 2014 (results not reported).  An LP was done 
on 21 Aug 2014 and the CSF tested positive for JCV DNA at 60 copies/ mL per (b) (6) .  Additional 
CSF analysis showed 12 leukocytes (lymphoplasmocytes) and oligoclonal bands.  No brain biopsy was performed.
Other testing on 21 Aug 2014 included absolute leukocytes of 8.9 g/L (reference range 4.3 to 10), absolute 
lymphocyte count of 2.14 g/L (reference range 1.5 to 4), CD4 of 0.95 g/L and CD8 of 0.35 g/L (reference ranges not
provided).  Treatment for the event of suspected PML included Solu-MEDROL (methylprednisolone) IV from 26 to 
28 Aug and oral Solupred (prednisolone 21-metasulphobenzoate sodium) since 29 Aug (progressive decreasing 
dose, starting at 50mg a day and, at the time of this report, on 30mg a day).  No plasma exchange was done.  At 
the time of this report, the patient has not received an MS disease therapy.

Update 13 Feb 2015:  The following additional information was provided.  The MRI from 21 May 2014 showed new 
subtentorial lesions in the left cerebellar hemisphere with slight Gd-enhancement.  The MRI from 18 Aug 2014 
showed new lesions in the left side of the cerebellum and in the left area of the cerebellar stalk that grew together to
form blotch that appeared in hyposignal in T1-sequence and in hypersignal in T2-sequence with heterogenous Gd-

enhancement.  It was stated that two hypothesis were raised by the neurologist to characterize those lesions: 
lesions are active MS atypical and inflammatory lesions or lesions have unusual PML lesion features. Unusual 
aspect of those lesions could be have been caused by previous medication. French Imputability:  C2 S2 I2
Update 19 Feb 2015:  Biogen Idec considers this case to be confirmed for PML based on positive CSF, clinical 
presentation, and presence of radiographic evidence.  The events of visual disorder, balance disorder, and static 
disorder are now subsumed under the diagnosis of confirmed PML.
Update 10 Jul 2015: Additional information was received from the neurologist via a MS Data Collection Tool. The 
patient is currently in the hospital. The suspect product per the neurologist is TYSABRI. The patient has tested 
negative for HIV (date not provided).  The neurologist assessed the patient s estimated Karnofsky score on 10 Jul 
2015, at the time of PML diagnosis, to be 30 (severely disabled; hospital admission is indicated although death not 
imminent). As of this report the patient has not been diagnosed with IRIS. The event of PML is not recovered and 
the causality of the event of PML has been assessed as related to TYSABRI.
Update 07 Aug 2015:  Additional information was received from the neurologist via a MS Data Collection Tool.  The 
neurologist assessed the patient's estimated EDSS score (at time of PML diagnosis) on 10 Jul 2015 to be 9.0.
Addendum: EDSS score (at time of PML diagnosis) on 10 Jul 2014 to be 9.0.
Update 28 Aug 2015: Additional information was received from the neurologist via a MS Data Collection Tool. The 
patient is currently alive and living at home. The patient is not currently on any therapy for MS.  Six months from 
time of diagnosis, in 2014, the patient's assessed Karnofsky score was 70 (cares for self; unable to carry on normal
activity or to do active work) and in Jan 2015 assessed EDSS score was 4.0.  In Aug 2015, 12 months from 
diagnosis, the patient's assessed Karnofsky and EDSS score were 70 (cares for self; unable to carry on normal 
activity or to do active work) and 4.0.  The most recent brain MRI was performed on 06 Aug 2015 with following 
result: MRI stable; no enhancement after Gadolinium.  Test results post-PML on 07 Aug 2015 include: leukocyte 
count of 6 G/L (normal), lymphocyte count of 1.86 G/L, and absolute lymphocyte count of 30.7 %. The patient has 
been diagnosed with IRIS with symptoms of optic neuropathy right - visual and ataxia - cerebellar (onsets Aug 
2015). The patient did not receive corticosteroids pre-IRIS. Post-IRIS the patient received corticosteroids including 
oral steroids daily from Aug 2014 to 05 Aug 2015.  At the time of this report, on 27 Aug 2015, the patient was 
assessed as recovered from PML and IRIS. Causality of events of PML and IRIS were assessed as related to 
TYSABRI.
