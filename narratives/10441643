Case number PHHY2014US091470, is a spontaneous report initially received from a physician on 17 Jul 2014 and 
forwarded by Medtronic Inc. (ADR 2014 01296) on 24 Jul 2014. This report refers to an 11 year old female patient. 
The patient had allergies to latex, cow's milk and was lactose intolerant. Additional medical history included 
pseudomeningocele, grade III IVH (intraventricular hemorrhage) and hydrocephalus, seizures, necrotizing 
enterocolitis, craniosynostosis, PDA (patent ductus arteriosus), asthma, left humeral fracture, scoliosis, small bowel
obstruction, pseudomeningocele, UTI (urinary tract infection) and no known drug allergies. Current condition 
included cerebral palsy, and asthma. The patient received Lioresal intrathecal (baclofen injection) 2000 mcg/ml for 
intractable spasticity from an unknown date at a dose of 130 mcg/day (lot number not reported) via an implantable 
infusion pump. The patient also received melatonin (unknown manufacturer) via gt (gastric tube) at a dose of 3ml at
bed time; Lamictal (lamotrigine) 100 mg oral; dissolve 1.5 tabs in water twice daily and administer via GT; Albuterol 
(salbutamol) 90 mcg inhaler at a dose of 2 puffs inhaled every 4 hours as needed and Albuterol 2.5 mg/3mLs at a

dose of 3 mLs as a neb twice daily and every 4 hours as needed; Zonegran (zonisamide) 50 mg capsule at a dose 
of 3 caps twice daily; Miralax (macrogol) 17 grams at a dose of 1 capful on even days and 0.5 capful on odd days; 
Nasonex (mometasone furoate) 50 mcg nasal spray at a dose of 1 spray daily; loratadine (unknown manufacturer) 
5 mg/5ml oral syrup at a dose of 10 ml orally daily; Singulair (montelukast sodium) 5 mg oral tablet at a dose of 1 
tab orally daily in evening; Pulmicort (budesonide) 1mg/2 ml inhaler at a dose of 1 vial inhaled twice daily; Zantac 
(ranitidine hydrochloride) 15 mg/ml syrup at a dose of 5 ml twice daily; and Acetaminophen (paracetamol) 160 mg/5
ml at a dose of 10 ml orally every 4 hours as needed. The patient also received baclofen (manufacturer unknown), 
diazepam (manufacturer unknown), Mylanta (calcium carbonate) and ampicillin (manufacturer unknown), all drugs 
at an unknown dose for an unknown indication from an unknown date (also reported as at the time of the events). 
On an unknown date, the patient experienced swelling to back pseudomeningocele which was persistent. The 
pump was refilled on (b) (6)  there was no drug in the pump reservoir. The patient denied withdrawal 
syndrome. On (b) (6)  the patient presented to the emergency room (ER) with ileus. The patient was worked 
up for ileus. The physician was planning to do a dye study and rotor study as well as a computed tomography (CT) 
scan of the catheter to attempt to identify the problem. It was noted that the patient required hospitalization. As per 
the pump telemetry examined on (b) (6)  It was uncertain if ileus was related to the device at all. The catheter 
dye study was aborted due to an inability to aspirate the catheter. The patient underwent a MRI (magnetic 
resonance imaging) dye study. The cause of the empty pump reservoir was leak of the pump connector. The alarm 
was not confirmed through telemetry. Per this report, the pump delivered Lioresal at a dose of 49.98mcg/day. The 
patient system was replaced on (b) (6)  The distal catheter from the intrathecal entry point was not removed; 
instead, the catheter was tied off, sutured down, and buried under fascia. The distal portion of the catheter was not 
going to be returned for evaluation. With the new placement, very productive back flow of CSF (cerebral spinal 
fluid) with needle placement was achieved. Analysis of pump revealed that there was no anomaly found. The 
catheter analysis revealed, that there were coring tears cuts in the seal of the sutureless catheter connector and the
catheter met the leak criteria. It was reported that, the need for an appointed catheter revision due to the 
development of a pseudomeningocele located at the spine. The physician had drained it multiple times, applied 
pressure dressings, and performed a blood patch. The patient was brought to surgery today on (b) (6)  to 
explore the spinal site. About 50 cc of yellow tinted clear fluid escaped from the incision and was cultured. Careful 
dissection was performed, and slow seepage was identified around the insertion point of the spine. After releasing 
the sutures at the anchor eyes, the physician carefully advanced the catheter and over sewed the fascia. The 
catheter was cut and aspiration from the catheter was attempted. After several attempts, aspiration was not 
possible and no spontaneous backflow of CSF was noted. Contrast medium was utilized for a catheter study, and 
images were sent to radiology for the reading radiologist to determine if the catheter was located in the epidural 
space. Upon attempt to reinsert the catheter, a significant amount of bloody fluid was noted at the time of LP 
(lumbar puncture). The physician decided to abort the catheter replacement attempt. The pump segment of the 
catheter was tied off and left in place. The pump was set to minimum rate. Oral baclofen management was 
discussed. It was planned for the patient to return in 4 6 weeks to replace the catheter. Upon follow up it was

reported that, the patients pump was administering Lioresal Intrathecal (2000 mcg/ml) at a dose rate of 96 
mcg/day. There were no other symptoms related to the event reported other than the pseudomeningocele. As of (b)(6)
 the patient was currently in the ICU, being treated with oral baclofen, and was being managed by the 
pediatric neurologist. The location of the issue was the distal catheter segment which was identified via intraop 
fluoroscopy. The catheter had backed out, plugging the hole. The HCP attempted to reposition the catheter without 
success and attempted to place a new catheter without success due to sac being collapsed from CSF leaking. The 
patient's family had elected not to have the baclofen pump replaced and wanted to continue on oral baclofen only. 
Later it was reported that the pump and catheter that were implanted on (b) (6)  were explanted on (b) (6)  
 Later, information was received from the physician's office indicating that surgery occurred on (b) (6)
(unspecified). It was also reported that the pump was explanted on (b) (6)  the ascenda catheter was 
explanted on (b) (6)  and the sutureless catheter connector had been explanted on (b) (6)  The patient
recovered without permanent impairment. Action taken with Lioresal intrathecal was dose decreased and for 
suspect drugs it was not reported. The seriousness of the events was reported serious (medically significant) by the
reporter. The outcome of the events was complete recovery (reported as recovered without permanent 
impairment). The causality of the event Ileus was reported as reported as not likely related to the pump therapy (not
suspected) with Lioresal and for other events it was not reported.
