This spontaneous literature report was received from Genzen JR, Hunsaker JJ, Nelson LS, Faine BA, Krasowski 
MD. N-acetylcysteine interference of Trinder-based assays. Clinical Biochemistry 2016; 49 (1):100-104 and 
concerns a 5-year-old male patient from the United States. 
The trade name of the suspect drug was not reported and it was assumed to be the company brand for reporting 
purposes.
The primary objective of this study was to evaluate potential interference of Trinder-based chemistry assays by N-
acetylcysteine (NAC). A secondary objective was to look for evidence of interference in patients treated with NAC 
for acetaminophen (APAP) overdose.

The patient's height, weight and medical history were not reported.
The patient was treated with paracetamol (unspecified formulation, route of administration, dose and frequency) 
initiated on an unspecified date for unspecified indication. Concomitant medications were not reported.
Method includes, previously collected lithium heparin plasma specimens were obtained from refrigerated storage (4
C) and de-identified in accordance with an Institutional Review Board (IRB) approved protocol. In order to 
effectively detect assay inhibition, specimens were selected to target the following concentrations in the final pool of
plasma used for all subsequent studies: enzymatic creatinine, 1-3 mg/dL; triglyceride, 100-300 mg/dL, glucose 
(GLUC) 90-180 mg/dL. NAC stock solutions were created (n=5; 10,000 mg/L) using pooled plasma. Serial dilutions 
from each stock solution were prepared with pooled plasma and then incubated for 2 h at room temperature prior to
testing. Most assays were performed on a Roche cobas c502 chemistry instrument using the following Roche 
reagents: cholesterol gen.2, creatinine plus ver.2 (enzymatic), glucose HK, HDL-cholesterol plus gen.3, 
triglycerides, urea/BUN, and uric acid ver.2. LDL testing was conducted using N-geneous LDL cholesterol reagent 
on a Roche cobas c702 instrument. The Roche LDL-C plus gen.2 and lactate reagents were not evaluated, as they 
were not used for clinical testing at ARUP. Results are presented as mean   standard deviation (SD) unless 
otherwise indicated.
This review covered patients seen from 01-MAY-2011 to 19-JUN-2015 (49 months; start date based on when the 
clinical laboratory switched to an enzymatic Roche method for Cr determination in plasma). Patient results (BUN, 
Cr, GLUC), as well as information on additional IV hydration, were included if both baseline and post-NAC initiation 
(within 8 h) testing was performed. During the time period of retrospective analysis, the same protocol for IV NAC 
treatment of APAP toxicity was used throughout the institution, namely 150 mg/kg loading dose over 1 hr followed 
by maintenance doses of 50 mg/kg over 4 h and 100 mg/kg over 16 h. This was a common regimen for 
management of APAP toxicity. Results from chart review were plotted in Sigma Plot 11 as Box Plots, with patient 
results normalized to a baseline (pre-NAC) initiation analyte measurement. Post-NAC time periods were binned into
0.0-3.9 h and 4.0-8.0 h intervals; no patients had laboratory test results within both intervals. Statistical analysis was
conducted using Student's or paired t-tests, as appropriate. Results included, baseline analyte results (in the 
absence of NAC) in our plasma pool were as follows (in mg/dL, n= 5): BUN, 36.3   0.5; CHOL, 140.8  3.3; 
enzymatic Cr, 2.6  0.1; GLUC, 122   1.9; HDL-C, 35  0.7; LDL-C, 71.6   0.5; TRIG, 180.2  2.9; UA, 6.2  0.1. 
NAC was capable of inhibiting 6 of the 8 assays evaluated. The NAC concentrations (shown in parentheses) that 
caused more than equal to 10% assay inhibition, in order of sensitivity to interference for individual assays, were: 
triglyceride (570 mg/L), cholesterol (740 mg/L) equal to creatinine (790 mg/L) N uric acid (1100 mg/L) HDL-
Cholesterol (1760 mg/L) LDL- Cholesterol (2900 mg/L). As expected, neither BUN nor GLUC achieved 10% 
inhibition at NAC concentrations up to 10,000 mg/L, the highest concentration evaluated based on our stock 
solution. Serial dilutions of NAC demonstrated an interesting difference in a subset of results for the triglyceride

assay. Two NAC concentrations (1317mg/L and 1975 mg/L) resulted in initial "NKin" instrument errors for the 
triglyceride assay on the cobas c502, along with preliminary flagged TRIG results. "NKin" was a potential prozone 
flag, which leads to repeat testing using an auto-dilution on the instrument. The UIHC EHR was reviewed for cases 
of IV NAC administration for suspected and/or documented APAP overdose in the emergency department. The 
only Trinder-based assay that was routinely ordered both pre- and post-NAC initiation (within 8 h) was Cr, usually 
as part of a basic or comprehensive metabolic panel. BUN and GLUC were also reviewed to serve as non-Trinder 
controls, as these might also reflect changes in hydration (and or GLUC) that would be expected to accompany 
administration of IV NAC mixed into 5% dextrose in water (D5W). Other potential Trinder-based assays (ex. TRIG, 
LDL-C, HDL-C) were not routinely ordered pre- and/or post-NAC initiation. In the time period of retrospective 
analysis, 262 patients received IV NAC for APAP overdose (acetaminophen overdose). One hundred and two of 
these individuals had laboratory studies (BUN, Cr, and/or GLUC) done both before and within 8 h after IV NAC 
initiation. Of those that did have labs performed within 8 h post-NAC initiation, the mean time for laboratory 
specimen collection was 4.6   2.0 h (median 4.6 h) following initial NAC bolus dose. Of these 102 patients, 98 had 
pre- and post-NAC Cr measurements performed. This dataset included 1 child (age 5 yr.; male), 5 adolescents 
(ages 12-16 yr.; 4 females, 1 male), and 92 adults (ages 18-91 yr.; 49 females, 43 males). The remaining 4 
individuals had either BUN and/or GLUC measurements (but not Cr) and were included in analyses for these 
analytes only. On average, when measured within 4 h after initiation of IV NAC, a 19.5 19.7% (range-77.8 to 7.5%) 
decrease in Cr fromthe initial baseline (pre-NAC) Cr concentration was observed across patients (n=33 p = 0.002); 
Cr concentrations were also significantly lower (-5.1   55.5%; range -80 to 400%) compared to pre-NAC 
concentrations when measured 4-8 h after NAC-initiation (n = 65, p = 0.021). While a trend toward Cr recovery over
time was suspected between groups (0-4 h, median 20.0%; 4-8 h, median-12.5. This was not statistically significant
(p= 0.189). None of the pediatric or adolescent patients had a pre- or post-NAC Cr result that was greater than their
age-specific reference intervals. Of the adult specimens, 34 (18 males, 16 females) had a pre-NAC Cr 
concentration greater than their gender-specific upper reference limit (N1.2mg/dL,males; N1.0mg/dL, females). The
average Cr concentration in these 34 individuals was lower in their post-NAC specimens (pre: 2.9   1.5 mg/dL; 
post: 2.6   1.7 mg/dl; p = 0.029), although only 7 of these 34 individuals (20.6%, or 7% of all patients) had a post-
NAC Cr measurement that crossed into the normal range after previously being abnormal before NAC was 
administered. As IV NAC was frequently administered with D5W, an analysis of BUN and GLUC concentrations at 
0-4 hand 4-8 h intervals was also conducted to determine whether Cr decreases might also be due to associated 
hydration status. No statistically significant differences were noted when comparing baseline (pre-NAC) BUN 
concentrations to those observed in the 0-4 h post-NAC interval (-6.7   17.2%; range, -50 to 20%; n=35; p=0.219. A
trend toward decreased BUN concentration was observed when comparing pre-NAC BUN to the 4-8 h post-NAC 
interval (-7.7  22.1%; range -62.5 to 57.1%; n = 64), although this was not statistically significant (p = 0.092). There
was also not a statistically significant difference in BUN concentrations between groups (0-4 h, median - 0.0%; 4-8 
h, median - 6.9%; p = 0.731). GLUC concentrations, however, were higher at both the 0-4 h post-NAC interval (54.6
 116.8%; range - 24.9 to 618.5%; n = 33; p = 0.010) and 4-8 h post-NAC intervals (36.3   64.6%; range-51.1 to

340.7%; n=60; p b 0.001). This finding might be consistent with either the administration of D5W or nutritional 
intake. Finally, additional IV hydration (outside of D5Wusedwith IV administration of NAC) may also be associated 
with the medical care of suspected APAP overdose. To investigate the potential contribution of additional IV 
hydration, chart review was conducted to identify which patients received additional normal saline (NS) or Lactated 
Ringers (LR) solution between pre- and post-NAC laboratory test results, as well as what volume of fluids was 
administered. Of the 102 patients reviewed, 41 (40.2%) did not have any evidence of additional IV hydration in the 
chart. The average additional IV fluid administration in the remaining 61 patients (59.8%) was 1.57   1.24 L (range: 
0.06-5.00 L). No statistically significant differences were observed when comparing these populations according to 
absolute or percent differences in Cr and BUN results pre- and post-NAC administration.
Action taken with paracetamol was not reported.
The outcome of event acetaminophen overdose was not reported. 
The reporter concluded that NAC inhibition of the assays investigated typically occurs at concentrations higher than 
expected during IV and oral NAC therapy.
This report was serious (medically significant).
