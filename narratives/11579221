This serious post marketing surveillance report from the United States received on 22-SEP-2015 by a nurse, and 
confirmed by the physician via the (b) (6)  describes the occurrence of Wound, Rash 
pruritic, Rash erythematous, Pyrexia, Stridor, Anaphylactic reaction, and Cellulitis in a 10 year-old Asian male 
patient administered idursulfase for Mucopolysaccharidosis II.
The past medical history for the patient included: Hypersensitivity, Bronchial hyperreactivity (see MFR# SPV1-2010-
01920). The concurrent medical history for the patient included: Sleep disorder, Aortic valve incompetence, Pain, 
Developmental delay, Agitation, Abnormal behaviour. The patient had no known allergies. The patient procedure 
history included: Central venous catheterisation, Catheterisation venous, Adenoidectomy, Laryngoscopy, 
Bronchoscopy.
Concomitant medications included: DIPHENHYDRAMINE, PREDNISOLONE, PARACETAMOL, RISPERIDONE, 
ENALAPRIL, IBUPROFEN, EPINEPHRINE.
The patient commenced treatment with idursulfase on 22-JAN-2010. The dose was 0.33 mg, 1x/week. On 27-
MAR-2015, the dose was 0.5 mg, 1x/week, with the most recent infusion on 14-SEP-2015.
The patient developed the following adverse events: In SEP-2015, described as last week, the patient slipped at the
school pool and sustained a superficial abrasion to his buttocks. The abrasion had not bothered him until 20-SEP-
2015, when his father noticed him scratching it. The abrasion was draining a pus substance and felt warm. The 
area became reddened and itchy on his lower back and buttocks overnight along with experiencing a fever. The 
patient went to the clinic on (b) (6)  for his scheduled infusion. Prior to administration, the patient developed a
diffuse rash/hives, lip swelling, facial swelling, difficulty breathing, and stridor. With concern for acute anaphylaxis 
the patient was administered Epinephrine and Benadryl (diphenhydramine hydrochloride). The events improved; 
however, the patient was transferred to the hospital for further evaluation, via ambulance. On evaluation in the 
emergency room the patient was found to have significant facial swelling, redness, urticarial rash, and 
erythematous area with tenderness in low left back and buttocks with some warmth. Respiratory symptoms had 
improved as the patient was saturating well on room air. The reporting physician reported that the hives, facial 
swelling and shortness of breath was consistent with anaphylaxis and the patient was treated accordingly. 
Treatment included Zyrtec (CETIRIZINE HYDROCHLORIDE), Decadron (DEXAMETHASONE), Hydroxyzine,

Ibuprofen, and a fluid bolus. The patient was very warm to touch and tender surrounding the abrasion. His fever, 
white blood cell (WBC) count of 17.2, c-reactive protein (CRP) of 5.12, significant excoriations and tissue 
breakdown, along with noted symptoms caused concern for cellulitis. A culture was collected of drainage and 
results were pending. Treatment of intravenous Ancef (CEFAZOLIN SODIUM) was initiated and the patient was 
admitted on (b) (6)  for further monitoring of allergic reaction. On admission the patient had tactile fevers, 
improved hives, breathing, and swelling. There were no further hives or urticarial rash noted and the large 
superficial abrasion had one 1 cm diameter ulceration noted that was draining a clear/yellowish discharge. The 
patient was discharged on (b) (6)
The outcome of the events was reported as follows: the events of Wound, Rash pruritic, Rash erythematous and 
Cellulitis were recovering/resolving; the event of Pyrexia, was recovered/resolved and stopped on (b) (6)
and the events of Stridor and Anaphylactic reaction were reported as recovered/resolved and stopped on (b) (6)
(b) (6)
The action taken with the primary suspect therapy idursulfase was dose not changed. 
This report was considered serious for the following events: Wound (Hospitalization, Medically Significant), Rash 
pruritic (Hospitalization), Rash erythematous (Hospitalization), Pyrexia (Hospitalization), Stridor (Hospitalization), 
Anaphylactic reaction (Hospitalization, Medically Significant), Cellulitis (Hospitalization, Medically Significant). 
Causality was assessed by the physician for the events of Anaphylactic reaction (intensity severe) and Stridor 
(intensity severe) as possibly related to idursulfase. Causality was assessed by the nurse for the events of Cellulitis,
Pyrexia, Rash erythematous, Rash pruritic and Wound as unknown if related to therapy with idursulfase.
The following laboratory and/or diagnostic tests were performed:

Follow up information was received by a physician on 19-DEC-2015. The report type changed from solicited to post 
marketing surveillance. An additional reporter was added. The patient information, hospital discharge date, reporter
causality, relevant history, suspect drug information, outcome for the event of Anaphylactic reaction and the 
narrative were updated to reflect the additional information provided.
Additional significant follow-up information was received on 22-MAR-2016. Suspect medication batch/lot number, 
stop date for events of Stridor and Anaphylactic reaction, and narrative were updated to reflect follow-up 
information provided. 
Company comment:  The company Pharmacovigilance Physician has assessed the events of Wound, Cellulitis, 
Rash erythematous, Rash pruritic, and Pyrexia as not related to idursulfase.  Rather, the patient slipped at his 
school the week prior to the events and sustained a superficial abrasion to his buttocks, which appears to become 
infected and led to the Cellulitis, Rash erythematous, Rash pruritic, and Pyrexia.  The company Pharmacovigilance 
Physician has assessed the event of Stridor and Anaphylactic reaction as unlikely related to idursulfase given that 
his last infusion occurred one week prior to the events.  These events may also be the result of an acute systemic 
infection, but the company Pharmacovigilance Physician concurred with treating physician that a contributory role of
idursulfase cannot be ruled out. This single case report does not alter the benefit/risk profile of the product.
