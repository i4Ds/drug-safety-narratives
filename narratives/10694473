Medically Significant
A company representative reported [presumed on behalf of a physician] that a female patient on TYSABRI (300 
mg, IV, QM) for Multiple Sclerosis from 14 Dec 2007 to 21 Nov 2014 reported being hospitalized from (b) (6)
to an unknown date for suspect PML (onset unknown). The patient has had two rounds of plasmapheresis to 
remove any TYSABRI from her body. The outcome for the event suspect PML is unknown. At the time of this 
report, the TOUCH database indicated the patient received a total of 90 infusions of TYSABRI from 14 Dec 2007 to 
21 Nov 2014. The causality for the event of suspect PML is unknown.  It is unknown if TYSABRI treatment is 
ongoing.
Update 23 Dec 2014: Follow-up information was received from the patient's physician who reported the 34 year old 
adult patient was hospitalized on (b) (6)  (previously reported as (b) (6) ) with a possible case of PML.
No further information was provided.
Update 24 Dec 2014: Follow-up information was received from the neurologist's office. The patient is JCV antibody 
positive (date and index not provided).  The patient was seen on (b) (6)  for an infusion which was held and 
the patient was admitted for suspect PML due to syptoms which had gradually worsened: speech, cognition, and 
gait.  The patient has completed two cycles of PLEX.  CSF JCV PCR is pending.  They anticipate starting steroids 
post-PLEX as they anticipate IRIS.  The patient is enrolled in the (b) (6)  and is JCV 
antibody positive.  MS onset was Jan 2001.  The patient had no prior immunosuppressant therapy.  Previous 
therapies included Rebif (interferon beta-1a) and Copaxone (glatiramer acetate).  The patient was noted to have 
done well on therapy and therefore continued despite JCV positive status.
Update 24 Dec 2014: Follow-up information received included clinic notes and MRI reports.  The patient was 
admitted on (b) (6)  with gradual worsening symptoms: speech (dysarthia, fluency and word finding), balance,
and cognitive function.  It has become more dramatic to the extent that she could no longer keep it from her 
employer. On 21 Nov 2014, her MS symptoms had improved since Oct, but MD noted that over previous 3-4 
months her MS symptoms seemed to be worsening especially gait so onset Sep or Oct 2014.  Brain MRI on 01 Oct
2014 showed no change in MS plaques in cerebral white matter bilaterally from 05 Nov 2013, no enhancement.
Cervical MRI on 01 Oct 2014 showed MS plaques in midline dorsal cord at C4 & in right lateral cord at C8. Since 
prior exam in Nov 2013 these plaques are unchanged to slightly smaller.  Tspine on same day showed no MS 
plaques.  Brain MRI on (b) (6)  showed  extensive periventricular deep white matter demyelination extending 
to subependymal surface consistent with MS. Findings are present bilaterally throughout deep white matter. Of note
is extensive demyelination throughout the left temporal lobe, hippocampus and subinsular cortex. Basal ganglia are
normal. There is demyelination in posterior limb of both internal capsules, the anterior right temporal lobe and 
posteriorly in both occipital lobes, corpus callosum is markedly atrophic.

FOIA Case Report Information
Update 29 Dec 2014: Follow-up information received from the neurologist indicated the CSF JCV DNA result was 
positive.
Update 02 Jan 2015: Information received via the STRATIFY2 database indicated the patient tested positive for 
anti-JCV antibodies on 29 Aug 2011 with nOD of 0.607.
Update 08 Jan 2015: Biogen Idec considers this case to be a confirmed case of PML based on positive CSF, 
radiologic evidence, and clinical presentation.
Update 23 Jan 2015: The patient's aunt spontaneously reported that the patient has confirmed PML and is now in 
the IRIS stage.  The patient has undergone plasma exchange.  No further information was provided.
Update 30 Jan 2015: The neurologist reported, via a TOUCH Prescribing Program Form, that the patient, enrolled 
in a Biogen Idec sponsored program of Monitored Therapy, experienced PML.
Update 20 Apr 2015: Additional information was received from the neurologist via a Standardized MS PML Data 
Collection Tool. The patient had a positive serum anti-JCV antibody result in 2008. On 01 Oct 2014 (on TYSABRI 
prior to PML), the neurologist assessed the patient's estimated Karnofsky and EDSS scores to be 90 (able to carry 
on normal activity; minor signs or symptoms of disease) and 2.5. On (b) (6)  (time of PML diagnosis), the 
patient's estimated Karnofsky and EDSS scores were 70 (cares for self; unable to carry on normal activity or to do 
active work) and 5.5. A lumbar puncture was performed on (b) (6)  (results not provided). The following test 
results from (b) (6)  (on suspect product prior to PML) were reported: leukocyte count 10.1 (normal range 4 - 
10), lymphocyte count 4.82 (normal range 1.48 - 4.50), HIV test negative. The following test results from (b) (6)  
(b) (6)  (pre-PLEX) were reported: leukocyte count 6.8, lymphocyte count 3.87. The patient was diagnosed with IRIS, 
which was determined by clinical symptoms (symptoms not reported). The patient received corticosteroids pre-IRIS
onset. Treatment for IRIS included Solumedrol (methylprednisolone) 1 GM IV every two weeks from (b) (6)
to(b) (6)  The patient died on(b) (6)  and was in hospice at that time. The cause of death was reported as
respiratory failure; an autopsy was not performed. The events of respiratory failure and PML were assessed as 
related to TYSABRI.
Update 28 Apr 2015: Follow-up information included MRI images for the following: brain, cervical, and thoracic 
spine performed on 01 Oct 2014, and brain MRIs performed on (b) (6) (b) (6)  and(b) (6)  MRI 
results were reported as follows: 01 Oct 2014 Brain MRI: no change in MS plaques in cerebral white matter 
bilaterally from 05 Nov 2013- no enhancement. 01 Oct 2014 Cervical MRI: MS plaques in midline dorsal cord at C4 
and in right lateral cord at C8. Since prior exam in Nov 2013 these plaques were unchanged to slightly smaller. 
Thoracic spine on same day showed no MS plaques. (b) (6)  MRI: no evidence of mass, mass effect, or shift

of midline structures. Extensive periventricular deep white matter demyelination extending to subependymal surface
consistent with MS. Findings were present bilaterally throughout deep white matter. Of note was extensive 
demyelination throughout the left temporal lobe, hippocampus and subinsular cortex. Basal ganglia were normal. 
There was demyelination in posterior limb of both internal capsules, the anterior right temporal lobe and posteriorly 
in both occipital lobes, corpus callosum was markedly atrophic. (b) (6)  MRI brain: grossly stable 
encephalopathy appearance with both multifocal white matter disease in keeping with a history of MS, and hazy 
confluent left greater than right cerebral involvement which may indicate opportunistic infection. No enhancing 
lesions. CSF analysis was performed on (b) (6)  with results reported as follows: clear/ colorless, RBCs 35 
(ref range 0-5/cu mm); WBCs 1 (ref range less than/equal to 5/cu mm); neutrophils 10% (ref range 0-5%); 
lymphocytes 60%  (ref range 40-80%), monophils 30%  (ref range 15-45%), eosinophils 0 (ref range less 
than/equal to 0%), basophils 0 (reference range less than/equal to 0%), CSF glucose 60 (ref range 40-70 mg/dL); 
CSF protein 20  (ref range 15-45 mg/dL); HSV PCR negative. On (b) (6) , CSF JCV DNA was detected 
(NOS).
Update 14 Oct 2015: The patient's mother spontaneously reported that the patient experienced PML (onset (b) (6)  
(b) (6) ) and coma (onset(b) (6) ). The reporter stated the patient went into a coma and died on (b) (6)
The patient's mother considered the cause of death to be PML. She added that TYSABRI worked and she was on it
for seven years but PML came on "out of the blue" and only took(b) (6)  months for her daughter to pass away. No 
testing or treatment information was provided. The outcome of the event of coma prior to the death of the patient  is
unknown. Causality was not assessed.
