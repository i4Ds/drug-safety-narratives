AER 1492409 is an interventional study case received on 14/Nov/2014, from a hematologist and concerns an 86 
year old female patient (patient number: (b) (6) ) who experienced possible progressive multifocal 
leukoencephalopathy while enrolled in (b) (6)
(b) (6)
The patient's medical history included humerus fracture. Her concurrent conditions included diabetes mellitus, 
hypertension, parkinson's disease, cataract., nausea, headache, constipation, itchy skin, sinusitis, fatigue, 
depression and epigastric pain. Her concomitant medications included metformin, insulin, enalapril, 
benserazide/levodopa, amantadine hydrochloride, aspirin, dimenhydrinate, acetylcysteine, cassia 
pulp/coriander/licorice/senna/tamarind, dimenhydrinate, dipyrone, ondansetron, bisacodyl, betamethasone, 
azithromycin, dexamethasone/moxifloxacin hydrochloride, tenoxicam, hydrocortisone, paracetamol, gatifloxacin, 
ketorolac trometamol, atropine, fluoxetine, cyanocobalamin/pyridoxine hydrochloride/thiamine mononitrate, 
diphenhydramine, prednisolone acetate, caffeine/dipyrone/orphenadrine citrate, paroxetine hydrochloride, 
cyclophosphamide, vincristine, prednisone, acebrofilina, penicillin benzathine, drusolol, prednisolone, pharmaton 
and esomeprazole magnesium.  No past drugs were reported. She was never immuno deficient and did not 
undergo bone marrow or solid bone transplantation or brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). No chronic viral 
infections, herpes simplex or herpes zoster infection, opportunistic infections or cytomegalovirus (CMV) 
pneumocystic pathology [central nervous system (CNS) lupus or CNS lymphoma] were reported.
On 09/Dec/2008, the patient was diagnosed with follicular lymphoma (grade 1). On 02/Mar/2009, she started 
induction therapy with intravenous rituximab 600 mg every 21 days. Subsequently, she received 8 cycles of the 
therapy until the onset of event and stopped on 11/Aug/2009. On 15/Apr/2013, she gave informed consent for 
enrollment in clinical trial. On 30/Apr/2013, she started intravenous rituximab 638 mg (form and frequency not 
reported). On 29/May/2013, 26/Jun/2013, 24/Jul/2013, 21/Aug/2013, 18/Sep/2013, 30/Oct/2013, 27/Nov/2013, 
05/Feb/2014 and 02/Apr/2014, she received subcutaneous rituximab at a dose of 1400mg (batch lot number: 
B0008). On 23/Apr/2014, she underwent resection of left supra labial injury. On 15/May/2014, she underwent 
resection of lesion at the right nasal tip. On 28/May/2014, 23/Jul/2014 and 17/Sep/2014, she received her next 
doses of subcutaneous rituximab 1400 mg (batch number: B0008) for 56 days. On 02/Nov/2014, she experienced 
moderate possible progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (severity: grade 2). The signs and symptoms of the 
event included tetreparesia, dyslalia, dysphagia, mental confusion and paraparesis of upper limbs. On 
(b) (6)  she was hospitalised due to the event. On the same day, nuclear magnetic resonance imaging brain 
was done and it showed signal change affecting the middle cerebellar peduncle and the cerebellar parenchyma 
right without restriction on broadcasting and with small foci of enhancement inside, which were considered as more 
likely the changes of possible progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy or subacute ischemic changes. On 
24/Nov/2014, therapy with rituximab was permanently discontinued.

FOIA Case Report Information
At the time of this report, possible progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy was persisting. 
The hematologist assessed possible progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy as related to intravenous and 
subcutaneous rituximab.
No further information was provided.
Follow up was received on 24/Nov/2014. Following information was added to the case: patient details updated 
(height and weight), concomitant medications added, study drug reported as rituximab with therapy details,  event 
term ammended as progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy from lower limb paresthesia, lab test added.
Follow up was received on 27/Nov/2014. Following information was added to the case: On 24/Nov/2014, therapy 
with rituximab was permanently discontinued, batch number of subcutaneous rituximab (B0008) and event 
description updated "On 23/Apr/2014, she underwent resection of left supra labial injury. On 15/May/2014, she 
underwent resection of lesion at the right nasal tip".
Additional information was received on 12/Dec/2014. Following information has been added to the case: 
investigator reported that resection of left supra labial injury and resection of lesions in the right nasal tip was not 
considered as serious adverse event but adverse event.
Additional information was received on 01/Apr/2015 and the following information was added to the case: negative 
medical history (chronic viral infections, herpes simplex or herpes zoster infection, opportunistic infections, CMV 
pneumocystic pathology, immunodeficiency, bone marrow or solid bone transplantation and brain MRI), date of 
diagnosis of follicular lymphoma (09/Dec/2008), new dosage regimen for IV rituximab (600 mg every 21 days, 
therapy start date: 02/Mar/2009 and end date: 11/Aug/2009), new concomitants (cyclophosphamide, vincristine and
prednisone), signs and symptoms of the event (tetraparesis, dyslalia, dysphagia, mental confusion and para paresis
of upper limbs) and event description.
Additional information was received on 12/May/2016. The following information was added to the case: Event 
progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy was amended to possible progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy 
and event description updated accordingly.
