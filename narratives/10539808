A neurologist spontaneously reported via a Biogen Idec Representative that a 42 year old female patient on 
TYSABRI (300mg, IV, QM) for unknown indication from 09 Sep 2009 to 19 Jun 2014 experienced suspect PML 
(onset unknown). Information from internal databases indicated that the patient was diagnosed with MS in 1997. 
Prior MS therapies included Copaxone (glatiramer acetate) (dates of therapy unknown), Rebif (interferon beta 1a) 
(dates of therapy unknown), Betaseron (interferon beta 1b) from Dec 2008 to 21 Mar 2009, and Solumedrol 
(methylprednisolone) (dates of therapy unknown). The patient was enrolled in (b) (6)  At the time of
this report, the TOUCH database indicated that the patient had received a total of 50 infusions of TYSABRI from 09
Sep 2009 to 19 Jun 2014. The neurologist reported that the patient was started on TYSABRI in Sep 2009 and was 
JCV (presume antibody) negative (specific date of testing unknown). The patient then converted to JCV (presume 
antibody) positive in 2014, with an index of 1.85 (specific date of testing unknown). The patient's index increased 
(date and index value not provided), so TYSABRI was discontinued in Apr 2014 (date discrepant with TOUCH

database). The neurologist reported that, subsequently, the patient received Rituxan (rituximab). In Sep 2014, an 
MRI showed non-enhancements in PONS and few new findings in brainstem. Additionally, the neurologist reported 
subtle symptomatic changes (NOS). The neurologist was informed that the patient was CSF JCV DNA positive 
(completed at(b) (6) ); however the neurologist has yet to confirm this lab result. Treatment for the event was not 
provided. The outcome of the event suspect PML is unknown. Causality for the event is unknown. TYSABRI 
therapy was discontinued.
Update 09 Oct 2014: Upon telephone follow-up with the neurologist, the neurologist reported that the female patient
has very aggressive MS. The patient discontinued TYSABRI in Apr 2014 due to increasing JCV antibody index. The
patient had no symptoms at that time. Rituximab was initiated after TYSABRI washout. The neurologist stated that, 
approximately one month ago, the patient experienced dizziness and ataxia and was hospitalized at her local 
hospital and treated by a different physician. An MRI and lumbar puncture were performed at the time of 
hospitalization in(b) (6)  The(b) (6)  reported that the patient was CSF JCV DNA positive, but the 
neurologist does not have a copy of the report and does not know how many copies/mL were detected. Additionally,
at the time of hospitalization, the patient was also found to have a UTI (onset unknown). The patient was treated 
with intravenous Solumedrol (methylprednisolone) followed by an oral steroid (NOS) taper, which was completed on
(b) (6)  The patient had improvement in her symptoms and was discharged (date of discharge unknown). 
Approximately 3 weeks ago, the patient had no symptoms. However, on 08 Oct 2014, the patient has new 
neurological symptoms of nystagmus, worsening of gait, and falls (presume symptoms of suspect PML). An MRI 
performed yesterday (08 Oct 2014) showed: new vague area (lesion) with no clear margins, non-enhancing, and is 
suspicious for PML - doesn't look like MS but "guess there's always a chance it might be MS." A repeat lumbar 
puncture is planned, most likely for 13 Oct 2014, and the sample will be sent to(b) (6)  for CSF JCV PCR testing. At
the time of this report, the patient remains at home. PLEX will not be initiated. The outcome of the urinary tract 
infection is unknown. Causality for the urinary tract infection was not assessed by the neurologist. 
Update 09 Oct 2014: The neurologist spontaneously re-reported via a Biogen Idec Representative that the female 
patient on TYSABRI from 01 Sep 2009 to 01 Apr 2014 (dates discrepant) started TYSABRI in Sep 2009 as JCV 
(presume antibody) negative, and then converted to JCV positive in 2014 with an index of 1.85. The patient's index 
increased so TYSABRI was stopped in Apr 2014. The patient experienced subtle symptom changes in Sep 2014 
(presumed symptoms of suspect PML). It was reported to the neurologist that the patient was CSF JCV DNA 
positive; however the neurologist has not confirmed this information with the lab. Causality for the event of suspect 
PML was assessed as possible.
Update 10 Oct 2014: MRI images from 17 Apr 2014 and 08 Oct 2014 were received from the neurologist; 
corresponding reports with findings were not provided (received images only).

Update 12 Oct 2014: The following serum JCV antibody results were obtained from (b) (6)
study: 07 Jul 2010 - detected (0.898 nOD); 04 Oct 2011 - detected (0.556 nOD); 27 Jan 2014 - positive (index 
2.06); 19 Mar 2014 - positive (index 2.23); 14 Jul 2014 - positive (index 2.8).
Update 14 Oct 2014: Upon telephone follow-up with the neurologist, the neurologist reported that the female patient
would be tapped today (14 Oct 2014) at a local hospital and CSF JCV PCR testing will be sent to (b) (6)  No further 
information was provided.
Update 29 Oct 2014: Upon written follow-up from the neurologist, the neurologist reported that the female patient's 
CSF JCV DNA ((b) (6) ) was positive at 276 copies. No further information was provided.
Update 06 Nov 2014: On 06 Nov 2014 Biogen Idec considers this case to be a confirmed case of PML based on 
positive CSF, radiologic evidence, and clinical symptoms.
Update 20 Jun 2015:  The neurologist reported  additional MRI scans from 29 Oct 2014, 08 Dec 2014, 21 Apr 2015,

Update 01 Jul 2015: Follow-up information was received via the (b) (6)  indicating that the latest CSF result (sample 
collected May 2015) was 77 copies of JCV.
Update 02 Jul 2015: Follow-up information received from a nurse practitioner reported the following CSF JCV 
results: 276 copies on 14 Oct 2014, 116 copies on 09 Dec 2014, 59 copies on 10 Feb 2015, and 77 copies on 12 
May 2015.
Update 29 Sep 2015: Additional information was received from a nurse practitioner from the neurologist's office via 
a MS Standardized PML Data Collection Tool.  The patient was alive, residing at home, and not currently on any 
MS therapy.  A brain MRI was performed on 21 Apr 2015 which showed scattered white matter lesions compatible 
with MS, mildly progressed since Feb 2014; T2 lesion burden was moderate, with two new lesions at the right 
parietal lobe and left middle cerebellar peduncle; T1 lesion burden was moderate, with two new lesions;  lesion 
enhancement: right parietal ring enhancement compatible with active inflammation; parenchymal loss: mild-to-
moderate generalized cerebral and moderate cerebellar atrophy, unchanged; and stable mild callosal volume loss. 
A brain MRI performed on 11 Aug 2015 indicated scattered white matter lesions compatible with MS; stable since 
Jun 2015; T2 lesion burden was moderate and stable; T1 lesion burden was moderate and stable; no lesion

enhancement; parenchymal loss: moderate generalized cerebral and severe cerebellar atrophy, stable; mild 
callosal volume loss unchanged. The patient's estimated Karnofsky and EDSS scores were assessed on 25 Aug 
2015 to be 70 (cares for self; unable to carry on normal activity or to do active work) and 6.5. At the time of this 
report, the patient had not recovered from PML.
