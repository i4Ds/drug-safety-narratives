AER 1512379 is a spontaneous case, received on 22/Dec/2014 from a physician via Agence Nationale de Securite 
duMedicament et des produits de Sante (ANSM) (France: MA20142572) and concerns a 77 year old male patient 
who had progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy and lymphopenia while being treated with rituximab 
(MabThera).
Patients concomitant medications included bendamustine hydrochloride and medical history, concurrent conditions 
and past drugs were not reported.
In 2014, the patient was hospitalized for atypical chronic lymphocytic leukemia. In Jul/2014, he started first course 
intravenous drip rituximab (therapy details not provided) and bendamustine hydrochloride for chronic lymphocytic 
leukemia. Later, he had hemiplegia with brachio cephalic predominance. On 10/Sep/2014, he was diagnosed with 
ischemic stroke in right superficial sylvian area. In Nov/2014, he had alteration of general condition with falls and

was bedridden because of worsening of hemiplegia and hemianopia. On 17/Nov/2014, he had fifth course of 
rituximab alone because of significant asthenia. On 03/Dec/2014, because of worsening the neurological state, an 
additional brain nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed and showed right ponto-occipital and 
left cerebellar multifocal bi frontal-callosal expansive process in contact with the 4th ventricle. Brain biopsy could 
not be performed because of a treatment with asprin DL-lysine. MRI was in favor of lymphomatous lesion. Later, he
underwent laboratory tests and results included leukopenia at 2.7 G/L, neutropenia at 1.4 G/L, lymphopenia at 0.85.
Ratio CD4/CD8 (lymphopenia CD8+) = 11.53 (Normal range: 1.6-2.4). Negative viral serology for herpes, varicella 
zoster virus (VZV), cytomegalovirus (CMV). On 05/Dec/2014, probabilistic treatment with 
sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim, aciclovir, methylprednisolone was given. Lumbar puncture with cytology and 
bacteria and virus screening was performed. On 08/Dec/2014, positive result of John Cunningham (JC) virus in 
cerebrospinal fluid: probable progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy which was life threatening. Diagnosis of 
progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy was made because of symptoms, serology and MRI. On 10/Dec/2014, 
decision to start plasmapheresis. Rituximab level testing was ongoing.
At the time of this report, the events progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy and lymphopenia were persisting. 
The reporter stated that there was a causal relationship between the events progressive multifocal 
leukoencephalopathy and lymphopenia and rituximab. 
French imputability for rituximab was chronology criteria (C2) semiological criteria (S2) intrinsic imputability (I2) 
concerning the events.
