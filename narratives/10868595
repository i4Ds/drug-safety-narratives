Case number PHEH2014US021229, is an initial report received from a nurse via patient oriented program Gilenya 
go (POP00002581) and Novartis patient assistance foundation (POP00001653) on 21 Oct 2014 and a follow up 
report received from a consumer (patient) on 05 May 2015.
This report refers to a 67-year-old female patient. The patient's historical conditions were not reported. The patient's
current condition included obesity. No concomitant medications were reported. The patient received Gilenya 
(fingolimod) (Lot: S0068A, S0090; Expiry: 07 Oct 2015) for multiple sclerosis from 21 Oct 2014 at a dose of 0.5 mg 
orally daily. The pre dose EKG was normal with heart rate of 72
On the same day, after Gilenya initiation, the patient felt dizzy and her heart rate was 48. The patient's radial pulse 
and blood pressure were fine. The nurse laid the patient down since the patient was feeling dizzy and tremulous. 
Her heart rate went up to approximately 99 and her radial pulse was not palpable. The patient felt really cold and 
her oxygen saturation decreased to 58. She was not perfusing (hypoperfusion), blood pressure probably dropped, 
so the patient was kept on a little oxygen. The patient's glucose/sugar levels were fine. The patient was noted to 
have hypertension, with reading of 200/100 (measured by electronic cuff). It was also reported that the patient's 
heart rate decreased to low 50's (54), however radial pulse was around 120 (details unspecified). The patient took 
Gilenya for 5 to 6 months. She suffered from headaches, being tired (fatigue) and heart palpitations. Her brain 
lesion account also went up (central nervous system lesion). The patient tested positive for JC (John Cunningham) 
virus. Therapy with Gilenya was stopped on an unknown date. The outcome of the events, fatigue, heart 
palpitations, central nervous system lesion, and positive for JC virus was not reported and was unknown for other 
events.
The events, headaches fatigue, heart palpitations, central nervous system lesion, and positive for JC virus were 
assessed for seriousness and other events were reported as serious (intervention required) by the nurse. Serious 
assessment of (central nervous system lesion, and positive for JC virus) was upgraded based on information 
available in the source document. The causality of the events was not reported.
Following an internal review of the information received on 21 Oct 2014, the following significant correction was 
done: Events not perfusing (hypoperfusion) and oxygen saturation decreased were coded and narrative was 
amended.
