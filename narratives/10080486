A nurse practitioner reported that a 32 year old male patient on TYSABRI (300 mg, IV, QM) for Multiple Sclerosis 
from unknown date to unknown date was hospitalized from an unknown date to an unknown date for PML (onset 
unknown). The patient presented in Mar 2014 with symptoms of fatigue, balance impairment, numbness, and visual
complaints (NOS). An exam revealed gait impairment, lower extremity weakness, diminished vibration sensation. 
Brain MRI on 31 Mar 2014 was negative for PML.  CSF collected on 31 Mar 2014 tested positive for JCV DNA at 16
copies. Treatment included Solumedrol (methylprednisolone) for three days for PML with some resolution of 
symptoms and the patient was admitted to the hospital for plasmapheresis. The outcome for the event PML is 
unknown. The causality for the event of PML is unknown.  It is unknown if TYSABRI treatment is ongoing.
Update 09 Apr 2014: Upon written follow-up from the neurologist, the patient was further identified and the age was 
clarified to be 31 years old.  At the time of this report, the patient had received 58 infusions of TYSABRI from 25

Aug 2009 to 13 Mar 2014.  On 27 Mar 2014, the patient underwent brain MRI with and without contrast which 
revealed extensive white matter disease consistent with MS, no enhancing lesions.  On 04 Apr 2014, the patient 
underwent brain MRI again.  The noted impressions were: "1. Subcortical diffusion signal and bubbly T2 signal in 
the left precentral gyrus, right parietal lobe and right more than left posterior temporal/occipital lobes. This is 
consistent with progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy. No enhancement to suggest immune reconstitution 
inflammatory syndrome at this time. 2. Findings compatible with severe chronic demyelination with interval 
progression of white matter disease, particularly seen in the right posterior temporal lobe and the left anterior 
temporal lobe. 3. Comparison with prior exam is difficult without diffusion-weighted images on prior study. Overall, 
there appears to be some progressive T2/FLAIR signal on today's study compared to prior exam, but differences is 
also be related to differences in technique. 4. T2 signal at the inferior medulla may cross the motor decussation and
could represent Wallerian degeneration versus a T2 hyperintense demyelinating lesion. This was present on 
outside exam."  The current treatment administered for PML is plasma exchange, the patient has completed 2 of 5 
cycles thus far, discontinuation of natalizumab, and initiation of mirtazepine 30 mg, PO, QAM.  The patient's clinical 
status was stable with absolutely no change in symptoms or signs.
Update 09 Apr 2014: JCV antibody results were obtained from the (b) (6)   On 19 Aug 2010, JCV 
was detected with a value of 0.571.  On 02 Sep 2011, JCV was detected with a value of 0.555.  On 26 Sep 2013, 
JCV was positive with an index of 1.83.  On 16 Jan 2014, JCV was positive with an index of 3.5.
Update 15 Apr 2014: In response to an outbound request, the neurologist's office provided MRI reports.  On 25 Aug
2010, the patient underwent MRI of the brain with and without contrast which revealed interval complete resolution 
of previously demonstrated ring enhancing 6 mm medial left temporal lobe lesion & tine punctate enhancing left 
frontal lobe lesion. No PML of distinctly new/enhancing supra or infratentorial MS lesions.  On 16 Aug 2011, the 
patient underwent MRI of the brain with and without contrast which revealed no interval change in size or signal 
characteristics of extensive confluent and multifocal demyelination lesions involving the cerebral white matter, 
thalami, midbrain, pons, bilateral  brachium pontis and bilateral cerebellar hemispheres without enhancement. No 
new white matter lesions, stable appearance of focal volume loss within the centrum semiovale, corona radiata and
cerebellar hemsipheres.  On 28 Mar 2014, the patient underwent MRI of the brain with and without contrast which 
revealed extensive and confluent demyelination lesions of cerebral white matter, thalami, midbrain, pons, bilteral 
brachium pontis, bilateral cerebellar hemisphres and medulla show no change in number or configuration. Minimal 
contrast enhancement of subccorttial white matter left posterior frontal lobe.
Update 24 Apr 2014: Biogen Idec considers this case to be a confirmed case of PML based on positive JCV DNA 
and consistent detailed MRI findings.

Therapy, reported that he had his last TYSABRI infusion on 13 Mar 2014 and was diagnosed with PML at the end 
of Mar 2014.  He was taken off TYSABRI.  The patient was treated with a blood transfusion to clear the TYSABRI 
out (presumed previously reported plasma exchange).  The patient stated that he is feeling like crap.  Regarding 
the recovery from PML the patient did not provide any further clarification other than to say that PML is like MS in 
that it has no cure.
Update 11 Nov 2014: An advanced practice registered nurse from the neurologist's office reported via a TOUCH 
Discontinuation Questionnaire that the office had previously reported that the patient had experienced PML. The 
reporter also noted that the patient had tested positive for the presence of anti-JCV antibodies sometime since 27 
Feb 2014. No further information was provided.
Update 18 Jun 2015:  In response to a reconciliation request, the TOUCH enrollment was accessed and it was 
noted that patient received Novantrone (mitoxantrone) from Sep 2005 to Feb 2008.  The patient experienced first 
MS symptoms on 30 Aug 2005.
