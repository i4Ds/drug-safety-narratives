Lee HC, Mulanovich V, Nieto Y. Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy after allogeneic bone marrow 
transplantation for acute myeloid Leukemia. J-Natl-Compr-Canc-Netw 2014; 12(12) 1660-1664 
Two men 69 year old man developed progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy following treatment with 
methylprednisolone, mycophenolate mofetil, cyclophosphamide, pentostatin and tacrolimus [ not all dosages stated,
routes not stated for all ]. The man underwent allogenic bone marrow transplantation (BMT) for acute 
myelomonocytic leukaemia. Post transplant he recieved cyclophosphamide 50 mg/kg on day 3 and 4, and 
tacrolimus for immunosuppression. On day 55 of transplant he developed steroid-refractory grade III acute skin and
colon graft-versus-host disease. He was treated with methylprednisolone 2 mg/kg and mycophenolate mofetil. Due 
to an inadequate response, mycophenolate mofetil was discontinued and pentostatin 1.5 mg/m 2 was started on 
days 1 through day 3. Due to improvement in the condition tacrolimus and prednisone were completely tapered off 
by post transplant day 140. On day 315 he developed expressive aphasia and right upper extremity dyspraxia. 
Qualitative CSF PCR was positive for JCV confirming the diagnosis of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy.
His absolute CD4+ T-cell count was low at 178 cells/microL. The man was treated with mefloquine, mirtazapine and
immunoglobulin. Due to irreversible neurological damage the man was transferred to hospice care and he died on 
post transplant day 361.
