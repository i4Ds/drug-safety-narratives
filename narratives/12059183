This report from the literature summarized data from the American Association of Poison Control Centers National 
Poison Data Systems (NPDS) 2014 Annual Report. Poison Center (PC) cases with medical outcome of death were 
evaluated by a team of medical and clinical toxicologist reviewers using an ordinal scale of 1-6 to assess the 
Relative Contribution to Fatality (RCF) of the exposure to the death. Exposure-related fatalities included RCF=1 
undoubtedly responsible; RCF=2 probably responsible; RCF=3 contributory.
Table 21 listed fatal cases for which there existed reasonable confidence that the death was a result of that 
exposure (exposure-related fatalities). Of the 1835 reports of deaths, 1408 were judged to be exposure-related 
fatalities (RCF 1, 2 or 3).  The remaining 467 cases were judged as RCF=4 probably not responsible, RCF=5 
clearly not responsible; or RCF=6 unknown. 
This case is regarding a 5 year old female, identified as Annual Report ID (b) (6)  in Table 21, who died following 
chronic ingestion of acetaminophen and an unknown drug.  RCF was assessed as 2. Reason for exposure was

reported to be unknown. Blood acetaminophen concentration 8 hours post exposure was 17.6 mcg/mL.  Specific 
cause of death was not reported.
The authors summarized that these data support the continued value of PC expertise and need for specialized 
medical toxicology information to manage the more severe exposures, despite a decrease in cases involving less 
severe exposures. Poison centers must consider newer communication approaches that match current public 
communication patterns in addition to the traditional telephone call.
