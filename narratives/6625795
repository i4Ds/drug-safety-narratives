This special surveillance (H3E-JE-AX01, PMS Non-Interventional) case, concerns a 70-year-old Asian male. The 
patient had a history of asbestos exposure, interstitial king disease and pulmonary fibrosis. He was diagnosed with 
pleural mewl  '  a malignant (MPM, his.n n e:0 OaiS:  o je type. stage IV) with pleural effusion and 
metastases to contralateral pleura. He had no histories of chemotherapy, radiotherapy, surgery and any other 
treatments for MPM. He was suffering from asbestosis, diabetes mellitus, gastritis, hypertension, constipation, 
cancer pain and chronic respiratory failure. He received 00  ;  diary oxygen therapy (2 Lirnin).for dys0 ! 0  due to 
MPM:from Feb-2008 and multiple concomitant medications including folic acid and vitamin B1:2. As of 28-Feb-
2008, chest X-ray showed findings of interstitial lung disease (ILE)) and auscultation showed no remarkable 
findings. Saturation of oxygen (Sp02) was 97% on oxygen. As of 25-Mar-2008, performance status at initiation of 
pm 0; 0 n on the EOCG/Zubrod scale was 1. Base line lab data on 25-Mar-2008 was as follows: body temperature 
(BT). 35,8 degrees Celsius (0/C), white b10 6  cell (WBC)7il ! ; L, lactate dehydrogenase (LOH) 291 lU/L, 
potassium (K) 4.8 inEq/L, oxygen saturation (S002) .99%. Chest X-ray showed locally glanckgrass opacity in 
unilateral .. lung fields. The patient received pemetrexed disodiuni (Alimta) 500 rriginr2 in combination with 
01 75 inglre2 .both intravenously (iv) fork4PM, begi on 25-Mar-2008 during his alization. On 26- 
Mar-2008: chest X-ray showed locally gland-grass opacity in unilateral lower lung fields. Sp02 was 99%. On 27-
Mar-2008, three days after the first and last dose, he developed queasy and palpitation. Sp02 was 95%. On 31-
Mar-2008, volume of oxygen was increased up to 3 Lhnin. On 01-Apr-2008, eight days after the first and last dose, 
a was .00-...7vateci and he was diagnosed with interstitial pneurnonitis (IP) by chest X-ray and CT. Steroid 
pulse therapy (inethylprednisolone 1000mg iv) was started and the study drugs were discontinued. Volume of 
oxygen was increased up to 7 Limin. Lab data was as follows: BT 37.1 ANC, WBC 6500/m,cL, ION 383 IU/L, K 3.5

vernent of IP. He received artificial respirator due to aggravation of respiratory condition. Neutrophil elastase

P aCO2, Fi02 and.PIF ratio were 100%, 114.4 Tom 64.5 Torr. 60% and 177, respectively. On 09-Apr-2008, X-ray

respectively. On 12-Apr-2008, steroid was switched to precionisolone.60rng iv. On the same day, he d1e: .v0  .  
sarious.byporkalsiernia (seriousness reported as life-threatening) and electrocardiogram (EGG) showed ventricular 
tachycardia. LMW heparin was dis z .0  and sodium polystyrene sulfonate and glucose-insulin.therapy (human 
insulin 24-40 unit/clay and 10% glucose tn, 500-1500 ml,/day:) was started. Lab data was as follows: BT 37_5

On 17-Apr-2008, IP was improved. Sp02, Pa02, PaCO2, Fi02 and P/F ratio were 100%, 106.5 Torr, 62 Torr, 45%

respectively: On 22-Apr-2008, artificial respirator was removed because respiratory condition was improved. He 
received oxygen-a Lirnin by mask and Sp02 was 97%. On 23-Apr-2008, Sp02 was 92% and he died of disease 
progression (POI No autopsy was pert. '  Attempted to obtainicit/control number, information was unknown. 
The investigator considered the IP was related to pemetrexed and: did. not know the causality between the IP and 
cisplatin. He considered the hyperkalaerrtia was unrelated to the study drugs. No further information was expected.
