FOIA Case Report Information
Update 14 Dec 2013:  Additional information received.  Follow-up received from the neurologist via a Biogen Idec 
Medical Science Liaison (MSL) confirmed that the patient is positive for PML by symptoms, MRI, and spinal tap.
No further information provided.
Update 16 Dec 2013:  Additional information received.  The neurologist reported that the patient started 
experiencing symptoms 4 -5 weeks ago with left arm weakness, and is currently in the hospital (presumed from 
(b) (6) ).  The patient is TYSABRI antibody negative and JCV positive.  Testing included an MRI "within 2-4 
weeks of new onset symptoms" which was abnormal (previously reported) and showed new MS plaque, and a 
lumbar puncture which was positive for CSF JCV DNA "6,000 or so".  Treatment included IV steroids (NOS), 
intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), and plasma exchange (PLEX).  The patient is currently stable.  No further 
information provided.
Update 18 Dec 2013: Upon internal review, Biogen Idec considers this case to be confirmed for PML based on 
positive CSF and internal review of MRI images from 15 Nov 2013 which were consistent with unilobar PML, non-
enhancing.
