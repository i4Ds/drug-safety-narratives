A neurologist reported that a male patient on TYSABRI (unknown dose, IV, unknown frequency) for relapsing 
remitting Multiple Sclerosis from unknown date to unknown date was hospitalized from an unknown date to an 
unknown date for PML (onset 28 Jun 2014). The event of PML is ongoing. The causality for the event of PML is 
unknown.  TYSABRI therapy was discontinued.
Update 17 Jul 2014:   A neurologist reported via a data collection form that the 38 year old male patient currently 
resides in a hospital. The patient was diagnosed with MS on 05 Apr 1999.  The patient has not received prior 
immunosuppressant therapy.  Past immunomodulatory therapy that the patient received included AVONEX 
(interferon beta-1a) for MS 30 mcg IM 1QW from 29 Nov 2006 to 17 Oct 2007 and Rebif  (interferon beta-1a) for 
MS 44mcg SC 3 TIW from 17 Oct 2007 to 01 Jun 2010.  The patient started TYSABRI on 01 Sep 2010 and 
stopped on 15 Jul 2014, with the patient's last TYSABRI dose on 13 Jun 2014.  The patient has not experienced an 
interruption of TYSABRI therapy for a time period greater than 3 months.  Prior to the PML diagnosis the patient's 
MS symptoms included motor and focal symptoms in the form of left hemiparesis on 05 Mar 2004 and visual 
symptoms in the form of left "ON" (presumed optic neuritis) on 06 Feb 1999.  The patient tested positive for anti-
JCV antibodies 08 Jul 2011.  A MRI was performed on 01 Jan 2014 prior to the PML diagnosis with the results not 
reported. The pre-TYSABRI CBC results were not available.  The patient tested positive for anti-JCV antibodies 10 
Feb 2014.  The neurologist reported that on 28 Jul 2014 that patient began to experience PML symptoms relate to 
speech which included transcortical aphasia, visual symptoms included right lower quadrantanopia, and cerebellar 
symptoms included truncal ataxia, dysarthria the onset for the reported symptoms was 28 Jun 2014. A MRI was 
performed at the time of PML diagnosis on 11 Jul 2014 with the results not reported.  The patient underwent a 
lumbar puncture on 16 Jul 2014 that had the CSF sample tested the same day 16 Jul 2014 with inconclusive 
results.  The CSF analysis on 16 Jul 2014 was abnormal with high protein concentration without any cells.  A brain 
biopsy has not been performed.  The CBC pre-PLEX values tested on 16 Jul 2014 were Lymph[ocytes] 1.9 
(reference range = 1.2 - 3.6), neu[trophils] 15.5 (reference range = 2.8 - 11.0), and mono[cytes] 0.7 (reference 
range 0 - 0.8).  The patient received a total of 3 PLEX sessions on 17 Jul 2014, 18 Jul 2014, and 21 Jul 2014, with 
a total volume of 5.6 Lt each session with no immunoadsorption (IA).  Treatment medication included 
Corticosteroids 5 gr IV 5 days once a day from 30 Jun 2014 to 06 Jul 2014.  The patient has not been enrolled in a 
Biogen Idec clinical trial or in a non Biogen Idec clinical trial.  The event of PML is ongoing. PML has not been ruled 
out.  The causality for the event of PML is related to TYSABRI.  TYSABRI therapy was discontinued.
Update 25 Jul 2014: Additional information was provided via a DCT form. The neurologist reported that the JCV 
DNA local lab result from 16 Jul 2014 was 11,200 copies/mL. The lower limit of detection is 5000 copies/mL. The 
patient also tested JCV DNA positive in the blood on 10 Feb 2014. The patient is HIV negative (tested on 16 Jul 
2014). The MRI at the time of PML suspicion was performed on 11 Jul 2014 compared to the prior MRI from 01 Jan
2014; results were not provided. Prior to TYSABRI on 12 Mar 2010, the patient's EDSS was 3.5 and Karnofsky 
socre was 80. On TYSABRI prior to PML (16 Apr 2014), EDSS was 4.0 and Karnofsky was 80. At the time of PML

diangosis (15 Jul 2014), EDSS was 6.0 and Karnofsky was 50. The patient remained hospitalized. Outocme was 
reported as unknown. Causality was related. 
Update 25 Jul 2014: The neurologist reported in response to an outbound query that the patient was Polyoma JCV 
and BKV PCR (CSF) positive 11.200 copy/mL (previously reported), Polyoma JCV DNA was detected, Polyoma 
virus JCV DNA test has showed a value under the lineer [linear] threshold.  The follow-up of copy number increase 
could help to diagnosis and treatment of the "enfections" (presumed infections).  The lineer [linear] threshold of the 
test is between 50.000 - 500.000.000 copy/ mL.  The lowest detection limit of the test is 5000 copy/mL. 
Update 28 Jul 2014: A neurologist reported that the CSF JCV collected on 16 Jul 2014 tested positive at 4994 
copies/mL from (b) (6) .
Update 26 Aug 2014:  The neurologist reported that following plasmapheresis therapy for three days as an 
inpatient, the patient's clinical and radiological progression continued.  The patient was diagnosed with pneumonia 
and respiratory insufficiency (onset unknown). On (b) (6)  the patient was referred to the intensive care unit 
due to the symptoms.  It is unknown whether the events pneumonia and respiratory insufficiency are ongoing.
Causality was not reported.  No further information was reported. 
Update 04 Sep 2014: Upon internal review, Biogen Idec considers this case to be confirmed based on positive CSF
and clinical symptoms.
Update 15 Sep 2014: The neurologist reported that the patient died on (b) (6)   No further information was 
reported.
Update 01 Oct 2014: The neurologist reported that the patient died of multi-organ failure due to sepsis on (b) (6)
