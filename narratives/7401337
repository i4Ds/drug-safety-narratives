the patient completed the radiation therapy. The patient was discharged that same day. He had been afebrile on 
amoxiefiliniclavulanate for 48 hours at the time of discharge. Discharge laboratory values included Hgb 10.1, Het 
31.5, fait 418 and WBC 7.8. In the opinion of the investigator, the hemoptysis was related to-bevacizumab and not 
related to pernetrexed, carboplatin or protocol procedures. The investigator stated the he -.00;v ',. was most likely

Event/P Narrative: 
This surveillance (H3E-JE-HS01, PMS non-interventional) case, concerns a 67-year-old male. The patient 
was suffering from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), dyslipidaemia, hyperuricaemia, diabetes 
mellitus and hypertension. He had a medical history of acute myocardial infarction and pneumonia. He had a 
smoking habit (20 cigarettes per day for 41 years) and drug allergy to olopatadine. He was diagnosed with non-
small cell lung cancer (NSCLC, adenocarcinoma, stage IV). He did not receive surgery, chemotherapy, 
radiotherapy or other therapies for NSCLC. He concomitantly received multiple drugs including folic acid and 
vitamin 1312. On 26-Aug-2009, no abnormal finding was conf in chest X-ray or computerized la *cram (CT) 
scan images. On 08-Sep-2009, his white blood cell count (WBC) was 13100/mm3 and c-reactive protein (CRP) 
was 4.71 mg/d1. On 10-Sep-2009, oxygen saturation (Sp02) was 97%. The patient received pemetrexed disodium 
(Alimta) 900 mg and cisplatin 135 mg both intravenously for NSCLC as first line beginning on 10-Sep-2009. 
Azasetron and dexamethasone were also started for 10110 ive therapy. On 01-Oct-2009, 26-Oct-2009 and 19-

Nov-2009, he received the study drugs. The study drugs were discontinued as the planned course was completed. 
On 06--lan-2010, no abnormal finding was confirmed in chest X-ray images. On aboutqamonth 
alter the last administration of the study  6' , he developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). On I. 
ailliliaboutilipbrnonth after the last administration of the study drugs, he developed interstitial lung disease 
OA. Ground glass oppacity was observed in upper, middle and lower part of the left lung in chest X-ray images 
and shadow was observed in upper, middle and lower part of the left lung in CT scan images. His Sp02 
was 95%, body temperature was 37.0 degrees Celsius and CRP was 11.50 ing/dL. Steroid pulse therapy with 
rnethylprednisolone sodium succinate was started as corrective treatement but it did not work. On and 
111111111111111  mind glass oppacity was still observed in upper, middle and lower part of the left lung in chest X-ray 
s. Sp02 was 83 % and body temperature was 35.6 degrees Celcius. He died of ARDS and 
ILD. It was not provided if an autopsy was done. The study investigator stated that it was unknown whether the 
both events were related to pemetrexed. The investigator considered that the ARDS might be related to cisplatin 
and patient's concurrent disease COPO and that ILD might be related to cisplatin and the patient's previous disease 
pilelitTIORia. Further information was requested. Updated on 24-Aug-2010: Additional information received on 23-
A g-201-0. Added the lab data, information about treatment drug, Changed the date of pemetrexed administration 
and step dated of a concomitant drug. Changed the patient's demographics. Updated the narrative and relevant 
fields.
