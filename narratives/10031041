MEDICALLY SIGNIFICANT
On 27 Jan 2014
A neurologist spontaneously reported that a 31 year old female patient on TYSABRI (IV, QM, 300mg) for 4 years 
(exact start date not provided) for multiple sclerosis presented with difficulties in speaking and walk disorders 
appeared 1 month ago in Dec 2013 leading to suspect a PML. 
Other relevant medical history apart from MS, concomitant treatment and prior MS treatment were not provided. It 
was unknown if the patient had been treated with immunosuppressant prior to TYSABRI. Risk factors included 
TYSABRI treatment for more than 2 years and positive JCV antibodies.
In Sep 2013, MRI was normal. The patient presented with difficulties in speaking and walk disorders appeared 1 
month ago in Dec 2013 which worsened since they occurred.
In Dec 2013, MRI was not interpretable. In Jan 2014, MRI revealed sus thalamic lesions a typical for PML atypical

for MS. On 27 Jan 2013, lumbar puncture was performed and CSF sample was sent to (b) (6)  for JCV PCR testing.
At the time of reporting, the event was ongoing. TYSABRI was withdrawn on an unknown date in Dec 2013 (date of 
the last infusion).
French Imputability : C1 S1 I1
Update 12 Mar 2014: Additional information received from the treating physician reported that the results of the 
lumbar puncture performed on (b) (6)  and sent to (b) (6)  was positive [for JCV]. 
French Imputability : C2S2I2 
Update 21 Mar 2014: Additional information was received from the treating neurologist via a MS Standardized PML 
Data Collection Tool. The patient?s MS symptoms first appeared in Jan 2002 and she was diagnosed with MS in 
Jan 2007. MS disease symptoms prior to PML diagnosis were cerebellar with ataxia and sensory (focal) showing 
left hand dysesthesia. Previous MS therapy included AVONEX from 01 Jun 2008 to 01 Jun 2009. No prior use of 
immunosuppressive agents was reported. TYSABRI was initiated on 01 Jan 2008 and stopped on 20 Dec 2013. 
The first PML signs appeared around Nov-Dec [2013] and were characterized as speech disorders, mainly aphasia.
The neurologist mentioned that several brain MRIs were performed around the time of PML suspicion: on 01 Sep 
2013, 20 Dec 2013, (b) (6) , (b) (6) , and on 07 Mar 2014 (previously reported). The neurologist reported
that the results of the MRI revealed a new lesion in the left thalamus that was high signal in T2 and FLAIR 
sequences and assessed to be PML compatible. The patient tested positive for serum anti-JCV antibody on an 
unknown date. The neurologist assessed the patient?s estimated Karnofsky scores as follows: on 01 Dec 2009 to 
be 70 (cares for self; unable to carry on normal activity or to do active work), on 01 Oct 2013 to be 70, and on (b)(6)  
(b) (6)  to be 60 (requires occasional assistance, but is able to care for most of her personal needs). EDSS 
scores were assessed on 03 Feb 2010 to be 4, on 21 Oct 2013 to be 2.5, and on 27 Jan 2014 to be 5.5. The 
lumbar puncture performed on (b) (6)  and sent for JCV PCR testing at (b) (6)  returned positive with 1978 
copies/mL. CSF sample analysis also revealed a cell count of 1 leukocyte/mm3, protein in CFS 0.28 g/L, glucose in
CSF 2.91 mmol/L.  The neurologist evaluated the patient's PML diagnosis to be confirmed. Additionally, the patient 
experienced an IRIS based on MRI findings (onset date 25 Feb 2014). The neurologist reported that the clinical 
signs and symptoms of the IRIS were "hard to say" and the event was ongoing. Treatment included 
methylprednisone 10 grams, mirtazapine 30 mg (started on 13 Feb 2014 and still ongoing), and plasma exchanges 
were performed on (b) (6) (b) (6)  and (b) (6)  As of (b) (6)  the patient was in the hospital 
and her EDSS was 9.5. Clinical condition included hemiplegia, mutism and dysphagia. Causality for the events of 
PML and IRIS were not provided.

Update 27 Mar 2014 : Biogen Idec considers this case to be a confirmed case of PML based on positive CSF, MRI,
and clinical symptoms.
Update 06 May 2014:  Additional information was provided by the prescribing physician.  The physician reported 
that the patient passed away "approximately (b)(6)  days ago" (presume 
(b) (6) ) because of PML.  No further 
information was provided by the physician.

Update 26 Jun 2014: A report was received from French Regulatory Authority (ANSM via CRPV with reference 
number MA20141227) concerning the patient who was hospitalized from (b) (6)  to (b) (6)  for PML. The
patient's RRMS symptoms started since 1998  and she was diagnosed in 2007. Past medication included AVONEX
for 9 months from 2007 to 2008. TYSABRI, initiated in 2008, was well tolerated and the patient had no MS relapses
since treatment was started. The patient had never received immunosuppressive treatment. A MRI on 23 Dec 2013
showed 2 new hypersignals. One of them appeared to affect the left thalamus, at which date the patient presented 
with speech impediment evolving for a month. The patient refused the lumbar puncture and TYSABRI was 
discontinued. On (b) (6)  the patient was hospitalized for a major asthenia, feeling of strangeness, increase of
preexisting balance disorders (ataxic walking known) and worsening of language disorders. A clinical examination 
on (b) (6)  showed: slight attention and concentration disorders, comprehension and speech disorders 
(Wernicke aphasia) and paraphasias and anterograde amnesia. There was no sensitivo-motor deficit, no 
oculomotor deficit and no visual field abnormality. Bilateral kinetic cerebellar syndrome in upper limbs and static 
with ataxic walking, and dysarthria. Biological analysis and EEG were normal. A brain MRI on (b) (6)  with 
FLAIR and diffusion was similar to those of Dec 2013. Hyperintense signal in diffusion imaging in the occipital 
region with ADC attenuation (diffusion coefficient). Hyperintense lesions with inflammatory appearance in the 
posterior fossa especially in the left cerebellar peduncle, in the brain stem and in the supratentoriel white matter 
bilaterally in the para and supraventricular  region. CSF analysis was normal and JC virus PCR in CSF was 
positive. PML was diagnosed and 4 plasma exchanges were performed in (b) (6)  On (b) (6)  the patient 
was discharged with Norset (mirtazapine). From (b) (6)  to (b) (6)  and then from(b) (6)  to (b)(6)  
(b) (6)  the patient was hospitalized for neurological worsening. 2 times 3 courses of Solu Medrol 
(methylprednisolone) were initiated. A transient improvement was observed but the patient also experienced a 
worsening of aphasia and preexisting deficit of right hemibody. The patient could not walk or feed. On (b) (6)
the patient was hospitalized again following a new neurological worsening. On (b) (6)  an EEG revealed a 
diffuse brain damage with left predominance of subcortical origin. Maraviroc was initiated (300 mg twice a day) 
without improvement. On(b) (6)  the patient experienced pauses in breathing. On (b) (6)  the patient 
presented iterative bilious vomiting. On (b) (6)  MRI showed an increase of lesions in the posterior fossa
