Initial information regarding this unsolicited case from United States received on 19-Oct-2015 from a physician.
This case concerns a male patient of unknown age who experienced stroke, an unknown duration after receiving 
alirocumab (Praluent).
No past drugs, medical history or concurrent conditions were reported.
On an unknown date, the patient initiated treatment with alirocumab (75 mg/ml) at a dose of 75mg (form, route, 
frequency, lot/batch number and expiry date unspecified) delivered via its prefilled pen for high cholesterol.
Sometime thereafter (onset date and latency: unknown), the patient had a stroke. The doctor was not sure if the 
stroke was due to alirocumab, but the doctor did want the event reported. The doctor had stated that the patient 
had very high cholesterol and it could be a coincidence.
