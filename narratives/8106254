INITIAL INFORMATION FOR THIS SUMMARY LITERATURE CASE WAS RECEIVED ON 22 AUGUST 2011 AND 
CONCERNS A GROUP OF 38 PATIENTS SOME OF WHOM EXPERIENCED ONE OR MORE OF THE 
FOLLOWING ADVERSE EVENTS: ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, RESPIRATORY DISTRESS, NEUTROPENIA, 
FATIGUE, PNEUMONIA AND THROMBOEMBOLIC EVENTS WHILE ENROLLED IN 2 OPEN-LABEL PHASE II 
STUDIES (STANDFORD AND PASSPORT) OT INVESTIGATE THE SAFETY AND EFFICACY OF 
BEVAC1ZUMAB AND PEMETREXED AS 2ND-LINE THERAPY AFTER A PLATINUM DOUBLET IN ADVANCED 
NONSQUAMOUS NSCLC PATIENTS WITH BRAIN METASTASES. SIXTEEN PATIENTS (MEDIAN AGE 60 
YR, RANGE 33-74 YR) ON STANDFORD STUDY AND 22 PATIENTS (MEDIAN AGE 60 YR, RANGE 33-74 YR) 
ON PASSPORT STUDY WERE TREATED WITH PREMETREXED (500 MG/SQ.M) AND BEVACIZUMAB (15 
IAG/KG) ON DAY 1 OF EACH 3 WK CYCLE. NO CNS BLEEDING EVENTS WERE NOTED. TWO GRADE 5 
ADVERSE EVENTS (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE AND RESPIRATORY DISTRESS) AND 3 GRADE 4 ADVERSE 
EVENTS (NEUTROPENIA, SEVERE FATIGUE AND PNEUMONIA) WERE OBSERVED. THERE WERE 2 
THROMBOEMBOLIC EVENTS REQUIRING ANTICOAGULATION. THERE WAS INSUFFICIENT INFORMATION 
REGARDING THE OUTCOME OF THE EVENTS ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, RESPIRATORY DISTRESS, 
NEUTROPENIA, FATIGUE, PNEUMONIA AND THROMBOEMBOLIC EVENTS AND THE THERAPY ONGOING 
STATUS OF BEVACIZUMAB AND PEMETREXED. THE AUTHORS DESCRIBED ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, 
RESPIRATORY DISTRESS, NEUTROPENIA, FATIGUE, PNEUMONIA AND THROMBOEMBOLIC EVENTS AS 
THE ADVERSE EVENTS OF BEVACIZUMAB AND PEMETREXED THERAPY. THE COMPANY ASSESSED THE 
GRADE 5 EVENTS OF ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, RESPIRATORY DISTRESS, GRADE 4 EVENTS OF 
NEUTROPENIA, FATIGUE, PNEUMONIA AND THE THROMBOEMBOLIC EVENTS AS MEDICALLY 
SIGNIFICANT. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION HAS BEEN REQUESTED. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION WAS 
RECEIVED ON 24 AUGUST 2011: THE REPORTER DETAILS WERE UPDATED. TWO OPEN-LABEL PHASE H 
STUDIES (STANDFORD AND PASSPORT) INVESTIGATED THE SAFETY AND EFFCACY OF BEVACIZUMAB 
AND PEMETREXED AS SECOND-LINE THERAPY AFTER A PLATINUM DOUBLET IN ADVAN CED NON 
SQUAMOUS NSCLC WITH BRAIN METASTASES. IN ONE STUDY, THIS COMBINATION WAS USED 
EXCLUSIVELY (STANFORD STUDY). THE OTHER TRIAL INCLUDED BOTH FIRST AND SECOND-LINE 
COMBINAT e  BEVACIZUMAB AND PEMETREXED IN COMBINATION WAS ONE OF SEVERAL OPTIONS 
FOR SECOND LINE USE AT THE INVESTIGATOR'S DISCRETION (PASSPORT STUDY). IN THE STANFORD 
STUDY, PATENTS WERE ELIGIBLE IF THEIR CNS DISEASE WAS RADIOGRAPHICALLY STABLE AT LEAST 
ONE MONTH AFTER RADIATION OR SURGERY AND THEY NO LONGER REQUIRED STEROIDS. IN 
PASSPORT, PATIENTS WERE ELIGIBLE 3 MONTHS AFTER CNS SURGERY OR 1 WEEK AFTER 
COMPLETION OF RADIATION ALONE PROVIDED IMAGING WITHIN 1 WEEK OF TREATMENT INITIATION 
S ED NO CNS PROGRESSION OR HEMORRHAGE. THOUGH CYTOTOXIC TREATMENT COULD START 
1 WEEK AFTER RADIATION, BEVACIZUMAB WAS WITHHELD UNTIL AT LEAST 4 WEEKS AFTER 
RADIATION WAS COMPLETED. SIXTY SIX % PATIENTS HAD ADENOCARCINOMA, 13% HAD LARGE CELL 
CARCINOMA, AND 21% HAD OTHER PATHOLOGY. PATIENTS RECEIVED A MEDIAN OF 6 CYCLES OF
