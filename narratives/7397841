This non-Lilly clinical trial case , reported by an investigator via a subsidiary company (manufacturer 
number 10-11-00092/ protocol ) concerns a 49 year old Caucasian male. Medical history included non- 
small cell lung cancer diagnosed on 10-Nov-2009 with osseous and adrenal metastases, pulmonary embolism on 
111111111111111.and mucositis on 04-Dec-2009 (non-serious). Concomitant medications included: diclofenac, 
lansoprazole, enoxaparin sodium, and supplementation with folic acid; it was not specified if the patient received 
supplementation with vitamin 812. On 30-Nov-2009, the patient first received pemetrexed (Alimta) 652 mg, 
intravenously (IV), once every three weeks, I MC-11F8 (rh anti-EGFR mab), 800 mg, IV, on days 1 and 8 every 
three weeks, and cisplatin, 130 mg IV, once every three weeks, all for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer. 
The date of the last dose of pemetrexed and cisplatin, prior to event onset, was 06-Apr-2010 (infusion 6) and IMC-
11F8 was 13-Apr-2010 (infusion 11). This was also reported as the last scheduled administration of IMC-11F8 as 
treatment would not be given at a later date due to a non-serious event of mucositis (no further details). On 13-Apr-
2010, a routine computerized tomography (CT) of the thorax and abdomen showed no signs of relapse with 
detectable PR continuing. The patient had completed six cycles of study therapy with the three study drugs. On 06-
May-2010, the patient developed left hemiplegia and cerebral ischaemia was diagnosed. On 
approximately upm onth after the last dose of pemetrexed and cisplatin, and Ways after the ast dose of IMC-
11F8, the patient was hospitalised for the diagnosed cerebral ischemia, grade three. Tests performed on the

admission date included: a CT that revealed gram cerebral showing no metastases, bleeding or ischemia. A CT of 
the thorax showed a flattened diaphragm on the right side; a discrete mediastinal shadow right side; and a discrete 
mediastinal shadow right sided potentially compatible with an infiltrate. On the patient was 
transferred to the hospital of his treating investigator. On the same day, IM 1F8 was eld secondary to the 
hemiplegia, and treatment with dexamethasone was started. On laboratory tests results revealed 
hemoglobin 14.0 g/dL (14.0-17.5), hematocrit 39.9% 36.0-48.2), re ood cells 4.6 (4.5-5.9), white blood cells 
22.77 (4.40-11.30), neutrophils 91.5% (45-74), absolute neutrophils 20.84 (1.4-6.6), lymphocytes 3.4% (22-54.5), 
absolute lymphocytes 0.78, platelet count 195 (150-450), international normalized ratio (INR) 1.1 (2.0-3.5), sodium 
138 mmol/L (135-150), potassium 4.3 mmol/L (3.6-5.5), chloride 104 mmol/L (95-110), calcium 2.15 mmol/L (2.10-
2.65), magnesium 1.20 mmol/L (0.73-1.06), creatinine 1.07 mg/dl (<1.25), blood urea nitrogen (BUN) 30 mg/dL (8-
20), bilirubin 0.36 mg/dL (0.1-1.2), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) 844 (<248), glucose 103 mg/dL (70-110), 
aspartate aminotransferase 57 (<35), alanine aminotransferase 37 (<45), gamma-glutamyltransferase 85 (<55) 
alkaline phosphatase 248 (<129), C-reactive protein 0.74 mg/dL (<0.8), triglycerides 375 mg/dL (<200) and 
cholesterol 371 mg/dL (<200). A cerebral magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was planned secondary to 
questionable stroke, ischemia and "space-occupying mass". On 11111111111111 he underwent cranial MRI consisting 
of magnetic resonance angiography, MRI of the brain and magnetic resonance diffusion study, which revealed 
multiple bilateral supra- and infratentorial lesions, most likely ischemic and probably embolic origin, and a 4 mm 
metastatic lesion in the hippocampus. The patient was diagnosed with grade 3 cerebral ischemia which the 
investigator considered caused the hemiplegia. On 11111111111111, labs were significant for: INR 1.2, BUN 28, LDH 
1153, aspartate aminotransferase 97, Gamma-glutamyltransferase 96, alkaline phosphatase 326, C-reactive 
protein 10.8, and creatinine kinase 575 (additional labs in source document). The investigator confirmed the patient 
did not show any clinical or morphological signs of cerebrovascular or arteriosclerotic disease prior to study entry; 
the patient had no risk factors for arteriosclerotic disease, no clinical signs of any other forms of arteriosclerotic 
disease, and no history of cardiac arrhythmias prior to study; and the pulmonary embolism (which started 18-Nov-
2009), did not worsen during the study participation, and was not considered an adverse event (recovered 18-Jan-
2010). Treatment included dexamethasone and acetylsalicylic acid. Other treatment medications included:
dalteparin sodium, paracetamol, hydromorphone, macrogol, haloperidol, metamizole, and ceftriaxone. On a mp 
111111111the patient expired. The investigator considered the grade 3 cerebral ischemia to be the primary cause of 
death, An autopsy was not performed. Information provided on the death certificate was pending. Prior to the 
patient's death, therapy with IMC-11F8 had been previously held (10May10); no action was taken with pemetrexed 
and cisplatin. The patient was withdrawn from the study due to the fatal event of cerebral ischaemia on 11111. 
alp The investigator assessed the fatal cerebral ischemia to be possibly related to the use of pemetrexed, IMC-
11F8, and cisplatin and unlikely to be related to protocol procedures. The subsidiary company considered the 
events of cerebral ischemia and the hemiplegia, most probably resulting from cerebral ischemia, as possibly related 
to pemetrexed and cisplatin; though no such side effect was known for IMC-11F8 so far, a possible contributory 
role of IMC-11F8 cannot not be ruled out for both events. Update 26May10: Additional information was received
