Medically Significant
A neurologist reported that a  37 year old female patient on TYSABRI (unknown dose, unknown route, unknown 
frequency) for Multiple Sclerosis from unknown date to unknown date experienced PML (onset unknown).  The 
patient has received 68 infusions from 09 Oct 2007 to 16 Dec 2013 of TYSABRI for the indication of MS. The 
patient tested positive for JCV antibodies on an unknown date.  The patient is enrolled in(b) (6)   The patient has
received prior IS [immunosuppressive therapy] with Novantrone (Mitoxantrone). The patient experienced a MS 
onset in Jul 2001. Previous medication included on Copaxone (Glatiramer acetate). A MRI on 21 Dec 2013 was 
compared to 21 May 2013 and showed extensive white matter abnormality compatible with MS. A new confluent 
area of hyperintense T2  FLAIR signal abnormality noted in the right cerebellar hemisphere extending to right 
middle cerebellar peduncle without mass effect or restricted diffusion. A MRI on 17 Jan 2014 showed confluent T2 
hyperintense lesion within right brachium pontis and cerebellar hemisphere appears similar in size compared to 
prior Dec study and compatible with PML. Mild peripheral enhancement of the lesion is slightly decreased in 
prominence compared to prior exam. Multifocal T2 hyperintense lesions within the supratentorial and infratentorial 
white matter remains compatible with MS.  The patient is currently asymptomatic.  A lumbar puncture was done to 
evaluate the new MRI lesion on a routine surveillance MRI on an unknown date.  A (b) (6)  assay was 
positive for the qualitative test for JCV and  quantitative PCR had too few copies to measure. The patient was 
treated with PLEX and Neupogen (filgrastim) and was also prescribed mirtazapine.  The event of PML is ongoing. 
The causality for the event of PML is unknown.  It is unknown if TYSABRI treatment is ongoing.
Update 24 Jan 2014: The neurologist provided medical records that indicated that the patient was diagnosed with 
MS in 2000.  The patient has been on TYSABRI since 2007 and recently discovered a cerebellar lesion (b) (6)  
and tested positive for CSF JC virus DNA on an unknown date. The patient was admitted for plasma exchange, 
times three, and received Neupogen (Filgrastim) to enhance recovery of her immune system with a goal of 40 K/uL 
and was discharged with a WBC count of 52.70 K/uL (reference range 4.00 - 12.00).  The patient was found to be 
hypokalemic (onset unknown).  The patient received oral treatment and returned to normal limits.  Prior to 
discharge the patient was tachycardic (onset unknown).  The patient received IV fluid (NOS) boluses with 
improvement.  An EKG prior to discharge showed sinus tachycardia and TSH level was within normal limits at 1.6 
(reference range 0.4-4.7 ulU/mL).   Concomitant medications included mirtazapine 15mg tablet at bedtime, 
ascorbic acid 250mg tablet once daily, cholecalciferol 2000 unit capsule once daily, B complex vitamins 1 capsule 
daily, omega-3 fatty acids 1000mg capsule daily, ibuprofen 200mg every 6 hours as needed for pain, 
methylprednisolone sodium succinate, melatonin 1mg capsule at bedtime as needed,  diphenhydramine 25mg 
tablets every 6 hours as needed for sleeplessness, and tetrahydrozoline Zn sulfate 1 drop into affected eye three 
times daily as needed for itching.  The patient was discharged home.  The outcome of the event hypokalemic is 
resolved and the outcome of the event tachycardic is unknown.  Causality was not assessed. TYSABRI was 
discontinued.

FOIA Case Report Information
Update 28 Jan 2014: The neurologist reported that the Medical Director at (b) (6)  stated the initial [CSF JCV] 
sample was positive. A second sample was sent for quantitation and the result was previously reported. It was 
noted that there was no shortage of sample. The most recent MRI on 25 Jan [2014] shows no change. No further 
information was reported. 
Update 29 Jan 2014:  The neurologist reported that a second LP will be performed.  The LP scheduling will depend 
on changes in the patient as well as the MRI.  No further information was reported. 
Update 31 Jan 2014: The medical director from (b) (6)  provided the following informaton via email 
regarding CSF JCV PCR testing,. The JCV qualitative PCR resutls was detected; JCV standard quant PCR result 
was reported out at ?<500 copies/mL?. JCV was detected in the reaction used for the Quant result, but was below 
the lower limit of quantification (500 copies/mL).
Update 04 Feb 2014:  Upon internal review this case has been confirmed for PML.
Update 04 Feb 2014:  An infusion nurse at the patient's infusion site advised that patient has stopped TYSABRI due
to recent diagnoses of PML.
Update 10 Feb 2014: Additional information was received from a neurologist via a MS Standardized PML Data 
Collection Tool and diagnostic reports. An HIV test was performed on an unspecified date and was negative. The 
neurologist assessed the patient?s estimated Karnofsky scores as follows (dates unspecified): prior to starting 
TYSABRI to be 60 (requires occasional assistance, but is able to care for most of her personal needs); on 
TYSABRI prior to PML was 90 (able to carry on normal activity; minor signs or symptoms of disease); at time of 
PML diagnosis to be 90. The patient?s estimated EDSS scores were assessed as follows: on 16 Jul 2007 to be 1; 
on 28 Jan 2014 to be 1.5; on 06 Feb 2014 to be 2.5. The patient tested positive for anti-JCV antibody status on 08 
Jul 2011. A brain MRI was performed on 17 Jan 2014 (previously reported). Brain MRI performed on 25 Jan 2014 
was unchanged from the MRI dated 17 Jan 2014. On 03 Feb 2014, a brain MRI was done with results reported as 
follows: stable appearance of confluent hyperintense T2-weighted signal abnormalities identified within the right 
brachium pontis and cerebellar hemisphere similar in size as compared to the previous examination dated 25 Jan 
2014 consistent with PML given patient?s history. There is persistent, minimal peripheral enhancement. No 
additional areas of confluent signal abnormality to suggest additional sites of PML. Stable appearance of numerous 
hyperintense FLAIR signal abnormalities identified throughout the supratentorial and infratentorial white matter 
consistent with the patient?s history of MS. Findings are stable from the previous examination. There is no 
evidence to support active demyelination and no evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage, infarct or mass. 
Currently, the patient is alive and residing at home. She has not recovered from PML. Causality for the event was 
assessed as related to TYSABRI.

Update 25 Feb 2014:  The neurologist reported via a TOUCH discontinuation questionnaire that the patient has 
PML.  The patient tested positive on 24 Sep 2012 for anti-JCV antibodies.  No further information was reported.
Update 23 Apr 2014:  A healthcare provider in the neurologist's office reported that the patient was diagnosed with 
PML back in Jan 2014. The patient was treated with maraviroc and solumedrol and doing well. No additional 
information was reported.
Update 08 May 2014: In response to a request for follow-up information, the neurologist reported via the MSL that 
the patient is alive, residing at home, and is not currently on any MS therapy (plans to start TECFIDERA). The 
patient needs a walker to get around, but can help around the house and has a normal sleep-wake cycle. The 
neurologist reported she also received maraviroc as treatment for PML. The neurologist assessed the patient?s 
estimated EDSS score at six months post-PML diagnosis (date unspecified) to be 6.5. The patient?s most recent 
brain MRI (date unspecified) showed new enhancing lesions thought to be MS; they are contiguous with old MS 
lesions and not PML. The patient was diagnosed with IRIS, which was determined by clinical and radiological signs.
She had a brain stem lesion and the neurologist was concerned that the patient would stop breathing. She received
one round of IV Solumedrol 1g/day for three days. The outcome of the events of PML and IRIS and causality to 
TYSABRI were not provided.
Update 14 Jul 2014: The patient spontaneously reported that she was hospitalized from (b) (6)  to an 
unknown date for PML (onset (b) (6) ).  According to the patient, her prescribing physician confirmed the 
diagnosis of PML with two MRIs. The patient mentioned her handwriting has worsened (presumed residual 
symptom of PML).  The patient started TECFIDERA therapy on 12 Jun 2014 and continues on TECFIDERA 
therapy.  TYSABRI therapy was discontinued.
Update 04 Aug 2014:  The patient's husband spontaneously reported that the patient was diagnosed with PML on 
15 Jan 2014. The patient's last TYSABRI infusion was received on 16 Dec 2013. Testing included a spinal tap on 
26 Dec 2013 which came back negative/inconclusive, so a second spinal tap was performed on 06 Jan 2014 
(results not provided).   The patient was hospitalized from (b) (6)  to (b) (6)  for three plasma exchanges 
to flush out TYSABRI. After the plasma exchanges, the patient was diagnosed with IRIS and white blood cells were 
pumped into the body to fight these symptoms.  The patient's husband also reported that at some point after all of 
this (date unspecified), the patient lost most of her sight and was unable to walk (presumed residual symptoms of 
PML). Treatment included Solumedrol (methylprednisolone) for 3 days. The patient has since regained all of her 
vision and can walk again. However, her walking has become a lot slower. The patient is also experiencing fatigue 
and cognitive issues (presumed residual symptoms of PML). According to the patient's husband, the patient has 
been doing better than earlier in the year overall.  The patient's husband indicated that the patient received no MS 
treatments between last [TYSABRI] infusion on 16 Dec 2013 and the start of TECFIDERA on 09 Jun 2014.

FOIA Case Report Information
Update 05 Aug 2014: The neurologist re-reported via a TYSABRI Discontinuation questionnaire that the patient had
been diagnosed with PML since starting TYSABRI therapy.  The patient tested negative for the presence of anti-
JCV antibodies on an unknown date since 13 Oct 2013 (discrepant information; previously reported as tested 
positive).
Update 31 Dec 2014: Additional information was received from the neurologist via a MS Standardized PML Data 
Collection Tool. The patient is alive, residing at home, and is currently on TECFIDERA (dimethyl fumarate; started 
Jul 2014, date discrepant) for preventative MS therapy. The neurologist assessed the patient?s estimated 
Karnofsky score on 30 Dec 2014 to be 70 (cares for self; unable to carry on normal activity or to do active work). 
The patient?s EDSS score on 11 Dec 2014 was 2.5. A brain MRI was performed on 05 Dec 2014 with results 
reported as follows: lesion associated with PML is stable and does not enhance. Lesions thought to be associated 
with MS have improved except for one new lesion. As of 30 Dec 2014, the patient had recovered from PML and 
had recovered from IRIS. Causality for the event of PML was assessed as related to TYSABRI. Causality for the 
event of IRIS was assessed as unrelated to TYSABRI.
