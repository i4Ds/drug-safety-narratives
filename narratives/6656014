This non interventional post marketing study case (H3E-KL-B004, eudract number unknown), initially described in 
an article,concerns a 74-year old Asian male patient. The patient's medical history included malignant pleural 
mesothelioma. Concomitant medication included folic acid, dexamethasone and cyanocobalamin for prophylaxis. 
On 07-May-2007, the patient first received study drugs pemetrexed (Alimta) 500 mg/m2 at an unknown 
frequency/route and carboplatin AUC 5 at an unknown frequency/route for second line treatment of malignant 
pleural mesothelioma. On 07-May-2007, the patient received the last dose of the the study drugs prior to the event. 
On 10-May-2007, four days after the first/last dose of the study drugs, typical findings of tumour lysis syndrome 
developed in serum electrolytes and chemistry. The event of tumour lysis syndrome was reported to be life 
threatening. The event reached a peak on day seven with dramatic resolution in symptoms and chest x-ray. The 
specific laboratory parameters and results were not reported. Unexpected tumour lysis syndrome in the first cycle 
of chemotherapy was managed and overcome with supportive treatment. On an unknown date in May-2007, 
reportedly second day of the second chemotherapy cycle , the tumour lysis syndrome redeveloped, despite 
prophylactic hydration and urine alkalinisation. On an unknown date in May-2007, reportedly fifth day after second 
cycle, the patient developed pulmonary oedema and oliguria. The event of pulmonary edema was upgraded to 
serious for medically significant reasons by the company. Oliguria was considered non serious. Relevant 
investigations on 29-May-2007 included: brain natriuretic peptide 1967 pg/ml (normal range approximately 278). 
Relevant investigations on 31-May-2007 included: Blood urea nitrogen 35.5 mg/di (normal range 8-22), creatinine 
1.6 mg/dl (normal range 0.7-1.4), lactic cid dehydrogenase 1046 Ill& (normal ran e 263-450), uric acid 12.5 mg/dl 
(normal range 2.5-7.5) and phosphate 8.3 mg/dl (normal range 2.5-7.5). On the patient died due to 
cardiac arrest. A fatal outcome was reported for tumour lysis syndrome. It was unknown if the patient recovered 
from pulmonary oedema before death. It was unknown if autopsy was conducted. The study drugs were ongoing at 
the time of death. The investigator stated that pemetrexed and carboplatin might provoke potentially fatal tumour 
lysis syndrome in malignant mesothelioma. An opinion on the relatedness for cardiac arrest and pulmonary 
oedema was not provided. Relatedness to protocol procedures was not provided. This case was described in the 
article: Lee KY. Fatal tumour lysis syndrome in malignant pleural mesothelioma after pemetrexed/carboplatin 
chemotherapy. Journal of Thoracic Oncology 3(Suppl. 1) : S88 abstr. 244P, No 4, Apr 2008. Initial and follow up 
processed together on 29-May-2008. Upon medical review on 30-May-2008; the event of pulmonary oedema was 
upgraded to serious for other reasons 03-Jun-2008, edit made to the literature citation in the narrative. Update 07-
Aug-2008: As per the follow up received on 07-Aug-2008, no new information was received. However, an action 
item was set up for the affiliate to follow up with the authors for information on pemetrexed supplementation. 
Update 03-Mar-2009: Additional information received from the investigator on 25-Feb-2009. Changed the source to 
postmarketing study, added carboplatin as study drug, added patient demographics, supplementation, laboratory 
results, start dates, dosage and action taken for the study drugs, start date of the events and date of death. 
Updated the corresponding fields, narrative and PSUR comment with the same information.
