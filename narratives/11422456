A neurologist spontaneously reported that a 40 year old female patient on TYSABRI (300 mg, IV, QM) for relapsing 
remitting Multiple Sclerosis from 2011 to 10 Jul 2015 (discrepant information reported that duration of therapy was 
2 years) is currently hospitalized (dates unknown) for suspicion of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy 
(PML).  An MRI on 24 Feb 2015 showed a right juxtacortical frontal lesion consistent with PML, but was noted as 
not very suggestive of PML at that time.  Clinically, a left deficit appeared gradually since Feb 2015.  A "recent" MRI
in late Jul/ early Aug 2015 showed worsening of the right juxtacortical lesion that had spread out and a new right 
thalmic lesion (restriction in diffusion imaging) that was worsened compared to 24 Feb 2015 MRI and noted as 
highly suggestive of PML.  On an unknown date the patient tested positive for anti-JCV antibodies with an index 
value of 3.53.  On (b) (6)  the patient had a lumbar puncture (LP) and the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) tested 
negative for JCV DNA via PCR at (b) (6)  (lower limit of detection 11 copies/mL) and a local laboratory (lower limit

of detection unknown).  The patient had a second LP "a few days later"; at the time of this report, results were 
pending.  Treatment included plasma exchange (PLEX) (dates and number of sessions not reported).  The event of
suspect PML was ongoing.  The neurologist did not provide a causality assessment.  The status of TYSABRI 
therapy was not reported.

Update 24 Aug 2015:  The neurologist provided the following additional information via a MS Suspect PML Data 
Collection Form:  At the time of this report the patient was alive and residing the hospital.  At patient first developed 
signs of MS in Apr 1996 and was diagnosed with MS in Aug 2000.  MS symptoms included sensory/ multifocal 
symptoms (NOS) since Jun 2003 and motor/ multifocal symptoms since Apr 2011.  The patient was on TYSABRI 
from 02 May 2011 to 10 Jul 2015 and was discontinued due to suspicion of PML.  Since the discontinuation of 
TYSABRI the patient has not received any MS disease therapy.  The patient has never been enrolled in a Biogen 
sponsored or non-Biogen sponsored clinical trial.  The patient has not experienced an interruption of TYSABRI 
therapy for greater than 3 months.  Prior immunosuppressant/ immunomodulatory therapy included Copaxone 
(glatieramer acetate), and AVONEX.  PML suspicion was raised after the patient presented with clinical symptoms 
which prompted an MRI as well as findings on a routine MRI.  The neurology office systematically does an MRI 
every 6 months.  Signs and symptoms included motor/ multifocal symptoms of ataxia, weakness of the left arm, 
and a dystonic disorder of the left arm and eyelid since 02 Feb 2015.  An MRI prior to the suspicion of PML was 
done on 03 Mar 2015 (results not reported).  An MRI at the time of PML suspicion was done on (b) (6)
(results not reported).  A CSF sample from (b) (6)  was negative for JCV DNA.  Testing from (b) (6) , at 
the time of PML suspicion and prior to PLEX, included absolute leukocyte count of 10.3 G/L (reference range 4-10),
absolute lymphocyte count of 2.9 G/L (reference range 1-4), CD4 count of 1.028 G/L (reference range 0.7-1.1), 
CD8 count of 0.77G/L (reference range 0.5-0.9), CD4/CD8 ratio of 1.3, CD3+ of 1.9 G/L (reference range 1.1-1.7), 
CD19 of 0.647 G/L (reference range 0.2-0.4), and a %CD62L of 60%.  A CSF sample from (b) (6)  was 
positive for JCV DNA at 11 copies/mL ((b) (6) ).  Analysis of the CSF from (b) (6)  showed a sterile culture 
with less than 1 cell, a glucose of 6mmol/L, and proteins of 0.32g/L (no reference ranges provided).  No brain 
biopsy was performed.  The patient tested positive for anti-JCV antibodies on (b) (6)  with an index value of 
3.53.  Treatment for the event included mirtazapine, corticosteroids (NOS) for IRIS suspicion, and plasmapheresis 
for 5 sessions on (b) (b) (b) (b)(6) , (6)  (6)  (6)  and 
(b) (6)   The neurologist considered the patient to be still under 
investigation for PML.

(reference:  BX20150945).  MS symptoms since 1997, diagnosed with relapsing remitting MS in 2000, 8 MS 
relapse since 2000. Long-term treatment by Copaxone from 2003 to 2004 and Avonex from 2004 to 2007 and 
finally Tysabri since 2011 (56 infusions). In Feb2015, occurrence of episodes of abnormal movements of the left 
arm. MRI showed a new right temporal lesion, cortical and linear in Flair, thought to be MS lesion. Tysabri was 
subsequently continued and the lesion not retested.  On (b) (6)  The patient was awakened by left arm clonus 
that spontaneously resolved then that resumed around 7am with extension to the face. The crisis took place in 3 
phases: started with the shoulder with dystonia and then spread in the arm, follows a clonic phase with complete 
weakness of the left arm and finally occurrence of a hemifacial left clonus.  On (b) (6)  the patient is 
hospitalized, she presented with myoclonic movements of the left arm in all its segments, not rhythmic, as well as of
the left eyebrow. Despite distractibility maneuvers, little change in symptoms. Intermittent motor weakness of the 
left arm in all its segments and ataxia poorly characterized in that limb, cerebellar like.  On (b) (6)
benzodiazepine Therapeutic Test (diazepam 10 mg) showed frank decrease of myoclonus but, to a lesser extent, 
persistence of myoclonus of the left eyebrow, existing despite voluntary contraction, which was in favor of organic 
disorder.  On (b) (6)  diazepam switched to 15 mg of mirtazapine. No recurrence of clonic movement of the 
left arm. 1 episode of paresthesia in the left upper limb (less than 10 min) witnessed by the nurse but not the 
resident. No other neurological manifestation.  On (b) (6)  recurrence of 1 episode of abnormal movements at 
home, spontaneously regressive and isolated.  Introduction of 500 mg levetiracetam bid.  On (b) (6)
According to the neuro-radiologist, very evocative image of PML despite negative JC virus testing in cerebrospinal 
fluid (sensitivity of 70% therefore not absolute). Corticosteroids subsequently discontinued and plasma exchange 
continued.  Biology:  JC virus serology in blood: positive (index: 3.53; > 1).  Lumbar puncture ((b) (6) ): CSF 
protein, CSF glucose and CSF lactate were normal.  HSV and VZV PCR negative and JC virus PCR in CSF 
negative.  CMV, EBV, HHV6 PCR in CSF negative.  Syphilis in serum and CSF negative.  BK PCR in blood and 
urine negative.  Cryptococcus test negative.  CD4+ CD62L lymphocytes count: 60% (PML risk factor).  Additional 
tests:  Clinical examination: no sensorimotor deficit, afebrile, no urinary functional symptoms, no recent infection.
EEG performed on (b) (6)  and (b) (6)  normal.  MRI of (b) (6)  found lesion seen on Feb2015 that 
has increased and rather suggestive of PML ("milky way" morphology). Presence of a new nonspecific right 
thalamic lesion. Stability of other lesions of the semi-oval center and periventricular in connection with old MS 
lesions.  Brain MRI (post plasma-exchange) of (b) (6)  lesion stable, doubt regarding linear contrast 
enhancement bordering the prefrontal fissure. Very little argument for contrast enhancement linked solely to PML.
Brain MRI on (b) (6)  No contrast enhancement, no argument for an immune reconstitution inflammatory 
syndrome.  Corrective treatment:  On (b) (6)  1 vial Rivotril (clonazepam) and levetiracetam 500 mg twice a 
day (stopped on(b) (6)  and resumed on (b) (6) ).  From (b) (6)  to (b) (6)  diazepam 10 mg.  On
05Aug2015: plasma exchange due to high suspicion of PML ((b) (6) , (b) (6)  (b) (6)  (b) (6)  (b) (6) ) and as of 
(b) (6)  mirtazapine 15 mg.  Evolution:  On (b) (6)  No recurrence of abnormal movements.
On (b) (6)  presence of JC virus in CSF confirmed PML

Update 28 Aug 2015:  The neurologist provided the following additional information.  ON (b) (6)  the patient 
experienced a left brachio-facial partial seizure, 20 minutes in duration.  The clinical condition of the patient was 
reported as stable, but it was noted that "an important post critical deficit occurred that has not yet been 
reassessed".

Update 01 Sep 2015:  Biogen considers this case to be confirmed for PML based on positive CSF, consistent 
radiological findings, and clinical symptoms.
Update 14 Sep 2015:  The reporting neurologist provided the following additional information.  An MRI performed in
Feb 2015 (presumed in reference to previously reported MRI from 24 Feb 2015) revealed a cortical lesion that 
"didn't really look like a MS lesion", however was compatible to the patient's symptoms of partial left upper limb 
paresis.  The patient was treated with a bolus of corticosteroids (NOS) for the MS relapse.  In Jun 2015 there was 
neither an improvement nor a clear worsening.
