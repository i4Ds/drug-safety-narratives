AER1281825 is a non-interventional study literature case, received on 26/Sep/2013 from a physician via health 
authority, Health Canada (Canada/473826) and concerns a patient of unspecified demographics who developed 
progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), while being enrolled in a retrospective study aimed  to evaluate 
the long-term event-free (EFS) and overall (OS) survival rates following ASCT for Follicular Lymphoma (FL), and to 
identify predictors of improved outcome and to evaluate the potential impact of rituximab use and clinical prognostic
factors on these outcomes. 
A retrospective analysis of the first 100 consecutive patients with relapsed or refractory FL treated with high dose 
chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplant (HDT/ASCT) in Calgary from 1993 to 2008 was conducted.  The
Calgary ASCT database was interrogated to identify the initial consecutive 100 patients receiving HDT/ASCT for 
relapsed or refractory FL.  Rituximab became available in the healthcare region in 2000 for relapsed FL, in 2004 for
use in combination with up-front FL chemotherapy and in 2007 for maintenance therapy after induction 
chemotherapy but not after ASCT.  The use of rituximab with re-induction chemotherapy or with stem cell 
mobilization chemotherapy was recorded as rituximab less than 6 months prior to ASCT.  Th e first consecutive 
100 patients (59 males, age range: 30-71 years) were treated with HDT/ASCT for relapsed/refractory FL in Calgary 
between September 1993 and October 2008.  Thirty patients failed rituximab-based chemotherapy prior to ASCT, 
including 22 relapsed and eight refractory patients.  No patient received maintenance rituximab post-ASCT.
Patient's concomitant medications included carboplatin, cisplatin, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin hydrochloride, 
etoposide, ifosfamide, vincristine sulfate and granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF).
On an unspecified date, the patient started intravenous rituximab solution, ibritumomab tiuxetan, prednisone, 
intravenous fludarabine phosphate at 250 mg/me2 and busulfan 12 mg/kg. Subsequently, the patient developed life
threatening progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy.
The reporter assessed the causality of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy as related to rituximab, 
fludarabine phosphate and busulfan along with underlying disease of lymphoma and unrelated to ibritumomab 
tiuxetan and prednisone.
The health authority assessed the event of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy as medically significant.

Additional information was received on 02/Sep/2014 and  the following information was added to the case: The 
merger of the duplicate AER1281856 was done in this case: The licensee Genzyme received report on 14 Sep 
2012, forwarded to Bayer on 23 Oct 12 (MFR.1001580) and received to Roche on 02 Sep 2014: The causality was 
updated for PML also related to underlying disease of lymphoma and unrelated to prednisone. The concomitant as 
filgrastim was added.
