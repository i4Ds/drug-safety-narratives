In a multicenter phase II trial, Gallamini et al combined low-dose alemtuzumab (10 mg) with four-weekly CHOP for 
newly diagnosed Peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL). "Twenty-four consecutive patient's were enrolled. Histology 
was confirmed in only 19 patients: PTCL-NOS (n=8), angioimmunoblastic T-celllymphoma (AITlL) (n=7), alk-
negative anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) (n=3), and enteropathy-type (n=l ). After preliminary safety was 
demonstrated in the first 4 patients, the next 20 patients received 8 cycles of CHOP-28 with alemtuzumab at 10 mg 
intravenously on day-1 of each course. CRs were seen in 17 of 24 (71 %) patients. This report contains an male 
patient of unspecified age. The patient's weight and height were not reported. The patient's concurrent condition 
included peripheral t-cell lymphoma unspecified. The patient was treated with doxorubicin hydrochloride 
(unspecified, unknown) initiated on an unspecified date for peripheral t cell lymphoma. Non-company suspect drugs
included: cyclophosphamide (unspecified, unknown), vincristine (unspecified, unknown), alemtuzumab 
(unspecified, unknown) and prednisone (unspecified, unknown) all drug initiated on unspecified, dose and 
frequency for peripheral t cell lymphoma. Concomitant medications were not reported. On an unspecified date, the 
patient experienced reactivation of jc virus. Action taken with doxorubicin hydrochloride, prednisone, vincristine, 
alemtuzumab and cyclophosphamide was not provided. The outcome was not reported for reactivation of jc virus. 
At a median follow-up of 16 months, 13 of the 24 patients (54%) were disease-free with an estimated 2-year overall
survival (OS) and failure-free survival of 53% and 48% respectively.
This report was serious (medically significant).
