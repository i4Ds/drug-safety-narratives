progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy.  American Journal of Neuroradiology; 27 Aug 2015.  doi: 
10.3174/ajnr.A4436.  This case is in reference to patient number 10, a 46 year old male patient with a total of 29 
months of TYSABRI (dose, route, frequency unknown) exposure.  The patient was on TYSABRI therapy from an 
unknown date to an unknown date for relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS).  The patient's cerebrospinal 
fluid (CSF) was negative for JCV DNA.  A total of 5 brain MRIs were available, from "pre-symptomatic to chronic 
stage" (dates and results not reported).  The patient had susceptibility weighted imaging (SWI) and T2 weighted 
MRIs.  The location of PML lesions was right frontal and left frontal, the PML was not adjacent to basal ganglia, 
there was low signal intensity within U-fibers, there was no low signal deep GM.  At the time of detection of the 
susceptibility-weighted signal abnormality the patient was described as in the chronic stage.  The authors stated

that they considered the patient to be diagnosed with PML based on highly suggestive imaging and clinical follow-
up in the setting of negative CSF.  The authors assessed causality as related.  The status of TYSABRI therapy was 
not reported.
