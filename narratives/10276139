FOIA Case Report Information
This case concerns an 82 year old male patient developed left sided weakness (unspecified) and died because of 
progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy secondary to John Cunningham (JC) virus while receiving treatment 
with alemtuzumab (Campath) and rituximab.
No relevant medical history, past drugs, concomitant medications and concurrent conditions were reported.
On an unknown date, the patient was enrolled in protocol number (b) (6)  and was randomized to Arm A 
(alemtuzuman and rituximab). On 25-Feb-2012, the patient initiated first course of subcutaneous alemtuzumab, 
solution for infusion, with dose (escalated) of 03 mg on day 1, 10 mg on day 2 and 30 mg on day 3 of cycle 1 and at
an unspecified dose on days 6, 8,10,13,15,17, 20, 22, 24, 27, 29, 31 of cycle 1 and intravenous rituximab (MoAb 
C2B8 anti CD20, chimeric) at a dose of 375 mg/m2, on days 8, 15, 22, 29 of cycle 1, (batch/lot number and 
expiration date: unknown for both) both for chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. On an unspecified date, in 2012, she 
started receiving second cycle of alemtuzumab at an unknown dose on days 1, 3, 5, 8, 10, 13, 15, 17, 19, 22, 24 
and 26 and rituximab at a dose of 375 mg/m2 on days 3, 10, 17, 24 of cycle 2. On 02-Apr-2014, the patient 
received treatment with alemtuzumab (course associated with the event). On 27-Apr-2012, treatment with rituximab
and alemtuzumab was completed. It was reported that the patient received a total of 360 mg alemtuzumab and 
2040 mg rituximab. On 02-Jul-2012, the patient presented to the emergency room with "left-sided weakness". A 
head computed tomography (CT) scan was performed and the results showed concern for possible lymphoma or 
metastatic disease and the patient was admitted to the hospital. On an unspecified date, in JUL-2012, her head 
MRI and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis was performed and the patient was diagnosed with grade 5 progressive
multifocal leukoencephalopathy secondary to JC virus. The patient was provided with the findings and elected to be
discharged with no treatment (at the time of this report) and the patient will follow up with their primary physician. It 
was reported that the patient did not receive a third cycle due to complete response and was in observation at the 
time of this report. On (b) (6)  (b) (6)  days after initiating treatment, the patient died due to progressive 
multifocal leukoencephalopathy secondary to JC virus in hospice. No autopsy was performed. 
Corrective treatment: not reported for left sided weakness (unspecified); none for Progressive multifocal 
leukoencephalopathy secondary to JC virus
Outcome: Unknown for the event of left sided weakness (unspecified) 
Reporter's causality: associate for both events (one patient in this study died from pml, which could be attributed to 
therapy-induced immunosuppression)
Company causality: associated with both drugs for both events
