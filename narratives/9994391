Medically Significant
A professor of neurology reported via a sales representative that an adult male patient of unknown age on 
TYSABRI infusions (natalizumab, unknown dose, unknown route, unknown frequency, unknown therapy start date) 
for Multiple Sclerosis (MS) had restarted TYSABRI therapy 2012 after a drug holiday and was hospitalized at the 
time of this report for progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML; onset unknown). Diagnostic investigations 
and treatment were not specified. The event of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy was ongoing. Besides 
MS, patient's medical history included an MS relapse in 2012 (refer to Mfr report DE-BIOGENIDEC-2013BI119507).
Concomitant medication was not provided. The causality for the event of progressive multifocal 
leukoencephalopathy was assessed as related. It is unknown if TYSABRI treatment is ongoing.
Update 06 Mar 2014 : Additional information received from a professor (presume health professional) reported that 
the patient received TYSABRI (300 mg every 4 weeks) from 2010 to 17 Oct 2013. A final decision on [TYSABRI] 
discontinuation was made on 13 Nov 2013 and the total number of TYSABRI infusions unknown.
The patient had been known to have MS since 1989 with relapsing progressive course.  Prior MS medications 
comprised of interferons (NOS), Copaxone (glatiramer acetate), mitoxantrone, and one single dose of 
cyclophosphamide and since 2010 TYSABRI. Suspicion of transformation to secondary chronic progressive MS 
was also reported.
Concomitant medications consisted of baclofen (25 mg, half a tablet 3 times a day per mouth) for tetraspasticism; 
Fampyra (Fampridine) (10mg, BID, per mouth) for hemiataxia left; Spasmex (trospium) (15 mg, BID, per mouth) for
urinary incontinence; Paroxetin (30mg, QD, per mouth) for depression. The concomitant medications were reported
to be ongoing.
The onset date of PML was not reported, however, the patient was hospitalized for PML from (b) (6)  to (b)(6)  
(b) (6)  The physician additionally considered the event to have caused permanent disability. Clinical signs and 
symptoms of PML included worsening of tetraspasticism and tetraparesis; hemiataxia left, ageusia, 
hemihypaesthesia on the left side, urinary and stool incontinence despite intensive therapy with plasmapheresis 
and cortisone pulse. A JCV PCR of cerebrospinal fluid was performed at local lab (university hospital) on (b) (6)  
(b) (6)  and it was slightly positive with less than 250 copies/mL. On (b) (6)  another JCV-PCR in CSF was done
at the (b) (6)  with a questionable result. In consultation with the 
virologist at the(b) (6)  it was decided to test for JCV antibodies at the 
(b) (6)  The results were as follows: On (b) (6)  JCV-antibodies in
CSF were 7500 AU and  JCV antibodies in serum were 36000 AU. On 02 Dec 2013, JCV ASI (anti-JC virus 
antibody index in CSF for diagnosis of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy) was 35.9 (upper limit of normal 
1.5). MRI was done on 06 Nov 2013 and showed marked progression of lesions in the internal capsule on the right 
and in midbrain with contrast enhancement. The reporting professor stated that he has no information on the

further course.
Update 14 Mar 2014 : Additional information was received from the HCP who reported that the JCV PCR testing 
performed at the local lab on (b) (6)  which was slightly positive at less than 250 copies/mL and had a 
reference range of negative. The reason for the second LP performed on (b) (6)  was to verify the finding at 
the local lab and to underpin the diagnosis of PML with determination of ASI-JCV.  The only information regarding 
the results from the (b) (6)  test was "questionable". The reporting HCP indicated that he is not the primary 
provider for the patient and hence, no follow-up information was available.
Update 03 Apr 2014: Biogen Idec considers this case to be high suspect for PML (final call).
Update 19 May 2014: A neurologist reported via email that the patient had been diagnosed with PML with delay and
only by a JCV-antibody test performed in(b) (6) . The patient had been known to be JCV-antibody positive 
since 11 Jun 2013. The test was organized via a local lab which most likely did not perform the test itself. It is 
unknown to the reporting neurologist which lab actually performed that test.  First dose of TYSABRI was 
administered on 02 May 2011 (date discrepant). TYSABRI had been administered every 5 weeks (unapproved 
dosing interval) (onset unknown). The patient has received a total of 25 doses of TYSABRI. At the start of 
TYSABRI therapy (presume 2010), EDSS was 6.5 (needed walking aids, could walk 20-30 minutes without a 
break). At time of onset of PML (Jul 2013), EDSS was 6.5; at time when PML was finally diagnosed ((b) (6) ), 
EDSS was 7.0, and at present EDSS is 7.0.  At present, the patient lives at home with her husband. She has 
severe spastic hemiparesis of the left body half; she is wheelchair bound and her mood is depressed.
On 21 May 2014, a letter sent by the neurologist was received containing medical documents. Report of a cMRI 
dated 13 May 2013 (routine control in MS) compared to previous scans from Nov 2012 showed a new small lesion 
in thalamus on the right.  All other lesions (spotty signal alterations periventricular in the white matter frontal, 
parietal and occipital) were unchanged in number and size. There was no acute MS lesion, no disturbance of 
diffusion, no hint for PML, no alterations of vessels, and no disturbance of circulation of the cerebrospinal fluid.
Report of a cMRI dated 23 Aug 2013 (when the patient had worsening complaints of tetra-spasticity more 
pronounce in legs and more on the left not responsive to cortisone treatment) compared to previous scans from 13 
May 2013 showed an increase in size of the demyelization lesion in the right thalamus. There were multiple partially
confluent demyelization lesions periventricular in the white matter on both sides and also sporadically in the 
subcortical and infratentorial areas. MRI-wise, there were no clear signs of new lesions, no disruption of blood brain
barrier, and no sign for PML.
A discharge summary regarding a hospitalization from (b) (6)  to (b) (6)  indicated that on admission,

the patient was alert, fully oriented with no meningismus, no aphasia, no dysarthria, and was  Lhermitte's sign 
positive. The patient's final diagnosis was reported as MS with relapsing-progressing course with signs and 
symptoms of spastic tetraparesis more pronounced in legs and on the left, left hemihypesthesia, left hemiataxia, 
neurogenic bladder voiding disorder, which had already been treated with 2 courses of cortisone pulse therapy in 
Aug 2013 (first pulse 5x1000mg cortisone, second pulse 3x2000mg cortisone). 
The patient's medical history included arthrodesis of left hip joint due to dysplasia in 1983, removal of 
osteosynthesis material in 1988, and radio frequency ablation of facet joints L4/L5 and L5/S1 on 19 Dec 2011 due 
to severe left-pronounced lumbar-ischiadic pain. Progressive MS was diagnosed in 1989 with three monthly 
relapses. Neurogenic bladder voidance disorder was diagnosed in 1998 when a suprapubic catheter was inserted.
The patient has experienced recurrent urinary tract infections as a result. 
Previous MS therapies included interferons (NOS), Copaxone (glatiramer), azathioprine, and immunoglobulins 
(NOS).  In 2002, the patient was switched from glatiramer acetate to mitoxantrone due to impaired walking.  The 
patient was on mitoxantrone until Oct 2005 at a total dose of 70mg/m2 body surface, which was well tolerated.
From 2006 - 2011, the patient took Rebif (interferon beta-1a) again. Due to further progression, the patient was 
switched to TYSABRI in early 2011 (discrepant information as to when TYSABRI was started, it was also reported 
that TYSABRI was started in 2010).  Fampyra (fampridine) was commenced in 2011, which improved her walking 
ability. In Sep 2012 (after rehabilitation) the patient had been able to walk 185m with 2 underarm crutches. Since 
beginning of 2013, the patient noticed worsening of left-pronounced tetraparesis and spasticity and since Aug 2013,
the patient presented with marked worsening of left pronounced tetraparesis, leg spasticity, hemiataxia and sensory
disorders, which had already been treated with 2 courses of cortisone pulse therapy in Aug 2013 (first pulse 
5x1000mg cortisone, second pulse 3x2000mg cortisone). Due to significant worsening of symptoms and 
unsuccessful cortisone therapy, plasmapheresis was started. The patient received 5 cycles of plasmapheresis 
without improvement of symptoms. Due to spasticity, baclofen dose was increased and Sirdalud (tizanidine) was 
added. However, severe spasticity persisted. Baclofen was then administered intrathecally on 11 Sep 2013 with 
significant improvement of leg spasticity and insertion of a baclofen pump was recommended.
Liquor diagnostic on 02 Sep 2013 showed oligoclonal bands, signs of intrathecal synthesis of immunoglobulins, and
normal cell counts. JCV PCR test in CSF was performed twice: at the local lab with the result reported as 
inconclusive/questionable positive and retest at (b) (6)  was negative. Serology for Borrelia was negative.
On (b) (6)  the patient was transferred to rehabilitation center. Medication at time included: paroxetin, Exinef 
(etoricoxib), Spasmex (trospium), Siralud (tizanidine), baclofen, Fampyra (fampridine), Nitroxolin forte (nitroxoline), 
mirtazapine, pantoprazole, and Movicol (polyethylene glycol).  Discharge summary of stay at rehabilitation center 
from (b) (6)  to 13 Nov 2013 and from 26 Nov 2013 to 24 Jan 2014 was provided. Since Oct 2013, the patient

experienced worsening of hemihypesthesia on the left, mild dysarthrophonia and mild dysphagia, ageusia on the 
left, and stool incontinence. The patient received cortisone pulse therapy in Oct 2013 followed by one dose of 
TYSABRI on 18 Oct 2013. The patient also received fondaparinux and pantoprazole.  The patient had a 
neurological re-evaluation at university hospital on 13 Nov 2013 and on 26 Nov 2013. At the university hospital, the 
patient received 4 cycles of plasmapheresis followed by one cycle of cyclophosphamide (400 mg/m2 body surface) 
on 25 Nov 2013. PML was diagnosed in Dec 2013 and treated with mefloquine and mirtazapine. On (b) (6)
the patient had severe depression and attempted suicide where she cut her wrist with a scalpel and needed 
surgical intervention.  In Jan 2014, the patient started experiencing tonic brain stem seizures/myoclonic convulsions
of the left arm. The patient was suspected for IRIS in Jan 2014 and therefore received cortisone pulse therapy with 
1000 mg methylprednisolone for 5 days in Jan 2014.  The patient's weight is 83 kg and height is 174 cm. The 
patient's EDSS was 8.0 on admission to the rehabilitation center and at discharge.
cMRI native and with contrast medium on 11 Oct 2013 was compared to previous scans from 23 Aug 2013 which 
showed an increase in size of a lesion in the right internal capsule with unclear weak contrast enhancement at the 
rim. cMRI native on 06 Nov 2013 showed worsening of findings. There was marked increase in size of the lesion in 
the internal capsule on the right cranial reaching the thalamus and caudal reaching the mesencephalon (midbrain). 
In addition there was a lesion in the midbrain on the left which had been relatively small and has now significantly 
increased in size. cMRI native and with contrast medium on 02 Jan 2014 showed the lesion in right thalamus has 
further increased in size, same was true for the smaller lesion in the left thalamus. Additionally, there was 
progression respectively in the new contrast enhancing ribbon-like subcortical lesions in the right cerebral 
hemisphere.
From (b) (6)  - (b) (6)  the patient was again hospitalized at the university hospital and then transferred 
back to the rehab center. Because of depression and anxiety disorder the patient was treated with lorazepam and 
mirtazapine. Furthermore, the patient was treated with paroxetine. Myoclonal convulsions of the left arm occurred in
Jan 2014 and were treated with carbamazepine or levetiracetam which was not tolerated by the patient. On 24 Jan 
2014, patient was discharged home from rehabilitation center. Medication at time of discharge included paroxetine, 
trospium chloride, baclofen, Nitroxolin forte (nitroxoline), mirtazapine, methionine, pregabalin, mefloquine, 
pantoprazole, Macrogol (polyethylene glycol), potassium, lorazepam, and fondaparinux.
Update 21 May 2014: A report was received via the literature: Warnke C, von Geldern G, Markwerth P, et al. The 
CSF JCV antibody index for diagnosis of natalizumab-associated PML, Potential implications for PML case 
definition. Annals of Neurology. 2014; Volume 00: doi:10.1002/ana.24153.   Upon internal review, it was noted that 
the literature article was erroneously applied to case 2009BI033570, but it is in fact follow up to this case. The 
author reported that the patient (identified as case 17) was categorised in the qPCR<100 copies/ml AI (antibody 
index) >1.5 group. Results of two CSF JCV DNA PCR tests performed at a local Virology laboratory were

indeterminate positive. CSF JCV antibody Index (AI JCV) of 35.90. The author noted that a delayed diagnosis of 
PML was based on clinical and MRI changes, two indeterminate positive JCV-DNA PCR results from a local 
Virology laboratory (despite repetitive negative local JCV-DNA PCR results) and ''evidence for pronounced 
intrathecal anti-JCV antibody synthesis from our study''. As the clinical deterioration was initially judged as new MS 
disease activity   influenced by the inconclusive PCR results and MS-like imaging appearance of the lesion - PLEX 
as escalation treatment for relapse, and one additional infusion of TYSABRI-therapy was given in this case prior to 
diagnosis of PML. The author concluded that determination of the AI JCV could be an added tool in the diagnostic 
workup for PML and should be included in the case definition of natalizumab associated PML. No outcome or 
causality was reported. No additional information was provided.
Update 28 May 2014: Upon follow-up, it was clarified that this case involves a female patient (previously reported 
as male patient).
Update 29 May 2014: Upon internal review, this case is confirmed for PML based on the positive CSF and MRI 
finding.
Update 02 Oct 2014: Additional information was received from the neurologist via a MS Standardized PML Data 
Collection Tool. The patient is alive, residing at home, and is not currently on any MS therapy. The neurologist 
assessed the patient s estimated Karnofsky score on 23 Sep 2014 to be 50 (requires considerable assistance and 
frequent medical care). EDSS was assessed on 22 Aug 2014 as 8.0. A brain MRI was performed on 19 Jun 2014 
with results reported as follows: Follow-up brain MRI native (no contrast medium administration possible due to 
poor venous access) performed on 18 Jun 2014 revealed numerous partly confluent demyelinating lesions in 
periventricular white matter on both sides, some lesions were also subcortical and infratentorial. Compared with 
previous examination from Aug 2013, there was a significant increase of diffuse signal enhancement in thalamus 
on the right side reaching up to subcortical region with focal cortical atrophy and reaching up to midbrain and brain 
stem region caudally. The findings are rather consistent with progredient diffuse encephalitic disease picture (PML 
questionable) as with progress of MS. Lesion load of MS was similar compared with previous examination from Aug
2013. No hydrocephalus, no hygroma, no brain edema, no subdural hematoma. The patient has not been 
diagnosed with IRIS. The patient has not recovered from PML. Causality for the event was assessed as related to 
TYSABRI.
Update 23 Dec 2014: Additional information was received from the neurologist via a MS Standardized PML Data 
Collection Tool. The patient is alive, residing at home, and is not currently on any MS therapy. The neurologist 
assessed the patient s estimated Karnofsky and EDSS scores on 03 Nov 2014 to be 50 (requires considerable 
assistance and frequent medical care) and 8.0. A brain MRI was performed on 18 Aug 2014 with results reported 
as follows: findings consistent rather with progredient diffuse encephalitic disease pattern (PML?) than with

progress of MS. The patient has not recovered from PML and has not recovered from IRIS. Causality for the events
of PML and IRIS was assessed as related to TYSABRI.
Update 02 Jul 2015: The female patient on TYSABRI for MS spontaneously reported experiencing and surviving 
PML. The patient has had completely no feeling of her left side any longer and had severe pain.  Additionally, the 
patient had been dependent to her wheel chair since 2013.
