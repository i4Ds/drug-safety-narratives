This case was reported by a lawyer and described the occurrence of congenital 
anomaly in a male neonate who was exposed in utero to Paroxetine 
hydrochloride (Paxil) during unknown trimester(s). The patient's mother was 
receiving Paroxetine hydrochloride for an unknown drug indication. A 
physician or other health care professional has not verified this report. 
aAccording to the legal complaint, the patient's mother received Paroxetine lichloride to which the patient was exposed via placenta. 04111111.1. the mother gave birth to.a neonate who was born with ''congenital birth 
defects, heart defects, PPHN [persistent pulmonary hypertension of the 
neonate], and/or other related conditions or... various pulmonary disorders". 
The complaint further alleged that the events were life-threatening, and that 
the patient "suffers from physical injuries, the full extent of which have 
not yet been determined, some or all of which are permanent and/or fatal" It 
was also alleged that the patient sustained or would sustain "pain and 
suffering, mental anguish, embarrassment or humiliation, disfigurement and 
the loss of enjoyment of the pleasures of life without the presence of 
congenital birth defects, heart defects, PPHN, and/or other related 
conditions". At the time of reporting, the outcome of the events was unknown.

Follow up information was received on 23 January 2008 via supplemental fact 
sheets completed by the patient's parent(s) and the reporting attorney. The 
mother began receiving Paxil CR 12.5 mg daily in October 2004 for treatment 
of anxiety. The dose was increased to Paxil CR 25 mg once daily from January 
2005 to March 2005. In March 2005, she was switched to Paroxetine 
hydrochloride 10 mg once daily, which was discontinued in May 2005. The 
mother received Zofran from approximately 01 March 2005 to 11 March 2005 for

Follow up information was received on 15 May 2008 via medical records. The 
patient was hospitalized on 11.1111111.111.11.after presenting with severe 
respiratory distress and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) pneumonia. The 
patient underwent multiple diagnostic tests including chest and abdominal 
x-rays for indications of smoke inhalation and respiratory distress, with 
findings during the course of hospitalization including pneurnatosis 
intestines/ pneumatosis tali, hepatic/ pelvic ascites, mildly echogenic 
kidneys bilaterally, pulmonary vascular abnormalities including congestion 
bilaterally, cardiomegaly, atelectasis, pulmonary interstitial thickening 
consistent with allergic/inflammatory etiology, and results "suggestive" of 
left to right cardiac shunt. 041111111.1111...echocardiogram results 
included patent foramen ovale (PFO) with restrictive left to right shunting, 
dilated and hypertrophied right ventricle, a large conoventricular type 
ventricular septal defect (VSD) with bidirectional shunting, mild posterior 
and leftward deviation of the canal septum, dilated left ventricle with 
"fairly good" systolic function, mild transverse arch hypoplasia, interrupted 
aortic arch, small patent ductus arteriosus with bidirectional shunting, 
small atrial septal defect with left to right flow, and likely severe aortic 
coarctation. A follow up echocardiogram on 06 January 2006, status post PDA 
stenting, showed an interrupted aortic arch, right ventricular and septal 
hypertrophy, and a D-shaped left ventricle. Subsequent echocardiograms 
continued to show interrupted aortic arch, VSD, dilated and hypertrophied 
right ventricle, ASD/ PFO, pulmonary regurgitation, inferior vena cava clot, 
left ventricular hypertrophy, and bidirectional flow across stented PDA. On 
10 February 2006, cytogenetics study demonstrated a normal male karyotype, 
and fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis ruled, out deletion of 
22q11.2. Additionally, an abdominal ultrasound on 16 March 2006 showed an 
echogenic non-obstructive thrombus in the intrahepatic inferior vena cava 
proximal to the take-off of the renal veins, which were bilaterally patent. 
Following palliation by placement of the expandable stent in the ductus 
arteriosus, he developed evidence of increasing diastolic reversal of flow 
over time as well as some problems with mesenteric ischemia. Hospitalization

while the patient was in the cardiac care unit, showed an interrupted aortic 
arch status post stent in the PDA, biventricular hypertrophy With 
qualitatively good ventricular wail motion, interatrial communication, 
bidirectional flow across the stented FDA, moderate concentric left 
ventricular hypertrophy, and a restrictive conoventricular VSD. On 16 March 
2006 echocardiography showed PFO, inferior versa cave clot, dilated right 
atrium and right ventricle, 6 mm VSD, elevated right ventricular systolic 
pressure, hypertrophied left ventricle, mild flow acceleration across aortic 
valve, mild-plus pulmonary regurgitation, and dilated main pulmonary artery. 
Echocardiogram findings on 06 April 2006 included moderate biventricular 
hypertrophy with normal ventricular function, septal flattening consistent 
with elevated right ventricular pressure, and no residual ASD or VSD seen. 
The patient was seen for cardiology follow up on 12 June 2006, at which time 
an electrocardiogram demonstrated right ventricular hypertrophy. Examination 
revealed a grade 2 to 3/6 systolic murmur, and he was receiving no 
medications. He was assessed to be doing well without any cardiac 
symptomology, and subacute bacterial endocarditis (SBE) prophylaxis was 
recommended. He was again evaluated on 20 September 2006, and an 
echocardiogram on that date showed mild biventricular hypertrophy, no 
evidence of septa( flattening consistent with normal right ventricular 
pressure, no residual ASD, and no residual VSD. He continued to do well 
without cardiac symptomology, and on 21 March 2007 echocardiography showed a

Follow up information was received on 05 May 2009 via medical records. 
Pharmacy records showed that Paxil CR 25 mg tablets were dispensed to the 
mother on 10 February 2005, and generic Paroxetine hydrochloride 10 mg 
tablets on 31 March 2005. In March 2005, an ultrasound showed a complex cyst 
on the mother's right adnexa as well as definite intrauterine pregnancy. She 
was receiving Zofran. She was followed during pregnancy for anxiety disorder. 
Upon admission for induction of labor, the mother admitted to tobacco use and 
drinking wine approximately monthly. The patient was born via spontaneous 
vaginal delivery. The patient presented for cardiology evaluation on 29 
September 2008, and was receiving no cardiac medications at that time.

bacterial endocarditis prophylaxis was required. 
Follow up information was received on 22 June 2009 via medical records. The 
patient was evaluated by cardiology as recently as 30 March 2009, and 
examination revealed a grade 3/6 systolic ejection murmur. Echocardiogram 
showed no residual atrial or ventricular septal defect, with mild tricuspid 
regurgitation and mild turbulence of flow across the interposition conduit 
and proximal descending aorta. The patient was assessed to be doing well from 
a cardiovascular standpoint. The cardiologist indicated that the patient 
"will eventually outgrow the 8 millimeter aortic interposition graft" and 
would require ''another operation when that occurs''. Subacute bacterial 
endocarditis was required. 
According to a television documentary aired 01 July 2013, the patient was 
currently seven years of age and was "small for his age." The mother stated 
she had taken Paroxetine for a few months during her pregnancy and had taken 
it during the first three months, "just as the baby's vital organs were 
forming." The patient was reported with a "valve missing in his heart,"
