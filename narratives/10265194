Medically Significant
A neurologist spontaneously reported via a Biogen Idec employee (Area Business Manager) that a 71 year old 
female patient on TYSABRI (300 mg, IV, QM) for Multiple Sclerosis from 13 Jun 2008 to an 23 Apr 2014 
experienced possible PML (onset Jun 2014). The neurologist stated that the patient had some congitive symptoms,
which were not entirely new, but seemed worse or at least concerning enough to draw CSF [for JCV DNA testing}. 
A CSF sample tested positive for JCV DNA on 09 Jun 2014 at (b) (6)  On an unknown date, the patient tested positive
for anti JCV antibodies. Treatment included PLEX, and at the time of this report, the patient was doing well. Per the 
TOUCH dosing database, the patient received a total of 71 doses of TYSABRI from 13 Jun 2008 to 23 Apr 2014. 
The causality for the event of possible PML is unknown. It is unknown if TYSABRI treatment is ongoing.

was tested for anti-JCV antibodies on 11 Mar 2011 (baseline); JCV antibodies were detected (0.291 nOD). On 26

Update 19 Sep 2014: The neurologist re-reported via MS TOUCH prescribing program form (TYSABRI initial

unknown if autopsy was done. Treatment and lab testing for the events were not reported. The causality for PML 
and death was not provided. TYSABRI therapy was discontinued.
Update 15 Oct 2014: The neurologist reported via a Biogen Idec employee (Medical Science Liaison) that the 
patient died on (b) (6)  and the cause of death was unknown. MRI on an unknown date showed suspicious 
PML lesion described as small parietal lesion on left. No further information was provided.
Update 30 Oct 2014: Biogen Idec considers this case to be confirmed for PML based on clinical presentation, 
positive CSF and radiologic evidence.
