(paracetamol) in the last evening (unspecified date). He was given per oral, lethal dose (LD) of N-acetylcysteine 
(NAC) (liquid) at 18.00. After ingestion of NAC, the patient had nausea. The diagnostic test on 08-MAR-2016, for 
APAP (acetaminophen) was 220 mcg/ml and continued NAC until it was less than 10 mcg/ml, liver function within 
normal limit and international normalized ratio and creatinine less than 2, aspartate aminotransferase was 34 (units 
unspecified) alanine aminotransferase as 12 (units unspecified), creatinine at 0.5 (units unspecified) and INR 
(international normalized ratio) was not checked. 
On 09-MAR-2016, the patient received 16 hour bag in 8 hours and was running it at the correct rate. On the same 
day APAP (acetaminophen) was 29 mcg/ml, AST (aspartate aminotransferase) was 61 (units unspecified), ALT 
(alanine aminotransferase) was 22 (units unspecified). The labs at 12 hour into the current bag AST ALT were 
normal, international normalized ratio and creatinine was less than 2.  The patient then received 8 hours of 
treatment. The 16 hour bag was restarted at the correct rate. The 16 hours of treatment was given as 4 hour bag, 8

an oral loading prior to the infusion. The patient was doing well, still some hour from16 hour NAC at 16 hour rate 
were left. At that time the APAP (acetaminophen) was less than 10mcg/ml, AST (aspartate aminotransferase) was 
19 (22) (units unspecified) ALT (alanine aminotransferase) was 45 (61) (units unspecified) INR (international 
normalized ratio) was 1.11 and cr (creatinine) 0.5 (units unspecified). It was reported that if APAP (acetaminophen) 
less than 2 mcg/ml, AST (aspartate aminotransferase), ALT (alanine aminotransferase) decreasing or within 
normal limit, creatinine and international normalized ratio less than 2, then it was ok to stop the infusion. If the labs 
do not meet these parameters continue the infusion and redraw the labs an hour prior to the end of the infusion. If 
the labs meet the criteria ok to stop, if not repeated the 16 hour bag at the same dose and same rate. The 
pharmacist reported that the patient was more comfortable completing the bag and also doing the labs again and 
still had some hours left on the 16 hour NAC at 16 hour rate at this time. It was reported that on the same day, the
