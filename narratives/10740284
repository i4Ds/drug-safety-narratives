Medically Significant
A neurologist spontaneously reported via a Biogen Idec Medical Science Liaison (MSL) that a female patient on 
TYSABRI (300 mg, IV, QM) for Multiple Sclerosis from 17 Dec 2004 to unknown date and then from 05 Sep 2006 
to 01 Nov 2014 experienced suspect PML (onset unknown). The patient is JCV antibody positive (dates unknown), 
with index levels ranging from 1.02 to 1.4. The patient was CSF JCV DNA positive at 2893 copies (date unknown). 
The patient had three MRIs (dates unknown), all with "no sign of PML." The patient has not had an infusion 
(presume TYSABRI) in two months, when she was showing signs of ataxia including "has lost balance and has 
difficulty walking" (presumed symptoms of suspect PML).  Per internal database information, the patient's first MS 
symptoms were in Jun 2004. Prior MS therapies included Rebif (interferon beta-1a) from 01 Jul 2004 to unknown 
date and Avonex (interferon beta-1a) from 11 Mar 2005 to 29 Aug 2006. The patient was enrolled in the 
(b) (6)  At the time of this report, the TOUCH database indicated that the patient had 
received 107 infusions of TYSABRI from 05 Sep 2006 to 25 Nov 2014 (date discrepant from what was reported) 
and an unknown number of infusions from 17 Dec 2004 to unknown date, prior to enrollment in the TOUCH 
program. Treatment for the event was not provided. The outcome for the event suspect PML is unknown. Causality 
for the event is unknown.  TYSABRI therapy was discontinued.
Update 26 Jan 2015: The following serum JCV antibody results were received from the (b) (6)  study ((b) (6) -
(b) (6) ): 16 Mar 2010 (baseline): detected (0.298 nOD-38); 28 Sep 2010: detected (0.511 nOD-38); 15 Mar 2011: 
detected (0.513 nOD-38); 30 Aug 2011: detected (0.28 nOD-38); 17 Apr 2012: detected (0.419 nOD-38).
Update 21 Apr 2015: Additional information was received from the neurologist, via a Biogen Medical Science 
Liaison (MSL), who reported that the patient was initially thought to have granule cell neuronopathy (GCN) and then
went on to develop PML. CSF JCV DNA from both (b) (6)  and(b) (6)  returned positive. The patient was seen by the 
neurologist on 20 Apr 2015 and had improved a bit. The patient will be seen again in approximately 2 weeks.
Update 22 Apr 2015: Additional information was received from a healthcare professional at the neurologist's office 
and included a completed standardized MS PML Data Collection Form, CSF results, laboratory results, office notes 
and MRI Reports. The 50 year old patient was diagnosed with MS in Jul 2004 with visual symptoms of optic neuritis
and sensory symptoms of banding sensation, paresthesias, and dysethesias. Prior immunomodulatory therapy 
included Avonex (interferon beta-1a) from Mar 2005 to Aug 2005 (date discrepant) and Rebif (interferon beta-1a) 
from Jul 2004 to Nov 2004. The patient did not receive prior immunosuppressant therapy. The patient received 3 
infusions of TYSABRI from Dec 2004 to Feb 2005 and 107 infusions from 05 Sep 2006 to 25 Nov 2014 with no 
interruption in dosing. Medical history included multiple sclerosis, chronic fatigue, depression, hyperlipidemia, 
insomnia, optic neuritis, transverse myelitis, migraines, and former smoker. Concomitant medications include 
Adderall (amphetamine and dextroamphetamine), Adderall XR (amphetamine and dextroamphetamine), Ambien

(zolpidem), Effexor (venlafaxine), Maxalt-MLT (rizatriptan benzoate), multivitamins with iron (NOS), simvastatin, 
Bio-D-Mulsion Forte (Vitamin D3), and Xanax (alprazolam). Previous serum anti-JCV antibody results were as 
follows: 08 Apr 2013 positive; 01 Nov 2013 positive (index 1.03); and 24 Mar 2014 positive (index 1.07). On an 
unknown date, TYSABRI neutralizing antibodies were negative. A brain MRI on 13 May 2014 (baseline) showed 
multiple T2 hyperintense signal abnormalities involve supratentorial WM and to a lesser extent corpus callosum. 
Findings consistent with demyelinating plaques. Appearance has not changed significantly in the interval since the 
prior study on 21 Jan 2014. 
Office visit notes from 02 Sep 2014 indicated that the patient was stable and relapse free. The patient received her 
104th infusion that day. Serum anti-JCV antibodies were positive (index 1.49) on 08 Sep 2014. Office visit notes 
from 30 Sep 2014 indicated that the patient felt she had deteriorated over the last 4 weeks and has to use hand rail 
with stairs, has unsteadiness, grinding teeth at night, bilateral hand clenching at night, and bilateral trigger thumb. 
Objective neurological exam was unchanged and no changes in MRI whatsoever. The neurologist felt that external 
stress was the most likely cause of the patient's complaints. The brain MRI on 30 Sep 2014 showed stable 
nonenhancing MS. Cervical and thoracic spine MRIs were performed in Oct 2014 to rule out disease progression or
other acute process. The MRIs were negative for new demyelination, disease worsening, or pathological 
enhancement. Office visit notes from 30 Dec 2014 indicated that the patient had experienced worsening gait and 
balance dysfunction for the past few months, unsteady Romberg, flattened affect and was very depressed. In spite 
of brain MRI appearing unchanged, a lumbar puncture was ordered to exclude PML. TYSABRI was discontinued 
with the patient's last dose (# 107) on 25 Nov 2014. Immune cell panel was normal and T and B cell flow cytometry 
from 23 Dec 2014 showed no acute process. JCV PCR in both whole blood and urine was negative on 30 Dec 
2014 and serum anti-JCV antibodies were positive (index 1.21). CSF JCV DNA (30 Dec 2014) from (b) (6)  was 
positive at 2,893 copies/ml and from (b) (6)  was positive at 1,453 copies/ml. The brain MRI on 30 Dec 2014 showed 
stable non-enhancing MS. Other specific lab results from Dec 2014 included the following: 03 Dec 2014: RDW 
16.7% (ref 11.5-14.5); 23 Dec 2014: Abs CD19+Lymphs 662/ul (ref 12-645); absolute CD3 2074/ul (ref 622-2402); 
absolute CD 4 Helper 1219/ul (ref 259-1519); Abs. CD8 Suppressor 989/ul (ref 109-897); CD19+lymphs 20.7% 
(3.3-25.4); CD3 Pos. lymph  64.8% (57.5-86.2); CD4 Pos. lymph 38.1% (30.8-58.5); CD8 Pos. lymph 30.9% (12.0-
35.5); CD4/CD8 ratio 1.23 (0.92-3.72); WBC 6.8 x 10^3/ul (3.4-10.8); RDW 18.1% (12.3-15.4); absolute lymphs 3.2
x10^3/ul (0.7-3.1); 30 Dec 2014: CSF immunoglobulin G 411 mg/dl (ref range 768-1632), CSF oligoclonal bands 
positive (ref range negative); CSF IgG/Albumin ratio 0.05 (ref range 0.09-0.25); oligoclonal bands, CSF Serum 
Number 3 (ref range 0-1).
On 12 Jan 2015 the neurologist received the CSF results and the patient was given a diagnosis of PML secondary 
to TYSABRI (presumed related causality). Treatment with mirtazapine (15 mg once daily) and maraviroc (150 mg 
twice daily for 7 days then increased to 300 mg twice daily) was initiated. Office visit notes from 13 Jan 2015 
reported that the patient continued to complain of balance dysfunction and feeling unsteady on her feet. Physical

exam showed unsteady, inconsistent, wide-based gait with spastic RLE. The patient was cognitively intact. The MRI
from 13 Jan 2015 (report not received) showed no change in demyelination pattern. No acute process, no 
edematous process, no mass effect, no evidence of PML. No pathological enhancement. The patient received 250 
mg of Solu-Medrol (methylprednisolone) on 13 Jan 2015 for prevention of IRIS. No plasma exchange at this time. 
Laboratory values from 19 Jan 2015 included the following: WBC 10.03 x10^3/ul (ref 4.5-10); RDW 15.5 (ref 11.5-
14.5); immature grans absolute 0.10 (ref 0.0-0.04); ALT 35 (ref 10-48); AST 24 (ref 13-43). C- and T-spine MRIs 
from 20 Jan 2015 showed no significant changes from previous studies. No pathological enhancement. Office visit 
notes from 27 Jan 2015 indicated that the patient complained of worsening balance dysfunction, feeling unsteady 
on her feet, fatigue, and feels like she weighs "1,000 pounds." Per the patient's husband, the patient has increased 
BLE weakness and has been tripping and falling more. Physical exam showed worsening, unsteady gait, with the 
patient cognitively intact. The neurologist was concerned about JCV granule cell neuronopathy (GCN); however this
was not substantiated on MRI so treatment continued for classic PML. The patient received additional doses of 250
mg IV Solumedrol on 16 Jan 2015, 20 Jan 2015 and will receive another dose on 27 Jan 2015 to prevent IRIS. 
Office visit notes from 10 Feb 2015 reported that the patient complained of lightheadedness with bending and 
standing, with no LOC (presume loss of consciousness), continued gait and balance dysfunction, and fatigue. The 
patient continues on mirtazapine and maraviroc and received additional doses of Solumedrol on 03 Feb and 10 Feb
2015. However, since 09 Feb 2015 lab results indicated an ALT of 74 and AST of 55, maraviroc was decreased to 
150 mg twice daily. A brain MRI on 17 Feb 2015 (compared to 12 Jan 2015 - date discrepant, previously reported 
as 13 Jan 2015) showed nonenhancing, demyelinating plaques involving the supratentorial WM are unchanged in 
size, number and appearance from prior studies. No new demyelinating plaques are present. On 17 Feb 2015, CSF
JCV DNA from (b) (6)  returned positive at 14,697 copies/ml and from (b) (6)  returned positive at 20,557 copies/ml. On
03 Mar 2015 a GCN CSF PCR analysis was received from (b) (6)
which indicated:  We have amplified JCV from the CSF you sent us, using primers in the C terminus of the VP1 
capsid protein, that encompass the mutations usually found in JCV GCN. We found that this sample contains at 
least 2 types of JCV, one that is the same size as the wild-type, and one that is slightly shorter, consistent with the 
JCV GCN mutation." Laboratory results from 09 Mar 2015 included the following: WBC 8.38 x10^3/ul; hemoglobin 
15.2 g/dl (12-15); hematocrit 44.2% (37.2-46.3); MCV 97.6 FL (80-97); MCH 33.6 pg (27-32); RDW 12.7%; ALT 25;
AST 19. 
A brain MRI on 11 Mar 2015 showed: multiple poorly defined areas of high T2-weighted signal are seen in and 
adjacent to left middle, superior and inferior cerebellar peduncles. There is involvement of the adjacent vermis, 
more prominently on the left side. Multiple punctate areas of contrast enhancement are seen in these regions. 
Solitary focus of enhancement is suspected on the right side at the level of the right middle cerebellar peduncle. 
Ventricles are not dilated nor effaced. No midline shift. Several foci of high T2-weighted signal involve supratentorial
WM more prominently in a perilateral ventricular distribution. No other areas of pathologic contrast enhancement 
are seen. No intra or extraaxial mass or fluid collection. No areas of restricted diffusion. Impression: Multiple poorly

defined areas of high T2-weighted signal involve left cerebellar peduncles and left cerebellar vermis. Numerous 
punctate areas of enhancement are associated. There is effacement of the left superior cerebellar peduncle. These
findings are new in the interval since the prior study. These changes are consistent with PML. Multiple 
supratentorial lesions are consistent with demyelinating plaques and are not significantly changed in the interval 
since the prior study. Office visit notes from 23 Mar 2015 report that the patient remains markedly ataxic and is 
using walker and wheelchair; however, the neurologist felt the patient was more steady, with negative Romberg 
with eyes closed while sitting. The patient remains cognitively intact. The patient remains off disease modifying 
therapy for what appears to be a granule cell neuronopathy variant of PML due to TYSABRI (presume related 
causality). Additional doses of IV Solumedrol were received and the patient started prednisone 20 mg three times 
daily four days ago (presume 19 Mar 2015). Intramuscular Zofran (ondansetron) was being given for nausea, and 
Acthar (repository corticotropin) was initiated on 23 Mar 2015. Maraviroc therapy continues. On 08 Apr 2015, CSF 
JCV DNA from (b) (6)  returned positive at 6,804 copies/ml and from(b) (6)  returned positive at 13,258 copies/ml. A 
brain biopsy had not been performed. At the time of this report, the patient was at home. Causality for the events of 
elevated AST and elevated ALT was unknown.
Update 30 Apr 2015: On 30 Apr 2015 Biogen considers this case confirmed for PML based on positive CSF, 
consistent radiological findings, and clinical symptoms; GCN case.
Update 01 May 2015: Additional information was received from the neurologist. MRI images from 13 May 2014, 30 
Sep 2014, 30 Dec 2014, 11 Mar 2015, and 01 Apr 2015 were received; corresponding reports with findings were 
not provided at this time (note: reports for MRI's dated 13 May 2014, 30 Sep 2014, 30 Dec 2014, and 11 Mar 2015 
were previously provided by the neurologist in the 22 Apr 2015 update).
Update 01 Sep 2015: The patient's neurologist reported via a TYSABRI six month discontinuation questionnaire 
that the patient was currently alive. No further details were provided.
