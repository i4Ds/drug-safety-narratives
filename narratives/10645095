Medically Significant
A neurologist spontaneously reported via a Biogen Idec Medical Science Liaison (MSL) that an adult female patient 
on TYSABRI (300 mg, IV, QM) for Multiple Sclerosis from unknown date to Jan 2014 experienced suspicious of 
PML (onset unknown). The MSL indicated that the patient discontinued TYSABRI in Jan 2014 and has been on 
Tecfidera since Jul 2014 (discrepant information; MSL also indicated Tecfidera therapy started in Apr 2014). The 
patient had "spinal signs (NOS) in Jun [2014]" and currently has cognitive issues (NOS); however, it was noted that 
the patient had cognitive problems prior to initiating TYSABRI.  The patient was noted to have a spinal cord lesion 
in Jul 2014 (presume on MRI) and a brainstem lesion in Sep 2014 (presume on MRI). A recent scan (presumed 
MRI, date not provided) revealed worsening and a new spinal brainstem lesion. The patient is also scheduled to 
have a spinal tap to confirm possible PML (date not provided). Treatment for the event was not provided. The 
outcome for the event suspicious of PML is unknown. Causality for the event was assessed as related to TYSABRI.
 TYSABRI therapy was discontinued.
