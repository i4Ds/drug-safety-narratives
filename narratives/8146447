This clinical trial case ) concerns a 71 year old Caucasian 
male. The patients medical history included idiopathic pulmonary 1 rosis. Concomitant medication included: folic 
acid, vitamin B12 and dexamethasone for prophylaxis as per the protocol, granisetron hydrochloride for prophylaxis 
and captopril for hypertension. On 28-Feb-2011, the patient first received pemetrexed 500 mg/m2 in combination 
with cisplatin 75 mg/m2, intravenously, and bevacizumab 7.5 mg/kg on day one every 21 days for the treatment of 
advanced non-small cell lung cancer. The last dose of cisplatin administered prior to the event onset was on the 05-
May-2011 and on the 01-Sep-2011 for pemetrexed and bevacizumab. On the 05-Sep-2011 the patient started to 
experience dyspnea and rectal hemorrhage. Laboratory data on the 05-Sep-2011 included neutrophils 12.7 
(reference range 1-5.4), leukocytes 14.4 (reference range 3.7-11.6), platelets 180 (reference range 125-350). On 
4111.11111. In months since the last cisplatin dose andel:lays since the last pemetrexed and bevacizumab, 
the patient was hospitalised with dyspnea and rectal hemorrhage and was diagnosed with pancytopenia grade 4. 
The atient had no pain. Laboratory data included: hemoglobin 7.9 (reference range 13-17.3),r 
neutrophils 0.57, leukocytes 1.1. The patient underwent a chest x-ray, abdominal x-ray, electrocardiogram. 
Blood tests and blood, urine and stool cultures. It was reported that the final diagnosis was pancytopenia 
autolimited rectal hemorrhage, multifactorial respiratory failure that was aggravated by a respiratory infection and 
urinary tract infection with candida albcans (clarification requested for event terms). The rectal haemorrhage ws a 
consequence of low platelet count. The patient was treated with oxygen, corticotherapy, antibiotic therapy including 
fluconazole, aerdiol therapy, transfusions of erythrocytes and platelets, filgrastim and benzodiazepines. On the III 
the patients platelet count was 26 and on the the patients hemoglobin was 10.4. On the 
the patient had recovered from both events an was isc arged from hospital the same day. No action 
was taken with study drugs in response to the events. The investigator stated that the event of pancytopenia was 
related to all study drugs but was not related to protocol procedures. The event of dyspnea was not related to study 
drugs or to protocol procedures. This case is linked with ES201108009237 and ES201108002289 (same patient, 
different clinical episode). Further information received on the 16-Sep-2011 was processed and entered with initial 
case. Update 13-Oct-2011: Additional information received from investigator on 10-Oct-2011. Changed event of 
rectal haemorrhage to pancytopenia. Added folic acid, vitamin B12 and dexamethasone as concomitant
