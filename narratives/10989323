The hematologist did not provide the causal relationship for event progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy with

No further information was provided.
Additional information was received on 23/Apr/2015. Following information was added to the case: patient's details, 
therapy details of rituximab, new concomitant medications (fludarabine phosphate and cyclophosphamide), event 
term Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy ( previously suspicion of progressive multifocal 
leukoencephalopathy), outcome of  progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy persisting ( previously not 
reported) and event description.
Additional information was received on 30/Apr/2015. Following information was added to the case: units of lab test 
(WBC and ANC).
Additional information was received on 10/Jun/2015, following information was added to the case : On 
(b) (6)  he had died due to the event progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, outcome of the event was 
changed to fatal (previously reported as not recovered), seriousness changed to death (previously reported as initial
hospitalization), event description was updated.
This confirmed case of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) is being expedited per
