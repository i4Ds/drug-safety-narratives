Initial Report Date: 04-JUN-2015
A report had been received from a literature article concerning a patient  of unknown age and gender who had 
received tenofovir/emtricitabine and lopinavir/ritonavir.
Relevant medical and concomitant medications were not reported. Patient was a known case of HIV 1 infection.
Author conducted a randomized clinical trial study to compare the immune reconstitution achieved using efavirenz-
based HAART with that of a ritonavir-boosted PI-based regimen (atazanavir and lopinavir) in severely 
immunosuppressed antiretroviral-naive HIV-1-infected patients. Between July 2007 and March 2010, a total of 112 
patients were screened for inclusion in the study. Of these, 89 were eligible. patients were randomly assigned to 1 
of 3 treatment arms in a 1:1:1 ratio, as follows: tenofovir (TDF, 300 mg daily) plus emtricitabine [FTC, 200 mg daily 
(Truvada)] combined with efavirenz [EFV 600 mg daily (TDF + FTC + EFV)] as the NNRTI or atazanavir-ritonavir 
[300/100 mg daily] or lopinavir-ritonavir [400/100 mg twice a day as ritonavir-boosted PI].
In present case on an unknown date patient was scheduled to receive tenofovir 300 mg daily plus emtricitabine 200
mg daily via unknown route, lopinavir-ritonavir 400/100 mg twice a day via unknown route.
On an unspecified date patient experienced progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy in new C events. Relevant 
lab details and treatment received were not provided.
At the time of the report action taken with tenofovir/emtricitabine and lopinavir/ritonavir was withdrawn.
The outcome of the event progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy was unknown.
The event progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy was considered as serious due to seriousness criteria of 
important medical event.
