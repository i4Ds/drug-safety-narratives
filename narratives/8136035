pactitaxel 175mg/m2; adtrrinistered intravenously (IV) at an unknown frequency, for the treatment of non-small cell 
lung cancer. Last dose of study drugs received prior to the events was on 30-Dec-2010. On MOM lbdays

internationall o sad ratio was 1.2. No sign of superior vena cave obstruction. Computerised a 0 Orem scan of 
head on the same day .0 no evidence of hemorrhage, hydrocephalus, possible watershed and infarcts. CT 
scan of head did not show picture typical of cerebral metastasis. Chest x-ray on the same day s . -0 right lung

ischernia. Chest examination s -0 bilateral creps, reduced air entry and right side was scattered. On the Nip 
patient was ind. f ,-0 with upper respiratory tract infection. They could not identify if it was pneumonia. 
Patient was given IV fluids and IV arnmdciliiniciavulanate potassium, nil by o as swallowing assessment was 
pa	 a.  The patient was kept comfortable and was treated for chest infection. As a -  ive treatment patient 
received ventolin and paracetamol for infection/pneumonia in addition to the amoxicillin/clavulanate potassium, 
acid for pyrexia and morphine, hyoscine and midazolam for patient comfort. However, patient died on 
the and the primary reported cause of death was community acquired pneumonia, secondary to 
metastatic lung cancer. The event of upper respiratory infection was reported with a fatal outcome (event term to be 
o ) It was if an autopsy was performed. The patient had not recovered from muscle weakness right 
sided at time of death. Therapy with both study drugs was discontinued as a result of the events. In the 
investigator's no  0 , the event muscle weakness right side, was possibly related to both pemetrexed and
