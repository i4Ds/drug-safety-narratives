Medically Significant
A medical doctor reported that a female patient on TYSABRI (unknown dose, IV, unknown frequency) for an 
unknown indication, received 29 infusions, from unknown date to unknown date experienced suspected PML (onset
unknown) with paresis of nervus facialis (onset unknown). Testing included MRI on an unspecified date which 
showed very suspicious finding. CSF JCV PCR would be tested. No treatment was reported. The outcome for the 
event suspected PML is unknown. The causality for the event of suspected PML is unknown.  It is unknown if 
TYSABRI treatment is ongoing.
Update 08 Jan 2015: Follow-up information was received from the physician.  CSF was sent for JCV DNA testing.
The patient is receiving corticosteroid therapy and the clinical status is unchanged.

FOIA Case Report Information
Update 13 Jan 2015: Based on Biogen Idec internal review of MRI images, this case is now considered high 
suspect for PML.
Update 14 Jan 2015: Follow-up information was received from the physician.  On 30 Apr 2014 the patient tested 
positive for JCV antibodies with an index of 0.641.  The last infusion of TYSABRI was on 12 Dec 2014.  The patient 
had no prior immunosuppressive therapy.  CSF was sent for testing (JCV PCR) by (b) (6)  on 08 Jan 2015; results 
are pending. The patient was treated with Solumedrol (methylprednisolone) and mirtazapine (last week) and PLEX 
(plasma exchange) is planned.
Update 15 Jan 2015: Follow-up information received indicated CSF tested positive with a result of 1403 copies/ml.
Update 15 Jan 2015: Biogen Idec considers this case confirmed for PML based on positive CSF, consistent 
radiologic evidence, and clinical symptoms.
Update 27 Jan 2015: Follow-up information received indicated the clinical symptomatology had worsened.  MRI 
worsened with a finding within the meaning of multilobar PML.  The patient completed 5 cycles of PLEX every other
day.  On 27 Jan 2015, CSF was collected for re-testing of JCV DNA due to monitoring of dynamics after PLEX.
Update 05 Mar 2015: Follow-up information was received from the neurologist. The patient's clinical status was 
significantly deteriorated with hemiplegia present and the MRI was significantly worsened showing advanced IRIS.
The female patient is receiving intravenous pulse corticosteroid therapy. CSF sample (liquor) was taken on 05 Mar 
2015 to follow dynamic changes in the number of JCV DNA replications.
Update 30 Jun 2015: Follow-up information was received from the neurologist. TYSABRI was administered at a 
dose of 300 mg, IV. The patient has stabilized with no improvement observed in the clinical picture. Control MRI 
(date not provided. showed some signs of IRIS decline. CSF JCV DNA testing is planned for 10 Jul 2015. 
Corticosteroid treatment will be gradually discontinued.
