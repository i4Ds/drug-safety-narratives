This medically-confirmed, serious literature report (initial receipt: 24-Mar-2015) concerns a 23-year-old male who 
was admitted to the hospital with weakness on his left side. In early childhood, he was hospitalized for recurrent 
sinopulmonary infections. He had suffered from measles infection, recurrent dermatitis and molluscum 
contagiosum since early childhood. Besides he experienced labial herpes simplex virus infection at least two times 
in a year. His parents were first degree cousins. One of his five siblings died because of meningitis at the age of 
five. He had hyper IgE syndrome with serum IgE value of 854 UI/mL (0-87 UI/ml). 
A radiological diagnosis of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy was considered most likely. A lung mass 
was surgically resected histologically reported as diffuse large b-cell lymphoma. He was treated with intravenous 
IVIg (brand name, manufacturer and batch number were not reported; unapproved indication, not explicitly 
reported) and cidofovir for 6 months. 
His symptoms did not improve and he continued to deteriorate and died 6 months after diagnosis.
Company comment:
Seriousness: Death
Listedness: Unlisted. As the brand name of the administered product was not reported, case is assessed with 
regards to Privigen CCSI which is licensed in the country of the report. Although the events of 'symptoms did not 
improve' and 'continued to deteriorate' would normally be considered listed, due to fatal outcome, the events are 
considered unlisted. 
Causality: Unrelated. A therapeutic effect in an unapproved indication cannot be expected. The patient's underlying 
hyper IgE syndrome provides an alternative explanation for deterioration in progressive multifocal 
leukoencephalopathy. Cidofovir was administered concurrently and therefore also considered a co-suspect drug.
