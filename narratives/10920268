Medically Significant
A health care professional from the medical doctor's office reported that a male patient on TYSABRI (300 mg, IV, 
QM) for Multiple Sclerosis from 12 Nov 2013 to unknown date and enrolled in a Biogen Idec sponsored marketing 
program of Monitored Therapy had a recent lumbar puncture test (date and results unknown).  The reason for the 
lumbar puncture test was not provided.  Internal databases indicated the following:  The patient tested JCV positive 
(date and index unknown), onset of MS symptoms was in Sep 2012, prior MS and immunosuppressant therapy 
was unknown; and the patient was not enrolled in Stratify study.  At the time of this report the TOUCH database 
indicated that the patient received a total of 16 doses of TYSABRI from 12 Nov 2013 to 16 Jan 2015.  The outcome
of the lumbar puncture test is unknown. The causality of the lumbar puncture test in relation to TYSABRI is 
unknown.  TYSABRI therapy was stopped temporarily; results of lumbar puncture test will have to be reviewed 
before resuming therapy.

male patient was being evaluated for possible PML.  Towards the beginning of Feb (presume 2015), the patient 
started having subtle "thought" changes and behavioral changes - described as the patient tried to jump out of a 
moving car".  No immunosuppressant history was reported. JCV Ab testing in Aug 2014 was positive with an index 
of 0.61 (presume in reference to the previously reported internal databased JCV test). The patient underwent a LP 
on 12 Feb 2015.  CSF was sent to (b) (6)  for JCV PCR testing and results returned "indeterminate". The registered 
nurse was unsure if an ultrasensitive quantitative PCR was performed or if it was the less sensitive quantitative 
PCR Focus has.  A MRI was performed on 23 Feb 2015; results were described as "negative for suspicious 
lesions" by the registered nurse. A repeat LP is planned, but has not yet been scheduled, to determine if the patient 
experienced a MS relapse or PML. Patient was currently at home and stable and had not been hospitalized. 
Update 27 Feb 2015:  Additional information was provided by the same registered nurse.  CSF report was provided,
results from (b) (6)  showed inconclusive quantification of JCV DNA detected (reference range: < 50 copies/ml) of 
CSF sample collected on 12 Feb 2015 (previously reported). Relevant lab reports from 12 Feb 2015 were provided;
results showed the following:  Immunoglobulin G, CSF of 3.8 mg/dL (reference range of 0.0 to 6.0); albumin, CSF 
of 22 mg/dL (reference range:  0 to 35); CSF IgG/Albumin ratio of 0.17 (reference range:  0.09 to 0.25); CSF 
Oligoclonal bands of 3 (reference range:  0 to 1); CSF Oligoclonal bands number was positive (reference range: 
negative); CSF IgG synthesis rate of 0.0 (reference range: <=8.0); myelin basic protein of 2.68 ng/ml (reference 
range of 0.00 to 5.50); CSF culture results showed no WBCs, no organisms, no growth for 4 days; CSF was clear 
and colorless with cell counts of WBC <1/uL (reference range: 0 to 5) and RBC of <1/uL  (reference range: 0 to 1); 
glucose, CSF of 65 mg/dL (reference range: 40 to 70); protein, CSF of 40 mg/dL (reference range: 12 to 60); CSF 
differential showed lymphocytes of 86%, monocyte/macrophage of 14% (reference range not provided).  No 
malignant cells were identified on non-gyn cytology exam. 
Update 05 Mar 2015: Upon an outbound call to the medical doctor's office, the same registered nurse reported that 
the patient was home and stable with no new or worsening symptoms.  At this time, no repeat LP had been 
performed. A follow-up appointment was scheduled for 27 Mar 2015, which will determine next steps after the 
patient has been evaluated.
Update 05 Mar 2015:  MRI reports from 16 Jan 2015 and 23 Feb 2015 were provided by the same registered 
nurse. MRI brain 16 Jan 2015, with/without contrast (comparison MRI brain 01 May 2014): Findings: New 
subcortical white matter lesion within the right frontal lobe. Stable deep right frontal white matter disease near the 
vertex. The deep and subcortical lateral left frontal white matter lesion is unchanged. An amorphous periventricular 
lesion at the posterior aspect of the right lateral ventricle, unchanged. Deep left frontal pericallosal white matter 
lesion is stable. White matter lesions within the internal capsule bilaterally are stable. White matter lesion at the left 
occipital horn is stable. No infratentorial white matter lesions. No enhancing lesions. No evidence of restricted 
diffusion, hemorrhage, mass effect or midline shift. Incidental small developmental venous anomaly within the

rnedial left cerebellar hemisphere. Impression: 1. No large areas of confluent T'2 signal to suggest PML. Of note, 
as stated on the prior exam, early imaging changes of PML may be indistinguishable from multiple sclerosis plaque 
progression. 2. New subcortical riqht frontal white matter lesion. This finding is concerning for interval myelination 
since  May 2014. No enhancement to suggest active plaque. 3. Otherwise stable deep, subcortical, pericallosal and
periventricular white matter' lesions consistent with known multiple sclerosis. 4. Unchanged mild generalized 
parenchymal atrophy, advanced for age. 5. New left ethmoid and frontal paranasal sinus disease. MRI brain 23 Feb
2015, with/without contrast (comparison MRI brain 16 Jan 2015): Findings: MR spectroscopy reveals two averages 
for the various metabolite ratios to be within 2 standard deviations of normal. Choline/creatine is normal. 
Choline/NAA measures 1.54. NAA/creatine measures 1.18: This reflects a decrease in the choline/NAA ratio as 
compared to the prior study. Multifocal periventricular and subcortical white rnatter lesions consistent with 
demyelinating disease are stable in appearance. Involvement of the left cerebral peduncle is also stable. No new 
white matter lesions. Unchanged foci of involvement within the corpus callosum are present. Post contrast 
sequences reveal normal meningeal and vascular enhancement. No enhancing parenchymal lesions. No mass 
effect or midline shift. Para-nasal sinuses are clear. Impression: Stable multifocal white matter lesions of MS 
without significant MR findings of progression. No areas of abnormal enhancement to suggest active 
demyelination) Findings: MR spectroscopy reveals two averages for the various metabolite ratios to be within 2
