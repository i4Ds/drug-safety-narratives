ng/mL. He was previously treated with cisplatin 50rng injection to the right pleural space on 01-Nov-2006, three 
courses chemotherapy with gemcitabine hydrochloride (Gernzar) and aoo atin from 14-Nov-2006 to 01-Mar-

effusion (onset date not provided) and asbestosis. He received multiple concomitant medications including 
omeprazole, magnesium oxide, loxoprofen sodium, teprenone for prophylaxis for side effects. Supplementation 
included folic acid and vitamin B12. As of 03-Apr-2007, performance status at initiation of protocol on the 
EOCG/Zubrod scale was 0. As of 05-Apr-2007, auscultation showed remarkable findings but chest X-ray and chest 
computed tomography (CT) a  no findings of interstitial lung disease (ILD). The patient received pemetrexed 
500 mg/m"2 and cispiatin 75 mgirn-42 intravenously for pleural mesothelioma malignant beginning on 10-Apr-2007. 
On 12-Apr-2007, chest X-ray showed unremarkable findings. On 18-Apr-2007, K

up as a result of lung biopsy, alveolar epithelium was found but there were no notable findings of interstitial 
pneumonitis. Sa02 was 96%. The following examinations were not performed: respiratory function test, 
car am, bronchoalveolar lavage, sputum culture, blood culture, drug lymphocyte stimulation test. On 
111111111 study drugs were discontinued. Sa02, Pa02 and PaCO2 were 93%, 76Torr and 36.8Torr, respectively. 
Oil ingiu1 mp, chest X-ray showed ground glass shadow and reticular shadow in both lower lung fields and oral 
prednisolorie 30 ing/day was started. Sa02, Pa02 and PaCO2 were 95%, 71Torr and 38.1Torr, respectively. No 
inhalation of o 0., was performed. On , chest HRCT showed improvement tendency of ground glass 
shadow and reticular shadow in both lowerung fields. Sa02, Pa02 and PaCO2 were 95%, 79Torr and 37.6Torr, 
respectively. The interstitial pneumonitis was improved. On 26-May-2007, predonisolone was decreased to 25 
mg/day. On 02-Jun-2007, predonisolone was decreased to 20 mg/day. On 09-Jun-2007, predonisolone was 
decreased to 15 mg/day. On 12-Jun-2007, chest X-ray showed reticular shadow and improvement tendency of
