This subsidiary transitioned medical affairs trial . 
concerns 62 year old male Caucasian patient. 
Medical his ory tnc myeloproliferative disorder (polycythemia vera and myelodysplastic disorder), lung 
adenocarcinoma, aspiration pleural cavity, pleural effusion, tobacco user (1-2 packs daily for 40 years), 
hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, gastroesophageal reflux disease and gastric ulcers. Concomitant medications 
included acetylsalicylic acid, dexamethasone, lactulose, hydroxyurea, megestrol acetate, mirtazapine, omeprawle, 
prochlorperazine maleate, simvastatin, and supplementation with folic acid and cyanocobalamin. On 28Feb2011, 
the patient received the first and last dose prior to the event of cetuximab (Erbitux) 756 m , in combination with 
pemetrexed (Alimta) 945 mg and cisplatin 142 mg, for the treatment of NSCLC. On 4111111days after 
first and last dose of study drugs, the patient was hospitalized for dyspnea and elevated Troponin. 
Electrocardiogram (EKG) demonstrated sinus tachycardia. Laboratory data demonstrated Troponin 0.019, repeat 
Tro0o 0.018, activated partial thromboplastin time 30.1 seconds, prothrombin time 10.4 sec, white bl 0 00 cell 
count 36.9 and arterial 0 e  0 gas (ABG) showed pH 7.44, pCO2 45, p02 57, base excess 5.6, bicarbonate 30.6, 
carbon dioxide 32, and oxygen saturation 90% (additional laboratory data available in source documentation.) 
Computerized to o g ram chest yielded left lung field significantly worsened since 09Feb2011; negative for 
pulmonary embolism; right pleural effusion; and patchy interstitial changes. Chest x-ray demonstrated stable right 
lower lobe consolidation and infiltrate; interstitial prominence had slightly worsened. Patient came in on four liters 
breathing at 90-92 % oxygen. He began to de-saturate down to the 80s, at which point he was treated with 15 liters 
of oxygen and was given another and extra dose of methylprednisolone 125 mg. It was then determined to put the 
patient on bilevel positive airway pressure (BIPAP) for the night and started him on imipenem and vancomycin 
along with the levofloxacin that was started in the emergency department. Ipratropium bromide/salbutamol was also 
given and methylprednisolone 80 mg was scheduled every six hours. Thoracentesis would be considered if 
symptoms persisted. In regards of his elevated Troponin levels (possible non-ST segment elevated myocardial 
infarction), treatment included morphine and nitroglycerin; echocardiogram would also be considered per EKG 
results. 041111111M the patient had recovered and was discharged from the hospital. Both the dyspnea and 
elevated troponin Havels had recovered. There was no change in study drugs as a result of these events. In the 
opinion of the investigator, the events of dyspnea and elevated Troponin were not related to study therapy. The 
events were unrelated to trial protocol procedures. Update 15Mar2011: Upon review on 14Mar2011, it was 
determined that case US201103002968 was follow-up to this report; therefore, it will be deleted from the database. 
All information in case US201103002968 was captured in this case. The additional information was received from 
investigator on 08Mar11: Updated event outcome for both events to recovered; added hospital discharge date; 
corrected relatedness for dyspnea from yes to no (previously reported); updated narrative with additional 
information. Update 16Mar11: Additional information received from the investigator on 11Mar11. Relatedness for 
elevated Troponin changed to not related to study therapy. Case and narrative updated.
