.EariefiNProbleint Narrative: 
Thils.04$0, described in the literature of a journal of medical case reports, concerns a 49-years old Caucasian 
feraiepatient. The patienrs medical history included stage IV squamous cell lung cancer (cT4 N3 Ml, multiple 
ptilriariary . .). She had a smoking history of 20 pack years. Palliative chemotherapy was initiated with 
carbOpfaitinAX 3 and paclitaxel 75 rrigim2 on days one, eight and 15, and repeated every 28 days. Radiation 
therapy for painful left-sided plexus.brachialls infiltration withpartial arm paresis was pert  concurrently during 
cycielteaandthree. At dose of 39 Gy was administered in 1.3 fractions with 6 x a0  s over a total treatment 
timelafiteci and a haif weeks. A conformal plan with equally weighted  0 a  a.a irig fields from antero-posterior and 
poSteresanterior was used. During r   a    apy, the patient developed typical symptoms of radiation dermatitis. 
The initially dry maculopapular rash and-pniritis worsened one week after completion of radiotherapy to National 
Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (NCI-CTC) grade 3 with erythema and small ulcerations in the media-
scapular and cervical left radiation fields. The acute dermatitis resolved within three weeks after application of local 
and systemic steroids. The subsequent chemotherapy cycles did not cause any further dermal problems and 
resulted in a partial r .00 se after a total of six cycles. Three months later, the pulmonary metastases progressed 
and a new adrenalmass was detected on her right side. The concomitant medications included :folic acid, vitamin 
1312 and dexamethasone for   therapy. The patient took pemetrexed (Aiimia) 500 mg/m2, unknown 
frequency and route, for the treatment of stage IV squamous cell lung cancer  0 t on-an unknown date, 
reported as eight months after comp4etion of r   therapy. On an unknown date, reported as after the first 
dose, the patient  ,:!0    - A  increasingdysaethesia in the  o radiation area, however, no skin reaction was 
detected on Elite e   - ;0 ,  .  The s   a  dose of pemetrexed was given three weeks later. On an unknown 
date, reported as one week after the second infusion, the patient developed massive dermatitis (determined by the 
compeny as serious for other medically significant reasons) in the area of the former radiation field, strictly 
restricted to the beck and sparing the front of the radiation field. Direct tumour infiltration of the skin was excluded 
by skin biopsy. The 6 ' of radiation recall dermatitis was suggested and pemetrexed was stopped. 
Corrective treatment included immediate local and systemic treatment with steroids (60 mg of prectnisone) and 
antibiotics (arnoxicillin). On an unknown date, reported as over the following two weeks, a  0  .a  6  sive necrosis of 
the skin and underlying soft tissue ; -    ;0 (determined by the company as serious for other medically significant 
reasons). This reportedly causedmassive pain and immobilisation of the left shoulder and arm (non serious). A 
;Logical , .  t of the necrosis and a musculus latissimus dorsi flap from the contralateral side as well as 
p . coverage will, a cutaneous mesh craft were performed. The muscle flap  a  e,    necrotic and in _
& second   , the flap was removed. The large tissue defect showed no signs of improvernentdespite 
intensive local wound care. On the contrary, continuous destruction occurred with involvement of the scapula. Due 
tot*  a  a. o' necrosis with  deteriorating 00.: 0' ion of the patient, further chemotherapy was abstained. On an 
unknown date, reported as 16 : after chemotherapy had been stopped, the patient died of uncontrolled local 
infection. and concurrent pneumonia. It was unknown if an autopsy was performed, and no other relevant physical 
findings were reported. The authors stated that pemetrexed was the probable cause of the radiation recall 
dermatitis with aciftlissue necrosis, as this was the only new drug used at the time. This case was described in the

'5 ,  N0,0  . 0' related to prior surgeries, cholecystectorny, knee surgery, lobectoniy, cataract repair and an allergy to 
clarithromycin. The patient's history was negative for smoking or drinking. Concomitant medications included: 
folic acid, montelukast, atorvastatin, gernlibrozil, levothyroxine, diltiazem, carisoprodol, acetylsalicylic acid, 
hydrochtorothiazide, raloxifene, ezetimibe, bimatoprost, salbutamol, esomeprazole, olopatactine, 
hydro o,o 6  ../par and a multivitamin. Supplementation status was not provided for vitamin B12. On 
03Sep08, the patient first received pemetrexed disodium (Alimta), 500 mg/m2, in  o  .o 'nation with gemcitabine 
;   0 0 01  0 e (Gernzar), 1500 mg/m2 in combination with bevacizumab, 10 mg/kg, all on day 1 and day  every 
Ellsdays, for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer. Several weeks prior to the patient's admission, the patient 
had a hentoglobin (1lgb) of 7.6 and was transfused with two units of red cells. The cause of this was unclear, but it 
wt pro , that this was atypical for the chemotherapy. A recent (date not provided) echo. : o,o  : . showed 
Rassibia diastolic dysfunction suggested by E to A reversal. On 04Feb09, study drugs were last received prior to 
ifae4vertts. 00.1111.111kfive days after last doses of study drugs, the patient was admitted for a grade 4 gastric 
dicer with acute 0 00 4  loss anemia. It was pro by the family that the patient had been having black, tarry 
stools for several days prior to the ad a  . She had gastrointestinal symptoms of worsening of her baseline 
GERD. The patient had no nausea, vomiting, hernoptysis, hematemasis, fever or chills. Vital signs were: pulse 
018, respirations 22, temperature 98.3 and blood pressure 129/77. Labs were: white blood cells (WBC) 17.6, 
*solute neutrophil count (ANC) 4.3, hemoglobin (Hgb) 6.2 and platelets (pit) 198. Chemistry was essentially 
Blood cultures were negative times two. Urinalysis and urine culture were negative. Liver function 
was reported as relatively unremarkable and kidney function was stable. Additional labs included: iron 97, total

Alfdplenal labs in source document. The patient received four units of packed red blood cells. A gastrointestinal 
cons* showed the patient had chronic dyspepsia, indigestion, loose diarrhea stools, since starting chemotherapy 
and a several day history of black and tarry stools. She had recently received high dose steroids. The patient was 
negative for any bright, red rectal bleeding and no postmenopausal vaginal bleeding. She had odynophagia and 
oral thrush. There was some question about the patient having been taking ibuprofen. The patient reported to a 
nurse that she had been taking ibuprofen, however the family denied that she had received it. It was felt the patient 
had a possible upper gastrointestinal bleed. It was recommended that she start a proton inhibitor, have an 
esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGO-) and blood transfusions to maintain Hgb > 9.0. On an EGD 
showed diffuse esophagitis, a hiatal hernia and two ulcers in the gastric antrum, the greatest about 1.5 centimeters, 
one was quite deep and both were on the lesser curvature; biopsies were taken. The biopsies were negative for 
 6.0 pylori, unease enzyme, dysplasia or malignancy and was reactive to gastropathy/ chemical gastritis 
with focal ulceration and reactive changes. Labs were: WBC 5.8, ARC 4.3, Hgb 11.2 and pit 111. Prothrombin

esomeprazole was increased to twice daily. Her acetylsalicylic acid therapy was discontinued and she was to not 
have any exposure to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). On it was provided that study 
drugs were held. On labs were: WBC 1.2, ANC 0.5, Hgb 10.2 and pit 64. Chemistry was essentially 
unremarkable. On the patient was recovering from the gastric ulcers and was discharged. The patient 
was discontinued from the study protocol, no reason provided and folic acid was discontinued. On 
days after last doses of study drugs, the patient was re-admitted to the hospital after awakening with profuse 
epistaxis. it was provided there was no trauma to initiate the bleeding. She required nasal catheter packing and 
lihinostat" rocket to finatiocnhitrol the bleeding. She received multiple units of red blood cells and platelets. 
Platelets were 31. On the patient recovered from the Staxis, however subsequently developed 
respiratory distress with decreasing oxygen saturations. On 111Mlplatelets were 55. She was intubated, 
placed on a ventilator and had a chest tube inserted for possible prieumothorax. The patient was coded and 
eventually expired on 0212. The cause of death was provided as respiratory failure from possible 
pneLlmortia andfar  .ssive disease after increasing hypoxia and desaturation Orr* the previous day. The 
cause of death provided on the death certificate was lung cancer (disease progression, which is exempt from 
reporting). An autopsy was not performed.  In the opinion of the study investigator, the epistaxis was related to 
study drugs. The gastric ulcers with acute blood loss were related to the bevacizurnab with non-compliant NSAID 
use as a possible causative factor and were not related to the pemetrexed and gemcitabine. The respiratory failure 
was unlikely related to study therapy. The death from progressive disease was unrelated to study therapy as the 
patienrs respiratory status 6 ; 0  throughout the day before and the day of death. Update 23Feb09: Additional 
information received on 19Feb09 and  * 6  ;s sed with initial report. Update 02Mar09: Additional information 
received on 26Feb09 from study investigator. Added fatal event of respiratory failure. Downgraded event of 
epistaxis to non-fatal and updated listedness. Added treatment medications and details. Updated narrative 
appropriately. Update 29Ape39: Additional information received on 28Apr09 from study investigator. Updated 
cause of death. Added diagnostic testing and results. Updated narrative appropriately. Update 07.1u109: 
Information received on 06Jul09. Removed event of death from progressive disease as it was unrelated to study 
therapy, and updated narrative. Update 30-Nov-2009: Upon review, this case is being resubmitted due to a 
correction in the medical history E2B mapping.

001.114011. 1ung cancer diagnosed 28May09, peripheral vascular disease, right and left lower extremity arterial 
bypass '87, hypothooidism, and recent pneumonia. The patient received multiple concomitant medications 
Incitoding.fokc acid and vitamin B12. On 18.1Uri09, the patient first received pernetrexed disodiurn.(Alimta) 744 mg 
intravenously. (lv), in combination with  ..  '  ' e hydrochloride (Gemzar) 2232 mg IV. and in combination with 
bevaeizurnab 700 mg IV, ail for an unspecified frequency, for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer. Prior to 
the event, study.therapy was last received. on 1:0Sep09. On amidays since last receiving study 
therapy, the patient had fallen at home and was unable to get up. Emer . . Medical Services arrived at the 
patient's home and his oxygen saturations were in the 70's. The patient was transferred to the emergency 
department. At the time of arrival to the emergency department, the patient's oxygen saturation was in the 90's with 
a non-rebreather mask. The patient reported a two week history of chest congestion with symptoms increasing 
over the past three days. Labs showed sodium 127, potassium 3.9, chloride 91, blood urea nitrogen 15, creatinine 
0.8, glucose 90, calcium B.9, white blood cell count 25.4, hemoglobin 9.2, and platelet count 148. An 
electrocardiogram (ECG) showed sinus rhythm, nonspecific T-wave changes, which reflected electronic artifact and 
motion artifact. The patient was subsequelnot!. hgos la zed for grade 3 shortness of breath and weakness; the initial 
coneern was of. recurrent pneumonia. On an echocardiogram was performed and s .  systolic 
p[.:0 preserved, albeit, suggesting possib concentric left ventricular hypertrophy. On that same date, the 
patient. died. Cause of death was determined as pneumonia. It was unknown if the events of shortness of breath 
or weakness continued until the time of death. It was not provided if an autopsy was performed. The patient 
rem ..  on protocol until the time of death. In the opinion of the study investigator, the event of grade 3 shortness 
of breath and weakness, were not related to study therapy. It was also determined the cause of death, pneumonia, 
was unlikely rotated to pernetrexed, gemcitabine, or bevacizumab. Protocol procedure relatedness was not 
provided. This patient is cross referenced in case US  i  i   t  .005951. Update 050c.t09: Information received on 
020009. Added event of death, amended causality for the events of shortness of breath and weakness from yes 
to no, amended actiontaken for study drugs to discontinued, and updated narrative. Update 190ct09: additional 
information received 190ct09. ECHO results; cause of death; unlikely related to study therapy.
