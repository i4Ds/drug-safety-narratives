Spontaneous report from the USA by a consumer of a female with events of non-serious JC VIRUS INFECTION 
and TRIED BOTH HUMIRA AND CIMZIA WITH NO HELP with HUMIRA (ADALIMUMAB).
On unknown dates, the patient experienced JC VIRUS INFECTION and TRIED BOTH HUMIRA AND CIMZIA 
WITH NO HELP.  REMICADE (INFLIXIMAB RECOMBINANT) LYOPHILIZED POWDER (INFLIXIMAB), CIMZIA 
(CERTOLIZUMAB PEGOL) and TYSABRI (NATALIZUMAB) were also considered suspect.
Narrative from Janssen, reference number: US-JNJFOC-20140712974. 
This spontaneous report was received from a consumer or other non health professional via another company 
(UCB US Drug Safety Operations) and concerns a female patient of unspecified age from the United States; local 
case ID: 2014US0001611.
The patient's height, weight and medical history were not reported. The patient was treated with infliximab, 
recombinant (lyophilized powder, intravenous, batch unknown) unspecified dose and frequency, initiated on an 
unspecified date for an unspecified indication. Non-company suspect drug included adalimumab (unspecified, 
unknown) unspecified dose and frequency, initiated on an unspecified date for an unspecified indication, 
certolizumab pegol (unspecified, unknown) unspecified dose and frequency, initiated on an unspecified date for an 
unspecified indication; and natalizumab (unspecified, unknown) unspecified dose and frequency, initiated on an 
unspecified date for an unspecified indication. 
Concomitant medications were nor reported: It was reported that the patient had used infliximab for 6 years and it 
worked great for probably the first 4 years. The patient then tried both Humira (adalimumab) and Cimzia 
(certolizumab pegol) with no help.  The patient used Tysabri (natalizumab) and felt amazing but got the John 
Cunningham virus (JC virus infection) and so had to stop before she got Progressive multifocal 
leukoencephalopathy (PML). The patient did some bridge therapies while waiting. At the time of this report, a new 
drug was approved in the United States and the patient was hoping to start within the next month. Treatment with 
natalizumab was withdrawn and action taken with infliximab, recombinant, adalimumab and certolizumab pegol was
not reported. The outcome of JC virus infection was not reported.
This report was serious (medically significant).
No Relevant Test/Laboratory Data Reported.
