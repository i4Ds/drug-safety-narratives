This non-Lilly clinical trial case concerns a 70 year old female 
of unknown ethnicity. The patien s me Icahistory was not specified. Concomi ant medication was not reported 
On 17-Feb-2010, the patient first received intravenous pemetrexed 500mg/m2 (actual dose 955 mg) and oral 
pazopanib 800mg per day for the treatment of non-small cell carcinoma. Laboratory results performed two days 
before cycle 3 day 1 (01-Apr-2010) were as follows: haemoglobin 13.8, hematocrit 40.4, white blood cells 6.36, 
platelets 269,000, sodium 138, potassium 4.34, calcium 2.24, glucose 142, creatinine 0.6, total bilirubin 1, alanine 
aminotransferase 110, aspartate aminotransferase 68, gamma-glutamyltransferase 35, blood alkaline phosphatise 
62, international normalised ratio 0.9 and activated partial thromboplastin time 25. No units or reference ranges 
were provided. On 01-Apr-2010, the patient received the third cycle of pemetrexed and pazopanib. The patient's 
mean sitting blood pressure reading on this date was 140/82, heart rate 60 beats/min, temperature 36.3C. It was 
noted that the subject had lost 7kg since starting therapy with pemetrexed and pazopanib and 3kg since cycle 2 day 
1. On 1111111.1111.days after first receiving pemetrexed and pazopanib, the patient developed severe syncope 
which required hospitalisation. Treatment for syncope was not specified. The event resolved the same day oral 
MO although it was also reported that it required four days to get the patient to a stable condition. Therapy 
with pemetrexed and pazopanib was continued. Date of discharge from hospital was not provided. On 
111111days after first receiving pemetrexed and pazopanib and an unknown time after last receiving pemetrexed and 
pazopanib, the patient was re-adMitted to the hospital due to a grade 4 pneumonia. No laboratory data or details of 
corrective treatments were provided. The patient died on111111.11. Cause of death was reported as pneumonia, 
grade 5. It was unknown whether an autopsy was performed. No further details were provided. It was unknown if 
therapy with pemetrexed and pazopanib were continuing at the time of the patient's death. The investigator 
considered there was a reasonable possibility that the syncope may have been caused by pemetrexed and 
pazopanib. The investigator stated the syncope was due to fatigue after treatment with pemetrexed and pazopanib. 
The investigator also considered there was a reasonable possibility that the fatal event of pneumonia may have 
been caused by pemetrexed, but that it was unrelated to pazopanib. Relatedness against protocol procedures was 
not collected. Update 14-Mar-2011: Additional information received from the investigator via other manufacturer on 
10-Mar-2011. Changed cause of death to pneumonia, upgraded outcome to fatal, and changed relatedness for this 
event to related to pemetrexed and start date to 12-Apr-2010. Updated listendness for syncope. Narrative and 
relevant fields updated accordingly.
