Medically Significant
A neurologist reported that a 32 year old female patient on TYSABRI (300 mg, IV, QM) for Multiple Sclerosis from 
unknown date to unknown date experienced suspect PML (onset unknown).  The patient had received 
approximately 80 infusions of TYSABRI. MRI (date unknown) showed a large lesion in the brainstem. Lumbar 
puncture is scheduled. PLEX has been started. The event of suspect PML is ongoing. The causality for the event of
suspect PML is unknown.  It is unknown if TYSABRI treatment is ongoing.
Update 29 Jan 2015: Follow-up information received indicated the patient presented with trouble walking and 
weakness beginning a couple of weeks prior.  The patient received treatment with steroids and Acthar gel 
(adrenocorticotropic hormone) and was still recovering.  MRI performed within the last week showed a lesion in the 
brain stem. Lumbar puncture is pending. The patient has had 93 infusions of TYSABRI which is administered every
8 weeks.
Update 30 Jan 2015: Follow-up information included MRI images from 21 Jan 2015 (brain, brainstem, spine) and 
23 Jan 2015 (brain, brainstem).
Update 02 Feb 2015: Follow-up information received from a registered nurse further identified the patient via initials
and date of birth.  At the time of this report the TOUCH database indicated the patient received a total of 93 
infusions of TYSABRI from 04 Dec 2006 to 30 Dec 2014.  The patient first experienced symptoms of MS in Mar 
2003.  Previous MS therapy included Rebif (interferon beta-1a) and Betaseron (interferon beta-1b).  The patient 
had no immunosuppressant history. The patient was enrolled in (b) (6)  study. The patient was believed to be 
JCV antibody positive upon starting TYSABRI. JCV antibody status on 03 Oct 2014 was 2.9. On 08 Dec 2014, pt. 
experienced worsened difficulty walking, which the patient had noted had started about a month prior, but she had 
ignored. The patient was seen on 09 Dec 2014 and was experiencing difficulty walking and new weakness on right 
side, but no cognitive issues. At office visit, JCV antibody was drawn (index of 2.64) as well as anti-TYSABRI 
antibody test, which was negative. A MRI was performed that day, 09 Dec 2014, which showed no changes from 
previous MRI: no new lesions, but small brainstem lesion. The patient was thought to be having MS relapse and 
was given Solu-medrol (methylprednisolone) for 3 days (09 Dec 2014-11 Dec 2014).  The patient was seen on 20 
Dec 2014, still having weakness on right side, so TYSABRI was infused on 20 Dec 2014 (dose #93). On 21 Jan 
2015, follow-up MRI performed which showed the brainstem lesion had tripled in size (described as looking like a 
hot dog), no enhancement, +DWI. PLEX was immediately started the next day (22 Jan 2015) as an outpatient; 5 
PLEX sessions were administered in total with the last on 30 Jan 2015.  The patient was seen at the physician's 
office on 02 Feb 2015 still having right-sided weakness. JCV antibody test again drawn (results pending). Lumbar 
puncture was scheduled for 05 Feb 2015 and CSF JCV PCR will be sent to (b) (6)  for testing. The patient was still 
at home and stable.

Update 02 Feb 2015: Follow-up information received included MRI reports from 09 Dec 2014 and 21 Jan 2015.
Brain/brainstem MRI on 09 Dec 2014 (compared with 20 Nov 2014 scan) showed no interval change since prior 
scan although lesion load is high, it is chronic, and it's mainly periventricular white matter, the subcortical white 
matter, and brainstem. A particularly large plaque in the pons in the left side of the pons that is perpendicular to the 
axis of the pons. Moderate degree of brain atrophy, present previously, and mainly the fronto-parietal lobes and not 
the temporal lobes. There were no enhancing lesions, no new lesions, no diffusion abnormalities, and no evidence 
of PML. Brain/brainstem MRI on 21 Dec 2014 (compared to 09 Dec 2014 scan) showed continued chronic changes
of demyelinating disease including significant brain atrophy. A new lesion involving the left brainstem beginning at 
the lower pons and ascending up to the pons mid brain junction where it assumes complete effacement of the left 
side of the pons medullary junction. It ascends up the mid brain up into the lower diencephalon, which in retrospect 
was minimally involved before; this lesion is diffusion positive, but does not enhance with contrast. This either 
represents a worsening of MS lesion that is diffusion positive but does not enhance, or possibly a change 
consistent with PML which does not typically involve brainstem structures.
Update 05 Feb 2015: The prescribing neurologist reported, via a TOUCH Prescribing Program Discontinuation 
Questionnaire, that the patient, enrolled in a Biogen Idec sponsored program of Monitored Therapy, experienced 
PML. Since 10 Dec 2014 the patient tested positive for anti-JCV antibodies.
Update 10 Feb 2015: Follow-up information received included STRATIFY JCV antibody results.  JCV antibody 
testing on 22 Nov 2010 was detected (0.849 nOD-30) and JCV antibody testing on 21 Nov 2011 was detected 
(1.225 nOD-30).
Update 13 Feb 2015: The neurologist reported via a Biogen Idec employee that the CSF sample sent to (b) (6)  
was lost. No additional information was provided.
Update 17 Feb 2015: Follow-up information included MRI images provided for the following dates: 21 Jan 2015 
(spine and cervical), 21 Jan 2015 (brain/brainstem), 23 Jan 2015 (brain/brainstem), 05 Feb 2015, and 16 Feb 2015.
Update 18 Feb 2015: Follow-up information received included additional information regarding the patient's clinical 
course as well as MRI results. The patient had their 92nd TYSABRI infusion on 20 Nov 2014 and their 93rd on 30 
Dec 2014. JCV antibody index was 2.64 (positive) on 23 Dec 2014. The patient received SoluMedrol 
(methylprednisolone, 1 gram, IV) on 09, 10, and 11 Dec 2014, Acthar Gel (adrenocorticotropic hormone) on 06 Jan 
and 13 Jan 2015, Keppra (levetiracetam) for two seizures. The patient was admitted to the hospital (date not 
provided), had trouble swallowing and was not doing well. The patient received manitol 1g/kg for 5 days. The 
patient is currently doing much better, is now feeding herself and is more alert. Antiviral mefloquine may possibly be
tried. CSF sample drawn on 05 Feb 2015 did not reach the testing facility until 12 Feb 2015 for JCV DNA

ultrasensitive, quantitative, real-time PCR testing. CSF analysis on sample collected on 05 Feb 2015 showed RBC 
0-1, WBC 1, Segs 6%, Lymph 75%, Monocyte 19%, Glucose 53 mg/dl (reference range 40-75), Protein 37 mg/dl 
(reference range 15-45); the sample was clear and colorless with no xanthrochromia and fibrin was absent. MS 
panel, sample drawn 05 Feb 2015, showed myelin basic protein <2 mcg/l (reference 0.0-4.0) which was considered
negative, oligoclonal bands were present, >5 well definted gamma restriction bands which were considered 
supportive evidence of MS. JCV antibody index was 2.76 (positive) on 06 Feb 2015. Anti-TYSABRI antibody test on
16 Feb 2015 was negative.
MRI brain/brainstem on 20 Nov 2014 showed no interval change since the prior scan of a month ago. Lesion load is
large and chronic, location periventricular white matter of both hemispheres, also present in brainstem and 
subcortical white matter. No new lesions. No diffusion abnormalities and no evidence of PML. MRI brain/brainstem 
on 05 Feb 2015 showed no change. The lesion in the left brain stem is present but still does not enhance and is still
mildly diffusion positive. No new abnormalities seen in the brain. No new enhancing lesions or any new lesions 
seen. The brainstem lesion still shows no signs of enhancement. No significant interval change. The previously 
described brainstem Iesion still is non-enhancing but vaguely diffusion positive, no new areas of diffusion positivity. 
MRI brain/brainstem on 16 Feb 2015, FINDINGS: progressive lesion involving the left brainstem, stable between 
the February 5 and January 21 study though again shows significant increase in size now occupying nearly the 
entirety of the left brainstem and extending into the cerebral peduncle/corticospinal tracts and into the thalamus. 
For the most part, the diffusion-weighted imaging high signal is slightly bright on ADC map indicating this is not true 
restrictive diffusion. At the inferior aspect of the lesion in the lower midbrain near the pontine junction there may be 
some minimal low signal on the ADC map indicating true restricted signal. Regardless, increase in size indicates an
active MS plaque. There may be some mass effect with slight enlargement of the midbrain and cerebral peduncle. 
Additionally, there is greater extension of abnormal signal on FLAIR imaging in the right frontoparietal convexity 
around the central sulcus, also compatible with progressive disease. Finally, more signal is seen along the left 
vertex adjacent to the falx, again at the frontoparietal junction. None of these areas shows abnormal enhancement 
or restricted diffusion. Midline structures are within normal limits, No intracranial hemorrhage is seen. Conclusion: 
Progressive plaque compatible with MS flare. Areas of progression are in the large lesion of the left midbrain 
extending into the thalamus, right convexity in the frontoparietal region and in the left parafalcine vertex again in the
frontoparietal region. Frank mass effect in the left midbrain and cerebral peduncle is suspected. There is an 
association with PML, certainly possible and would depend upon detecting viral antigen.
Additionally, it was noted that the case update from 02 Feb 2015 incorrectly noted the MRI report date of 21 Dec 
2014, which is correctly 21 Jan 2015.
Update 20 Feb 2015: Follow-up information received clarified the CSF JCV DNA test performed on sample 
collected 05 Feb 2015 was by (b) (6)  Laboratory.

Update 12 Mar 2015: Biogen Idec considers this case high suspect for PML and final call based on positive MRI 
and CSF negative for JCV DNA.
Update 16 Mar 2015: Follow-up information was received from the patient's mother who reported the patient only 
has a few hours to live (NOS). Concomitant medications included Ampyra ER (fampridine), Detrol LA (tolterodine), 
stool softener (NOS), multi-vitamins (NOS), fish oil, cranberry capsule, Xanax (alprazolam), and baclofen. No 
further information was provided.
Update 15 May 2015: A report received from Acorda, Manufacturer's Report #US-ACORDA-ACO_109962_2015, 
indicates that a physician reported, via solicited source type, that the 32 year old female patient with MS 
experienced PML (onset Jan 2015; previously reported as 2014) for which the patient was hospitalized on an 
unspecified date. On an unspecified date, an abnormal brain MRI was consistent with PML.  Ampyra (fampridine) 
was started on an unspecified date in Jun-2010 at 10 mg every 12 hours orally for MS and was withdrawn on an 
unspecified date. The patient died due to PML on an unspecified date in (b) (6)  No autopsy was performed. The
reporter (physician) assessed the relationship between Ampyra and the event was not related. The physician 
assessed the causality as possibly related to TYSABRI (previously reported as related).
