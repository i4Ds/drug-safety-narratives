Case number# PHEH2015US002951, is a combined initial report received from a physician via a patient oriented 
program (Gilenya Go Program, POP ID: POP00002581) on 09 Feb 2015 and 12 Feb 2015.
This report refers to an adult female patient. Medical history included glaucoma. Concurrent conditions included 
beningn essential hypertension and diabetes mellitus. 
This polymedicated patient received Gilenya (fingolimod) capsule for the treatment of relapsing remitting multiple 
sclerosis from an unknown start date at a dose of 0.5 mg (oral). The patient also received Tecfidera (dimethyl 
fumarate) for the treatment of relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis from an unknown date in Oct 2013 at an 
unknown dose. 
On an unknown date (today), the patient experienced very fatigue. It was reported that, the patient balance was off 
(balance disorder). She had fallen recently and fallen this morning (fall). On an unknown date, the patient 
developed numbness (hypoaesthesia) and tingling (paraesthesia) that was constant. The patient could not taste 
things like she usually could (dysgeusia). The patient had cervical pain (neck pain) that was severe. The pain 
radiated in to her shoulder blades. The pain rate was 10/10. The lumabar pain (back pain) that radiated all through 
the lower back and the pain rate was 9.5/10. The patient experienced numbness, tingling in her shins down. The 
patient was not sleeping well as night/sleep disturbances (sleep disorder). 
On an unknown date, the patient was poorly feeling (malaise), headache, neck pain, neck stiffness 
(musculoskeletal stiffness), motor disturbances, sensory disturbance. The patient took Benadryl for pruritis. On 17 
Dec 2014, CMP (comprehensive metabolic panel) showed normal except for sodium which was 134 (normal value: 
135 to 146) (blood sodium decreased), chloride was 97 (normal value: 98 to 110) (blood chloride decreased), 
protein was 8.2 (normal range: 6.1 to 8.1) (protein total increased), globulin was 4.1 (normal range: 1.9 to 3.7) 
(globulins increased), CD4 was 488 (normal range: 490 to 1740). CBC showed normal except for hemoglobin 
which was 8.2 (normal range: 11.7 to 15.5) (haemoglobin decreased), hematocrit was 27.4 (normal range: 35.0 to 
45.0) (haematocrit decreased), MCV (mean cell volume) was 56.5 (normal range: 80 to 100) (mean cell volume 
decreased), MCH (mean corpuscular hemoglobin) was 17.0 (normal range: 27 to 33) (mean cell haemoglobin 
decreased), RDW (red cell distribution width) was 20.7 (normal range: 11.0 to 15.0) (red cell distribution width 
increased), JCV positive index was 0.74 (normal range and unit not provided) (JC virus test positive). 
On an unknown date, the patient had abnormal MRI brain (nuclear magnetic resonance imaging brain abnormal) 
and abnormal SSEPS (somatosensory evoked potentials abnormal) with fatigue, facial numbness and LUE 
numbness. On an unknown date, the MRI showed lesion were more. HNPs was c3 to T1. 
The patient developed bilateral ulnar neuropathies at the elbow (neuropathy peripheral) with L greater than right,

right CTS (Carpal tunnel syndrome). It was reported that, the surgery was pending.
 On an unknown date, the patient experienced fatgue, daytime drowsiness (somnolence), abnormal desaturations 
at night below 88 percentage with apnea (apnoea). On 11 Jan 2015, lab test showed abnormal MRI of the brain 
with and without paramagnetic contrast agent with 6 moderate and 21 small, scattered white matter lessions on the 
flair consistent with MS (Central nervous system lesion). 
On 12 Jan 2015, blood pressure was 160/102 mmHg (normal value and unit not provided) at sitting (03: 52 PM) 
(blood pressure increased). The neurological showed gait and station were normal including tandem, toe and heel 
walking but pain to soles of feet with walking in bare feet and peripheral neuropathy. The facial strength and 
sensation including corneal reflex was normal bilateral except 2 left side of face. The motor strength was normal 
and symmetric except 3 left brachioradialis reflex. The sensation was decreased to bilateral lower extremities with 
PN distribution and decreased in the four extremities except 3 LUE. The cervical spine motions were reduced 
minus 2 with extension, minus with right bilateral movement, nagative 2,3 with left left movement and nagative 2 
with flexion, The psp spasms was positive 2/ positive 3. Foraminal compression was positive on the left and 
negative on the right. The bilateral lower extremities calf was cramping (muscle spasms). No edema, no hair 
growth to toes and the pedal pulses was positive 4/5 bilaterally.  The patient prefers to be off Tecfidera and retry 
Gilenya which worked well for her. Action taken with  Gilenya and Tecfidera was unknown. 
The outcome of the events was reported as unknown. The seriousness and causality of the events were not 
reported. Seriousness assessment of event apnoea was upgraded based on the NVS IME list. Seriousness 
assessment of events central nervous system lesion was upgraded based on information available in the source 
document.
