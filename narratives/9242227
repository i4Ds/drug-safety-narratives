This is a report from a Non-Interventional Study Source for protocol Subject ID An 8-year-old 
Caucasian female subject started to receive oral 'sertraline hydrochloride 6.25 mg every mr orniinggil  ollit 13Mar2013, 
which was increased to 12.5 mg every morning on 04Apr2013 and stopped on 14Apr2013 for Generalised anxiety

(BENADRYL) as needed for rash from 09Apr2013 to 12Apr2013; and ongoing melatonin as needed (PRN) for

agitation and remains hospitalized. Per principle investigator (Pi's) note from appointment on 23Apr2013, on 
25Mar2013, the subject had endoscopy/colonoscopy, all within normal range. On 26Mar2013, the subject continued 
on 6.25 mg sertraline and hyoscyamine was listed as a new medicine. On 28Mar2013, the subject developed 
nausea, vomiting and diarrhea (NN/D) and was hospitalized 111.11111.1tollillinDuring hospital stay, 
developed odd rash on her back (pityriasis rosea like). During the hospital she was on hyoscyamine, 
diphenhydramine, ondansetron, paracetamol (TYLENOL), and sertraline. Sucralfate was stopped on subject's 
request. On April 4 or April 5, sertraline was increased to 12.5 mg. She continued on hyoscyamine and 
ondansetron. The rash continued, mom noticed twitching of muscles and subject complained of a headache (HA), 
Due to rash, mom gave her approximately 20 mg of diphenhydramine from 09Apr2013 to 12Apr2013 after 
discharge from hospital. Due to stomach cramps, the subject often took hyoscyamine twice per day. The subject 
also completed therapy (RX) of nitazoxanide on 12Apr2013. On Saturday, 13Apr2013, the subject was at a 
modeling audition and was acting sleepy, and mom thought that child was just being rude. The subject then had to 
fill out a paper and complained of not being able to see. Mom noticed that child was out of sorts. Audition people 
wanted both girls who were auditioning, but mom said that they could only afford her sister, and not subject, which

grandmother she was having stomachaches, and she was given hyoscyamine. Of note, hyoscyamine contained a 
warning that it may cause blurry vision, and the subject saw this on the hyoscyamine bottle and voiced concern to 
grandmother, but was given the medicine anyway. She woke up with hugely dilated pupils. She was quite agitated 
so was taken to the hospital. Doctors there called it serotonin syndrome although mom questioned diagnosis. The 
subject was agitated, delirious, seeing bugs, and was put on a versed drip but remained combative. The next day, 
subject was beet red and had a very dry mouth. They checked the half-life of the sertraline, which if the subject was 
experiencing serotonin syndrome, would mean that the medication would have been out of her system while the 
symptoms were persisting. As soon as the versed level was decreased, she became very combative, saying things 
such as 'don't get near me' mom said that she was acting like she was possessed. After 30 hours, she could still 
not see or walk. A psychiatric advanced registered nurse practitioner (ARNP) overheard and said that she thought it 
was not serotonin syndrome. Hospitalist was very reluctant to bring psychiatry in mom had to make demand. The 
ARNP agreed with brain scan, and suggested bipolar risk (activation side effect), she also prescribed risperidone. 
On 17Apr2013, subject was throwing up and had diarrhea. Subject was still taking hyoscyamine, and was given 
promethazine (PHENERGAN) for nausea 2-3 days in hospital. Also given diphenhydramine in hospital. Sight in one 
eye was still impaired and she was still twitching. An optometrist and ophthalmologist was recommended to assess 
vision. Since discharge, stomach had been better. She was reported to have severe lactose intolerance. Vision was 
better but still had difficulty seeing out of left eye. Mom was unable to have her seen yet by ophthalmology. The 
subject was mood stable but perhaps more anxious. Eating was okay on lactose free diet. The subject still had 
mpruritus,i co.mplained of leg itching. Anticholinergic toxicity was reported as new serious event with the onset date of a s it resulted in hospitalization. Relevant tests included electrokardiogram (EKG) on 
showing QTC calculation high 0.463s (normal range 0.36s-0.44s) with comments of borderline prolirri QiT; Lab 
tests on showing elevated platelet (PLT) 462000 units/ul (normal range 150000-400000), Segs 56.2 %, 
Low Lyrirlilli creatinine showing 0.64 mg/dL (normal range 0.70-1.50) with comments of Low; blood urea 
nitrogen (BUN) showing 25 mgldL (normal range 6-19); creatinine on an unknown date with no results provided. 
The doctor did not diagnosis the subject with serotonin syndrome. Hyoscyamine was ordered by hospital on 
16Apr2013 at 0.125 mg half tablet every 6 hours (as needed) for abdominal pain. Sertraline 25 mg oral tablet, 0.5 
tablet, lx daily was withdrawn permanently on 14Apr201.3. Hyoscyamine was later withdrawn permanently on 
23Apr2013. Treatment for anticholinergic toxicity included doctor suggested to discontinue hyoscyamine on 
23Apr2013. The outcome of the SAEs nausea, vomiting and diarrhea was recovered on 04Apr2013. The outcome 
of the SAEs anticholinergic toxicity; severe agitation and mental status changes was recovered on OM and 
discharged from hospital, The subject was stable. Odd rash on back (pityriasis), twitching of muscles, headache,

red, dry mouth, delirious, seeing bugs, combative, acting like she was possessed, inability to see/walk, throwing up, 
diarrhea, twitching, lactose intolerance, anxiousness, pruritus and leg itching were not considered as SAE; rather, 
adverse events associated with the SAEs anticholinergic toxicity, mental status changes, severe agitation and
