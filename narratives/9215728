A neurologist reported that an unknown aged female patient on TYSABRI (300 mg, IV, QM) for Multiple Sclerosis 
from 2009 to 20 Dec 2012 for 44 infusions experienced suspected PML (onset unknown). The patient was first 
diagnosed with MS in 2009 after experiencing many relapses prior to her diagnosis. TYSABRI was initiated as her 
first line therapy. The patient experienced a relapse (onset unknown) while on TYSABRI therapy and an MRI (date 
not provided) revealed gadolinium enhancement activity with brain stem and pons involvement. TYSABRI was 
discontinued due to lack of efficacy (onset unknown). The physician evaluated the patient on 15 Jan 2013 and she 
had developed abducens palsy (double vision) and had an EDSS of 3 with a brainstem score of 3. Treatment 
included initiating Rituximab therapy on 23 Jan 2013. Approximately one month ago, the patient started to "behave 
strangely", and experienced difficulties swallowing and speaking. At that point, PML was suspected. On 18 Mar 
2013, the patient underwent a brain MRI which showed worsened lesions that were less distinct. The external 
neuroradiologist felt it could be PML, while another interpretation of the images stated it looked like possible IRIS. A

lumbar puncture was performed (Mar 2013) and a CSF sample sent to (b) (6)  on 19 Mar 2013 for testing (presumed 
JCV DNA). The patient has previously tested JCV antibody positive (date unknown). Causality was not assessed 
for any of the events. The patient has not recovered from suspect PML; outcome is unknown for possible IRIS, MS 
relapse, and TYSABRI ineffective. TYSABRI therapy remains discontinued.
Additional information is expected. 
Update  28 Mar 2013: A nurse reported that the patient was hospitalized. The nurse also reported that the patient's 
condition was not very good (not specified) and that the MRI pictures showed changes in the brainstem. CSF had 
been withdrawn from the patient and sent to SMI for testing for JCV DNA. The tests had returned negative while the
Hospitals own lab had found JCV DNA (not specified). CSF had also been sent to the US for testing and 
confirmation of JCV DNA. The nurse also reported that the patient was suffering from severe IRIS. The following 
MRI results were received:  27 May (assumed 2009) a cervical spine MRI was conducted to for suspected disc 
herniation and it revealed a 6 mm large area of edema in medullas near right range of C3 level. Position is 
consistent with demyelinating disease. A brain MRI was recommended. On 17 Jun 2009 MRI of brain revealed 
multiple different sized white matter changes both as in depth white matter as above with looks well consistent with 
demyelinating disease. on 02 Oct 2012 revealed a complete regression of previous  survey 17 Jun 2009 described 
large lesions with surounding edema. Creation of a weak charged lesion subcortical on the left side and small non-
charged lesions in the center semiovale. On 17 Dec 2012 an MRI revealed new MS plaques and also damage to 
the barrier of them. on 18 Mar 2013 an MRI revealed very widespread changes partially progressed compared to 
17 Dec 2012 and where to come a confluent white matter change temporally right side with central substance 
defect. PML should  be suspected.
Update 05 Apr 2013:A  physician reported through an  Area Business Manager, that  the patient had improved. The
patient was sitting in a wheel chair. The patient had difficulties talking and could not swallow. The patient had 
double vision. According to the reporting physician no PLEX had been performed on the patient. The reporting 
physician reported that the reaction may be an IRIS reaction due to the discontinuation of Tysabri in Dec 2012. The 
IRIS would have manifested in the brain stem. The patient was  treated with Solumedrol (methylprednsiolone 
sodium succinate).
Update 10 Apr 2013:The treating physician reported the patient has a confirmed PML. The tests showed positive 
PCR for JCV both from the (b) (6)  and the hospitals own lab.
Update 16 Apr 2013:Further clarification was received  and reported the following: The patient underwent 2 lumbar 
punctures; the first returned CSF JCV PCR negative from SMI, but positive with lowest copy number (50 st/ml) from
the local lab. A second LP for CSF JCV PCR testing was obtained a week later and returned positive from both SMI
and the local lab. This LP was performed after a pulse of cortisone for suspected IRIS. A 3rd LP is planned for 18

Biogen Idec the case is confirmed PML based on the positive CSF, MRI findings, and clinical symptoms.
Update 24 Apr 2013: Additional information was received from the neurologist via a MS Standardized PML Data 
Collection Tool. The neurologist assessed the patient's estimated Karnofsky and EDSS scores in 2009 to be 100 
(normal, no complaints; no evidence of disease) and 0 and the estimated EDSS in Jul 2009 to be 0. The patient 
was tested for anti-JCV antibody status with results reported as negative in 2011 and positive on 08 Dec 2011. On 
08 Dec 2011 the patient tested negative for anti-natalizumab antibodies. The neurologist assessed the patient's 
estimated Karnofsky score on (b) (6)  to be 100. On (b) (6)  the patient had an MRI (result not 
reported). On (b) (6)  the patient underwent a lumbar puncture with results reported as positive CSF JCV 
DNA of  50 copies per/mL and the neurologist assessed the patient's estimated Karnofsky and EDSS scores to be 
60 (requires occasional assistance, but is able to care for most of personal needs) and 4.5. On (b) (6)  the 
patient underwent a lumbar puncture with results reported as positive at 50 copies per/mL (local lab) and 630 
copies per/mL (SMI lab). A blood JCV DNA test revealed positive results at 80 copies/ml on (b) (6)  and 
positive results at 214 copies per/mL on (b) (6)  At the time of this report, the patient was in the hospital. It is 
unknown if the patient recovered from PML. Causality was assessed as related.
Update 24 Apr 2013;The neurologist reported via an Biogen Idec company representative,  the patient was given 
one dose of rituximab (Mabthera) (500 mg; unspecifed reason) on 23 Jan 2013.
Update 04 Jun 2013: The Swedish Regulatory Agency reported the 45 year old patient had been on TYSABRI
since 15 Jul 2009. The patient initially tested negative for JCV, but repeat test on 08 Dec 2011 was positive for JCV 
antibody. The patient developed clinical symptoms of brain stem relapse in Oct / Nov 2012 and double vision. A 
new MRI in Dec 2012 showed several high signaling changes in pons upper part of medulla oblongatae. When 
contrast was added, changes are shown dorsally in pons and a few changes periventricular on the left side. Also 
two high signaling 0.5 cm changes where shown juxacortical in right temporal lobe (compared to examnination 
performed on 10 Feb 2012). Considering the patient brain stem relapse, MRI findings and the fact that the patient 
was JCV antibody positive (patient had received 44 infusions of Tysabri), it was decided in in Jan 2013 that the 
patient would discontinue Tysabri treatment to be replaced by Mabthera (rituximab). The patient was given 1000 
mg "Tysabri" [most likely a typo; presumed Mabthera] on 23 Jan 2013. The last Tysabri infusion was given on 21 
Dec 2012. In Feb/Mar 2013 the patient developed further symptoms described as difficulty swallowing, speech 
impairment, general fatigue, difficulty walking and weakness of left leg. A new MRI was performed on 13 Mar 2013 
which showed progress of changes, specifically in the right temporal lobe where PML could not be excluded. An LP
was performed on 19 Mar 2013 with PCR for JCV in CSF which was negative (lower limit for detection: 50 copies). 
A new LP with PCR for JCV was performed on 28 Mar 2013 which was positive at 680 copies/mL (discrepant copy 
number from prior report of 630). The case was judged as PML with IRIS and the patient was treated with IV methyl

prednisolone. The patient has had slow regress of symptoms but has not recovered at report date.
Update 27 Jun 2013: Additional information was received from the treating physician who reported that the last 
PCR of CSF was JC Virus negative (date of testing not reported). An MRI performed on an unspecified date 
showed "progress" and possible prolonged IRIS.
Update 13 Aug 2013: Additional information received from a registered nurse reported that the patient had lumbar 
punctures for CSF samples on the 08 Jul 2013 and 18 Jul 2013. Results were not reported.
Update 06 Dec 2013: Additional information was received from the neurologist via a MS Standardized PML Data 
Collection Tool. The patient is alive, residing in a rehabilitation facility, and is currently on rituximab (started 23 Jan 
2013) for MS therapy. The neurologist assessed the patient's estimated Karnofsky score on 03 Dec 2013 and 
estimated EDSS score on 04 Dec 2013 to be 50 (requires considerable assistance and frequent medical care) and 
6.5. On 02 Dec 2013, the CD4 result was 0.79 (reference range 0.3 to 1.4). A brain MRI was done on 14 Oct 2013 
(results not provided).  On 16 Sep 2013, a lumbar puncture was performed with CSF JCV DNA result reported as 
positive at 19 copies / mL. A repeat lumbar puncture was performed on 04 Dec 2013 and the results were not yet 
analyzed. The patient was diagnosed with IRIS based on clinical symptoms and MRI findings. Cognitive, behavioral,
and multifocal motor (tetraparesis most affected left side) symptoms began on 29 Apr 2013. Speech (dysphagia, 
dysarthria), visual (diplopia), cerebellar (tetraataxi), and multifocal seizure (generalized epileptic seizures) 
symptoms began on an unspecified date. Treatment included Solumedrol "1g, IV, 1x1" and prednisolone tapered 
dose. The outcome of the patient's PML was unknown. The patient had recovered from IRIS. Causality for both 
events was assessed as related to TYSABRI.
Update 22 Apr 2014: Additional information was received from the neurologist via a MS Standardized PML Data 
Collection Tool. The patient is alive, residing at home, and is currently on rituximab for MS therapy. The neurologist 
assessed the patient's estimated Karnofsky and EDSS scores on 15 Apr 2014 to be 60 (requires occasional 
assistance, but is able to care for most of her personal needs) and 6.5. On 15 Apr 2014 , a brain MRI was 
performed (results not provided). A lumbar puncture was also performed and was negative for CSF JCV DNA (test 
date 18 Apr 2014). The outcome for the event of PML was not reported and the patient has not recovered from IRIS
(discrepant from previous report). Causality for the events was assessed as related to TYSABRI.
Update 30 Oct 2014 : The physician spontaneously reported that the patient has not had any MS treatment since 
the event and has not had any new lesions or relapses during this period.

http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jns.2015.04.010. The authors presented the case of a 42-year-old woman was diagnosed
with MS in the summer of 2009. She presented with a high lesion load on brain MRI and a rather severe disease 
course, which led to the initiation of natalizumab treatment in July 2009. No clinical relapses were recorded during 
the following years. In Dec 2011, the patient's JC virus serostatus converted to positive (Stratify JCV, (b) (6)  
). Brain MRI performed on 10 Feb 2012 (images provided) did not show any lesions suggestive of 
active MS inflammation or PML; natalizumab treatment was continued. In Nov 2012, after having received 43 
infusions of natalizumab, she experienced double vision. The clinical examination showed left abducens nerve 
palsy, and a new brain MRI on 17 Dec 2012 demonstrated multifocal new subcortical T2 lesions in the right parietal 
and temporal lobes. In addition, new small focal lesions were observed in the pons and mesencephalon; some of 
these lesions showed subtle contrast enhancement (images provided). At that time, PML was not suspected 
because of the origin of the clinical relapse and the lack of progressive neurological deterioration. The event was 
misinterpreted as breakthrough MS disease activity, and natalizumab treatment was switched (last infusion Dec 
2012) to rituximab. The patient received a single infusion of rituximab 1000 mg (previously reported as 500mg) IV in
Jan 2013. Thereafter, the CD19 and CD20 count (b0.01  109/L) remained at undetectable levels for the next 15 
months. In Mar 2013, the patient rapidly deteriorated. She experienced dysphagia, dysarthria, walking difficulties, 
and severe anxiety. Brain MRI on 18 Mar 2013 showed progression of the earlier described lesions (images 
provided). In particular, the lesions in the temporal and parietal lobes became confluent. New small `satellite 
lesions  highly suggestive of PML were identified. However, two separate subsequent PCRs for JCV DNA in CSF 
were negative, as described in other natalizumab-associated PML cases. At admission to a tertiary neurology 
department, the patient's condition had progressed further (EDSS 7.5). PML with an immune reconstitution 
inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) was suspected, and methylprednisolone (1000 mg i.v. daily for 3 days) was 
administered. A new lumbar puncture and qPCR for JCV showed 630 copies/mL (Laboratory of molecular medicine
and neuroscience/NINDS), and a diagnosis of definite PML according to the AAN criteria was confirmed. JCV DNA 
PCR in Jun 2013 showed 100 [copies/ml]. Sequential qPCR showed a low number of copies (13 19/mL) in CSF. 
No JCV DNA had been detected since December 2013. The patient slowly recovered without any clinical or MRI 
signs of new MS activity. The severity and course of PML was followed by repeated analysis of CSF biomarkers of 
axonal damage and astrogliosis. At 21 months after the PML diagnosis, the patient is able to walk short distances 
with bilateral support (EDSS 6.5), is dependent on some support but takes care of most daily activities, and is still 
without any disease-modifying therapy.
Update 28 May 2015: Additional information was received from the neurologist via a MS Standardized PML Data 
Collection Tool. The patient is alive, residing at home, and is currently not on any therapy for Multiple Sclerosis. The
neurologist assessed the patient's estimated Karnofsky and EDSS scores on 21 May 2015 to be 60 (requires 
occasional assistance, but is able to care for most of her personal needs) and 6.5. On 25 May 2015, a brain MRI 
was performed (results not provided). The outcome for the event of PML was reported as not recovered as of 21 
May 2015. The patient has recovered from IRIS as of 02 Dec 2013.  Causality for the events was assessed as

related to TYSABRI.
Update 01 Jun 2015: Follow-up received from the Swedish Regulatory Agency (#MPA 131834) considered the 
event of PML in this 45 year old woman as life-threatening and probably related. The patient had been treated with 
TYSABRI for three years. TYSABRI was not reinstated. Note: CIOMS noted that the patient was pregnant (to be 
clarified). Note: CIOMS noted that the patient was pregnant (to be clarified).
Update 10 Jun 2015: Follow-up information received from the original reporting neurologist confirmed that the 
patient was not pregnant.
Update 02 Oct 2015 : Additional information obtained from the Swedish IMSE 1 register indicated that PML was 
suspected on 31 Oct 2012 (discrepant from previous reported date of Dec 2012). TYSABRI was discontinued on 19
Dec 2012 (previously reported as 20 Dec 2012). JCV antibody tests performed on 08 Dec 2011 and 11 Dec 2012 
were positive. JCV PCR liquor test from 19 Mar 2013 was negative. A JCV PCR liquor test was also performed on 
28 Mar 2013 however results from the test were unknown.
