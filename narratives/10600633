Medically Significant
A neurologist spontaneously reported that a 55 year old female patient on TYSABRI (300 mg, IV, QM) for relapsing 
remitting Multiple Sclerosis from unknown date to unknown date, total treatment length about 3 years, came under 
suspicion for progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) characterized by dysarthria (onset 18 Sep 2014).
The patient tested positive for anti-JCV antibodies on an unknown date.  No treatment was reported.  The outcome 
for the event PML suspicion characterized by dysarthria is unknown. The causality for the event of PML suspicion 
characterized by dysarthria is unknown.  TYSABRI therapy was stopped temporarily.
Update 25 Sep 2014:  The neurologist provided the following additional information.  The patient had a lumbar 
puncture (LP) on 19 Sep 2014 and the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was negative for JCV DNA per (b) (6)

(b) (6)  (lower level of detection 50 copies/ mL).  An MRI from 22 Sep 2014 showed no new lesions.
Update 09 Oct 2014:  Additional information was provided by the neurologist after consultation with another 
physician. The other physician believes that the lesion is a possible thalamic PML lesion.  A new MRI will be 
planned quickly and a new PL [lumbar puncture] also.  The physician has been advised to send the new sample for 
JCV PCR to (b) (6)  as the previous sample tested at (b) (6)  was negative. At the time of this report, the patient 
was clinically stable but dysarthria symptom was present.
Update 13 Oct 2014: Additional information was provided by the neurologist via a Biogen Idec Employee (medical 
liaison manager) on a (b) (6)  sample identification form. CSF sample has been sent for JCV PCR testing (results 
pending).  The female patient on TYSABRI from an unknown date to end of Jul [2014] for MS was being evaluated 
for possible PML characterized by dysarthria. MRI (unknown date) showed a new thalamic lesion on left side.  CSF 
analysis on 19 Sep 2014 was negative (reported previously).
Update 22 Oct 2014: Additional information was provided by a medical liaison manager. A new PL [lumbar 
puncture] was done and the samples were sent to (b) (6)  and (b) (6)  both results were negative (dates not 
provided). A new MRI is planned today. No other information was provided.
Update 23 Oct 2014: Additional information was provided by a medical liaison manager. It was clarified that two 
lumbar punctures were performed, one on 19 Sep 2014 and one on 13 Oct 2014.  Results of the samples from both
dates were negative at (b) (6)   Sample from 13 Oct 2014 also tested negative at(b) (6)   It was clarified that the 
sample from 19 Sep 2014 was not tested at (b) (6)   A MRI performed yesterday [22 Oct 2014] showed a little 
progression of the lesion.  A new MRI is planned for next month. At the time of this report, the patient is clinically 
stable.  No further information was provided.
Update 10 Nov 2014: Additional information was received from the neurologist via a Biogen Idec Employee 
(medical liaison manager) on a (b) (6)  sample identification form. CSF sample was collected on 10 Nov 2014.  The 
patient had been taking TYSABRI for 4 years until the end of Jul [2014].  PML was noted as highly probable in this 
patient. The patient presented with dysarthria the end of Jul [2014] and right hemiparesia in Nov [2014].  Previous 
CSF JCV PCR analysis was negative.  MRI on unknown date showed left thalamic and parietal progressive lesion.
Update 11 Nov 2014:  Additional information was provided by the neurologist via a Biogen Idec Employee (medical 
liaison manager).  The patient is not doing well.  The lesion was evaluated by another physician at the (b) (6)  and 
was assessed as highly suspect. A third lumbar puncture was done on 10 Nov [2014] and samples have been sent 
to (b) (6)

Update 14 Nov 2014:  Additional information was provided by the neurologist via a Biogen Idec Employee (medical 
liaison manager).  PCR result of the sample collected from the third lumbar puncture and sent to (b) (6)  was also 
negative. MRI on an unknown date showed a highly suspect atypical lesion and MRI done on 12 Nov [2014] 
showed enhancement of the lesion.  Treatment included corticosteroids (NOS) since 11 Nov 2014.  The patient has
slightly improved.  No further information was provided.
Update 09 Dec 2014:  Additional information was provided by a medical liaison manager.  The patient has slightly 
improved but has high disability. Patient was still being treated with corticosteroids (NOS).  The treating physician 
will try to treat the patient with maraviroc. As the patient has suffered a lot, a brain biopsy and another PL [lumbar 
puncture] will not be performed at this time.
Update 07 Jan 2015:  Additional information was received from the neurologist via a Biogen Idec Employee 
(medical liaison manager).  The patient is clinically doing better and is now treated with maraviroc. It was reported 
that the patient developed IRIS on 10 Nov 2014. Additional testing of the same CSF aliquot drawn on 10 Nov 2014 
revealed positive JCV serology on LCR (ligase chain reaction) (tested at (b) (6)  on 02 Dec [2014]). MRI scans 
are expected. No further information was provided.
Update 12 Feb 2015: Additional information was received from the neurologist via a Biogen Idec Employee 
(medical liaison manager).  The patient was doing slightly better - she could now eat on her own and her speech 
has improved.
Update 06 Mar 2015: Additional information was received from the neurologist via a Biogen Employee (medical 
science liaison). The patient had slightly improved but had some disabilities described as wheelchair [-bound], 
could not walk more than 20m without assistance, and improved dysarthria, but still present. Last MRI (date 
unknown) showed less enhancing and less extended lesion.
Update 09 Mar 2015: All available MR images for the patient from 13 Feb 2014, 22 Jul 2014, 22 Sep 2014, 22 Oct 
2014, 12 Nov 2014, 28 Nov 2014, 16 Dec 2014, 05 Jan 2015, and 02 Feb 2015 were uploaded to the high suspect 
cases folder in LifeIMAGE (MRI reports not provided; results of MRIs on 22 Sep 2014, 22 Oct 2014, and 12 Nov 
2014 were previously reported).
Update 09 Mar 2015:  Additional information was received from the neurologist via a MS PML Data Collection 
Form: Suspect.  The patient on TYSABRI from 2009 to 24 Jul 2014 (therapy was not interrupted for greater than 3 
months) was being evaluated for PML due to clinical signs and symptoms which prompted MRI which revealed 
suspicious findings.  The patient was currently in a rehabilitation facility. The patient was diagnosed with MS in 
2000.  MS disease symptoms prior to suspected PML included cerebellar (NOS) (onset unknown). The patient has

never received prior immunosuppressant therapy; however, immunomodulatory therapy included Avonex for RRS 
(presume RRMS) from 2002 to 2009.  Signs and symptoms which led to the evaluation for possible PML included 
speech (NOS) (onset unknown).  The following lumbar punctures were performed:  on 19 Sep 2014 - CSF JCV 
DNA result was negative at (b) (6) on 13 Oct 2014 - CSF JCV DNA results were negative at (b) (6)  and (b) (6)  
and on 10 Nov 2014 - CSF JCV DNA result was negative at (b) (6)  (all previously reported).  The patient tested 
positive for serum anti-JCV antibody on the following dates at (b) (6)  18 Jul 2013 with an index value of 2.550; 03 
Apr 2014 with an index value of 2.964, and 13 Oct 2014 with an index value of 3.447.   A brain biopsy was not 
performed. Test results prior to starting TYSABRI on 28 Feb 2008 included the following:  leukocyte count of 4.42 
(1000/mm3) (normal range 3.9-9.5), lymphocyte count of 30.2% (normal range 20-40%), and an absolute 
lymphocyte count of 1.33 (1000/mm3) (normal range 1.5-4.0).  Test results on TYSABRI prior to PML suspicion on 
30 May 2014 included the following: leukocyte count of 7.56 (1000/mm3), lymphocyte count of 46.4%, and an 
absolute lymphocyte count of 3.51 (1000/mm3).  Test results at the time of PML suspicion on 11 Nov 2014 included
the following: leukocyte count of 7.35 (1000/mm3), lymphocyte count of 10.4%, and absolute lymphocyte count of 
0.77 (1000/mm3).  CSF analyses were normal on 19 Sep 2014 and 13 Oct 2014 and abnormal (NOS) on 10 Nov 
2014.  The patient has not been treated with plasma exchange (PLEX) or immunoadsorption (IA).  PML treatment 
included mirtazapine, corticosteroids (NOS), maraviroc, and Keppra (levetiracetam).  The patient has never been 
and is not currently enrolled in a Biogen Idec Clinical Trial or non-Biogen Idec Clinical Trial. The event of PML 
suspicion is ongoing. PML suspicion had not been ruled out. Copaxone (glatiramer) was listed as treatment for the 
final diagnosis (which has not been provided at the time of this report; presume that patient has started on 
Copaxone for RRMS). The causality of the event PML suspicion in relation to TYSABRI was assessed as related.
TYSABRI therapy was stopped on 24 Jul 2014.
Update 12 Mar 2015: Upon internal review, Biogen considers this case high suspect and final call for PML based on
positive MRI but negative CSF.  This case will be closed and no additional follow-up is expected.
Update 15 Jul 2015: Additional information provided via a company representative indicated that the patient was 
doing better.  The patient had some disability, weakness in the legs.  Last MRI in Jun [2015] showed a slightly 
enhanced lesion.  The patient is now treated with glatiramer acetate.
