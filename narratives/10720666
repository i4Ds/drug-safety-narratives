AER 1522683 is an interventional case, received on 16/Dec/2014 from a physician and concerns a 65 years old 
male patient (patient number:(b) (6) ) who experienced progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy while enrolled in 
study (b) (6)
(b) (6)
The patient past medical history included progressive lymphoma, myocardial infarction, transient ischemic attack, 
cerebrovascular disease, cerebral thrombosis. Concurrent conditions included diabetes, hypertension, ischemic 
heart disease, joint pain, vascular disease. He received influenza vaccination. Concomitant medication included 
simvastatin, metformin, bisoprolol fumarate, dipyridamole, ramipril, paracetamol, aspirin. Past drugs were not 
reported.
On 23/Dec/2008, the patient was randomised to (b) (6)  started intravenous rituximab infusion a total dose of 650 
mg once, oral cyclophosphamide at a daily dose of  450 mg for three days (form not reported) and oral fludarabine 
at a daily dose of 70 mg for three days (form not reported). On 16/Mar/2009, he stopped the therapy with 
cyclophosphamide and fludarabine. On 14/May/2009, he received the last treatment (cycle six) prior to SAE. In 
Aug/2011, he was diagnosed with grade 3 progressive multifocal leucoencephalopathy which was due to JC virus 
infection, which resulted in significant disability. He was not hospitalised due to his condition. On 18/Oct/2011, he 
underwent magnetic resonance imaging scan (MRI) which revealed abnormal signal crossing or lesion of left 
occipital lobe. On 20/Oct/2011, a lumbar puncture was performed and JC virus detected. On 04/Nov/2011, the final 
diagnosis confirmed progressive multifocal leucoencephalopathy. 
At the time this report, outcome of the event progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy was persisting. 
The physician assessed the causal relationship of the event progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy as 
probably related with rituximab and unlikely related to fludarabine and cyclophosphamide.
 No further information was provided.
