Medically Significant
A neurologist spontaneously reported that a  46 year old female patient on TYSABRI (300 mg, IV, QM) for relapsing
remitting Multiple Sclerosis from Jun 2010 to 16 Dec 2013 experienced suspect PML (progressive multifocal 
leukoencephalopathy) (onset Jan 2014).  Approximately 20 days prior to reporting the patient presented with 
auditory hallucination. The event did not require hospitalisation. A lumbar puncture was scheduled for 04 Feb 2014 
and CSF samples was to be sent for JCV analysis. The patient had received 37 TYSABRI infusions at the time of 
event onset. The outcome for the event suspect PML is unknown. The causality for the event of suspect PML is 
unknown.  TYSABRI therapy was discontinued.
Update 03 Feb 2014: Additional information was received from the neurologist. Per clinical report: the patient's MS 
onset was in 1990 with right eye optic neuritis and oral fissure deviation. A MRI showed a demyelinating 
leukoencephalopathy while a CSF test resulted negative. Previous MS medication included IFN beta 1 a therapy 
(presumed AVONEX) due to several clinical relapses (onsets Apr 1999) which was discontinued in Apr 2000 due to
both clinical and neuroradiologic inefficacy. She received glatiramer acetate therapy from Oct 2002 due to several 
clinical relapses (onset 2001-2002) and discontinued in Sep 2004 due to both clinical and radiologic inefficacy. In 
Oct 2004 she started azathioprine therapy, discontinued in June 2005 due to persistent clinical and radiologic 
activity. In Jul 2005 the patient received the first mitoxantrone infusion to an unknown date. In Apr 2006 glatiramer 
acetate therapy was resumed due to the clinical and radiological stabilization gained with mitoxantrone therapy (6 
infusions, cumulative total dose 48 mg/mq). Glatiramer acetate therapy was discontinued in July 2010 due to 
clinical and radiological activity (lesion burden increase and lesions in active phase). The patient was switched to 
TYSABRI in Aug 2010 which led to EDSS score and MRI picture stabilization. On 23 Mar 2011 the patient tested 
positive for JCV Abs detection. In July 2011 she underwent a cortisone cycle due to a clinical worsening (presume 
of MS) featured by a significant fatigue (onset unknown; presume Jul 2011, outcome and causality not reported). 
An MRI on 26 Sep 2013 showed a stable lesional burden without lesions in active phase.
 In Jan 2014 the patient presented a likely epileptic episode, featured by auditory hallucination (she reported she 
heard a kind of hurricane noise) followed by disorientation for some hours. A neurological examination on 29 Jan 
2014 noted: well performed the "stretch arms" and "finger to nose" tests; the patient can lift up her right lower limb 
in 40 degrees, the left one in 5-10 degrees, the left heel-knee test was not assessable, difficult on the right, mild left
lower limb hypertone, Romberg test resulted positive, paraparetic deambulation, bilateral steppage gait (more on 
the left then on the right), possible through costant aid for 20 meters. EDSS=6.5. On 31 Jan 2014 a brain MRI was 
performed (with and without contrast medium administration) which, when compared to a previous exam on 26 Sep
2013, showed bihemispheric fronto-temporal-parietal, cerebellar and brainstem multiple demyelinating areas, 
unchanged in number and size. By the way a wide signal alteration area appeared, hyperintense in FLAIR, involving
the right temporal-occipital junction and, although the above mentioned limits a mild enhancement after contrast

medium administration was recognized, like it was a blood brain barrier damage. The circonvolutions in this area 
resulted swollen with a consequent subarachnoid spaces occlusion. These findings could be compatible, if 
confirmed by a clinical picture, with a PML diagnosis. A very close follow up is needed in order to follow its 
evolution. Supratentorial and subtentorial ventricular system showed a discrete increase in size. The event outcome
was not reported. Causality was not assessed. The last TYSABRI infusion was administered on 16 Dec 2013.
Update 12 Feb 2014: This case was received from the Italian regulatory agency via the National Pharmacovigilance
Network (regulatory reference number: 237462). The patient's initials were updated. It was clarified that the patient 
had started TYSABRI treatment on 01 Aug 2010 (discrepant from previous report of Jun 2010). Concomitant 
medication included Lioresal (baclofen) for 6 years from 01 Dec 2007 and Efexor (venlafaxine) for 8 years from 01 
Apr 2005. Causality between the event of suspect PML and TYSABRI was assessed as probable. A CSF sample 
was drawn on 04 Feb 2014 and the results were pending.
Update 17 Feb 2014: The neurologist reported that the results of CSF JCV DNA testing, performed at (b) (6)  
laboratory, had returned positive for JCV DNA at 330 copies/ml
Update 19 Feb 2014: Upon internal expert panel review, this case was considered confirmed for PML based on 
positive CSF and MRI.
Update 19 Feb 2014: Additional information was received from the neurologist via a MS Standardized PML Data 
Collection Tool. The patient tested negative for anti-Natalizumab antibodies on 23 Feb 2011. Serum anti-JCV 
antibody status on 24 Mar 2011 was positive.  The neurologist assessed the patient s estimated Karnofsky and 
EDSS scores as follows: on 26 Jul 2010 (prior to TYSABRl) to be 60 (requires occasional assistance, but is able to 
care for most of her personal needs) and 7; on 25 Sep 2013 (on TYSABRl, prior to PML) to be 60 and 6.5; and on 
31 Jan 2014 (at time of PML diagnosis) to be 60 and 6.5. An MRI was performed on 26 Sep 2013 and on 31 Jan 
2014 (previously reported). A lumbar puncture was performed on 31 Jan 2014 and was positive for CSF JCV DNA 
at 330 copies per mL. Currently, the patient is alive and residing at home. She has not recovered from PML. 
Causality for the event was assessed as related to TYSABRI.
Update 21 Feb 2014:  An update was received from the National Pharmacovigilance Network (registry number 
237462).  The patient is alive.  In addition to PML (onset 10 Jan 2014) the patient reported a single episode of 
auditory hallucination (onset 10 Jan 2014) of probable epileptic origin.  The patient's anti-JCV antibody status was 
tested via STRATIFY.  The patient did not report any malignancies or relapses (presumed MS) since her "last visit" 
(date of last visit not reported).  On 31 Jan 2014 the patient had an MRI (results previously reported), the patient's 
EDSS was 6.5 (previously reported), and the white blood cell count (WBC) was in "normal range".  The patient did 
not report any pregnancies.

Update 03 Mar 2014:  Upon follow-up it was determined that the patient was enrolled as a subject in the (b) (6)  
  Per the study investigator, the subject started TYSABRl on 28 Aug 2010 and 
the last infusion was administered on 13 Dec 2013 (dates discrepant).  The subject was diagnosed with MS on 01 
Jan 1990 (date discrepant).  The event of PML, characterized by a single episode of auditory hallucination of 
epilectic origin, and a new large area in the T-O right lobe with enhancement suggestive of PML was assessed as 
severe.  The investigator considered the event related to TYSABRl.
Update 19 Jun 2014: Additional information was received from a physician via the MS Standardized PML Data 
Collection Tool and a diagnostic report. The patient is alive, is currently in the hospital, and is not on any MS 
therapy. The physician reported the patient has left hemiplegia, left lateral homonymous hemianopia, and is 
bedridden. She is alert, cooperative, and is sometimes confused. She has ideo-motor slowing. She reported a 
fracture of the right femur following an accidental fall (date unspecified). She has dysphagia and paroxysmal 
trigeminal pain. The physician assessed the patient s estimated Karnofsky and EDSS scores on 12 Jun 2014 to be
40 (disabled; requires special care and assistance) and 8.0. A brain MRI was performed on 17 Apr 2014 (results 
not reported) and on 20 May 2014 with results reported as follows: compared to the previous exam performed on 
17 Apr 2014, the current one shows a decrease of the mass effect and a decrease of the edema of the wide right 
subcortical hemispheric area of signal alteration, along with a significant decrease of the contrastographic 
enhancing areas and a restricted diffusion, still persists, punctiform, in the right parietal subcortical area. The 
swelling of the involved circonvolutions resulted reduced and the median line resulted on axis. The multifocal 
leucoencephalopathy picture, confluent, of the left hemisphere and the brainstem/cerebellum, resulted unchanged 
without any sign of contrast enhancement. The patient was diagnosed with IRIS, which was determined by clinical 
symptoms and MRI findings. Clinical symptoms included the following: seizures (absences, partial, and status 
epilepticus at EEG) with onset date of 28 Feb 2014, cognitive/ behavioral (ideo-motor slowing, confusion, 
drowsiness), motor (left hemiplegia), and visual symptoms (left lateral homonymous hemianopia) with an onset 
date of 29 Mar 2014. The following medications were administered as treatment for IRIS: Maraviroc 30 mg PO BID 
since 07 Apr 2014, methylprednisolone 1 GM IV daily from 03 Apr to 21 May 2014, Synacthen Depot 1 mg IV daily 
from 21 May to 06 Jun 2014, and Keppra (levetiracetam) 1500 mg PO BID since 28 Feb 2014. No additional 
lumbar punctures have been performed. The patient has not recovered from PML and IRIS. Causality for the 
events was assessed as related to TYSABRI.
Update 15 Sep 2014:  The following report was received from literature.  Spadaro M, Marnetto F, Caldano M, 
Lugaresi A, and Bertolotto A.  Effect of natalizumab treatment on circulating CD4+CD62L+ T-cells in multiple 
sclerosis patients.  Presented at 30th Congress of the European Committee for Treatment and Research in Mutliple
Sclerosis; P968.  Four months after natalizumab withdrawal, and under steroid treatment, the patient's CD62L 
expression was 30.48% (date of testing and reference ranges not reported).

Update 09 Feb 2015: Additional information was received from a neurologist via the MS Standardized PML Data 
Collection Tool. The patient is alive, residing at home, and is not currently on any MS therapy. The neurologist 
assessed the patient's estimated Karnofsky and EDSS scores on 28 Nov 2014 to be 40 (disabled; requires special 
care and assistance) and 7.5 to 8.0, respectively. The most recent brain MRI was performed on 06 Nov 2014 
(results not provided). As of 24 Sep 2014, the patient has recovered from PML and has recovered from IRIS. 
Causality for the event of PML was assessed as related to TYSABRI. Causality for the event of IRIS to TYSABRI 
was not assessed. The reporter noted that it was difficult to distinguish PML from IRIS outcome.
Update 23 Feb 2015:  Gerevini S, Caliendo G, Cava M, Capra R, De Rossi N, Falini A, and Cosottini M.
Natalizumab related PML:  Atypical neuroradiological findings.  Presented at the 27th Annual Meeting of the 
European Congress of Radiology (ECR); Vienna Austria.  03 Mar 2015.  Eighteen patients with suspected PML 
lesions were sampled.  Three radiologic patters were defined:  anergic, mainly white matter non-enhancing lesions, 
inflammatory white matter lesions with punctate or curvilinear enhancement and atypical.  Lesions prevail in the left 
frontal lobe.  Focal lesions involved the subcortical WM in 16 patients, the deep WM in 10 and the grey matter 8 
cases. PML lesions were hypointense on T1w and hyperintense on DWI in 14 pts. All patients have hyperintense 
lesions on T2w images. Focal lesions enhanced in 5 cases. At the beginning of the disease pattern A was observed
in 3 patients and pattern B in 3 cases. The "atypical pattern" with cortical involvement was detected in 9 patients 
and with "milky way sign" in 5.
