Medically Significant
A neurologist spontaneously reported that a 34 year old male patient on TYSABRI (300 mg, IV, QM) for relapsing 
remitting Multiple Sclerosis from 2003 to 29 Jan 2014 experienced PML suspicion (onset unknown).  The patient 
was seen in the outpatient clinic complaining of gradual progression of disease, especially on the right side, and 
was experiencing worsening memory.  The patient is anti-JCV antibody positive (unknown date).  The patient had 
an MRI on 29 Jan 2014 and a repeat MRI on 10 Apr 2014 which showed hyper-intense confluent lesions left high 
parietal, non-enhancing primarily in the white matter.  The physician had a feeling on the previous scan (presumed 
29 Jan 2014 MRI) that irregularities could be seen "at that point" (presumed left high parietal).  A lumbar puncture 
was performed on (b) (6)  which was sent to (b) (6)  lab, and results are pending.  The event of PML suspicion 
is ongoing. The causality for the event of PML suspicion is unknown.  TYSABRI therapy was discontinued, and he

patient was started on Gilenya (fingolimod) on 01 Apr 2014.
Update 17 Apr 2014: Follow-up information was received from the reporting neurologist.  The neurologist reported 
that testing for CSF JCV DNA at both a local lab and (b) (6)  lab was negative.  No further information provided.
Update 18 Apr 2014:  Follow-up information was received from the reporting neurologist.  The neurologist 
spontaneously reported that per peer review of the MRI images from a neuroradiologist who is specialized in PML, 
the patient's radiologic picture is 100% PML.  No further information provided.
Update 22 Apr 2014:  Upon follow up, it was confirmed that the patient discontinued TYSABRI treatment at the end 
of STRATA (101-MS-321), and the last dose of TYSABRI was administered on 29 Jan 2014.  The patient is no 
longer seen by the neurologist at the (b) (6) study site and is under the care of another neurologist at a different 
location.  As the patient is still within the 12-week follow-up period, additional follow up will determine if this case will
need to be reported under the (b) (6)  protocol.
Update 24 Apr 2014:  Upon follow-up from the treating physician, it was reported that the patient deteriorated over 
the weekend and motor function in right arm was almost completely gone.  Follow up MRI from 22 Apr 2014 
showed "no difference".  A CSF JSV sample was tested at internal labs at Biogen Idec (with consent from 
physician) and was weak positive with 3.55copies/mL, however the sample was compromised due to shipping.  A 
second lumbar puncture was scheduled for (b) (6)   The following information was also provided.  Towards 
the end of the (b) (6)  study, the patient was getting gradually worse with MS and had one relapse at visit week 
360, and another relapse at week 388.  The patient's EDSS went from 5.5 in Feb 2012 to over 6 in Aug 2012, and 
then up to 6.5 at the last study visit on 29 Jan 2014.  The last MRI performed while the patient was enrolled in 
(b) (6)  occurred on 29 Jan 2014 and showed no PML. The patient was last seen on 02 Apr 2014 at the 12 week 
(b) (6)  follow up period.  No further information provided.
Update 06 May 2014: Additional information received from the physician reported that both samples sent to (b) (6)
on 28 April 2014 returned positive. No further details were known at this point.
Update 08 May 2014: Upon follow-up, an SAE form was provided by the investigator indicating the patient was the 
male subject (ID (b) (6) ) and enrolled in the clinical trial, (b) (6)
(b) (6)
The subject was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis on an unknown date. The subject?s past medical history and 
conditions around the time of the event were not reported. Concomitant medications included Gilenya (fingolimod),

baclofen and Divisun (vitamin D3).  The subject had no allergy history. The subject's height and weight were not 
provided.
The subject had previously participated in protocol (b) (6)
 The subject 
enrolled in (b) (6)  and received his first dose of natalizumab (300 mg intravenous monthly) on 20 July 2006.
At the time of the event, (b) (6)  the subject had received ninety nine doses, with the last dose on 29 January
2014. The subject was hospitalized on (b) (6)  due to PML and as a result of the serious adverse event, the 
investigator permanently discontinued the study medication. 
The investigator considered the event of ?PML? related to suspect drug with the rationale for the assessment as 
"medically significant".
Additional information was expected.
Update 15 May 2014: Upon internal review, Biogen Idec considers this case to be confirmed for PML based on 
clinical symptoms, positive CSF, and MRI findings. 
Update 28 May 2014: Additional information received from the investigator confirmed the subject was first 
diagnosed with multiple sclerosis (MS) in 2001.  The subject?s height and weight were not known.  The subject?s 
medical history included neuritis optica, MS exacerbation, imbalance, coordination problems, urinary problems, 
walking problems and major depressive symptoms.  The Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score at the 
time of admission and discharge were not known.  The outcome and end date of the event was unknown.  Any 
additional serious criteria, treatments given and any additional SAE details were unknown as the PML follow up was
performed at another hospital.
Update 23 June 2014: Additional information received from the investigator confirmed the date of discharge was 
unknown and details regarding the discharge summary were unknown. 
Update 11 July 2014: Additional information was received from the investigator via a MS Standardized PML Data 
Collection Tool. On (b) (6)  a lumbar puncture was performed with results reported as negative for CSF JCV 
DNA ((b) (6) ) and inconclusive at 3.55 copies per mL. On (b) (6) , a lumbar puncture was performed with 
results reported as positive for CSF JCV DNA at 71 copies per mL (b) (6) . On this date, the subject also had a

positive blood JCV DNA result at 56 copies per mL. At the time of PML diagnosis (April 2014), the investigator 
assessed the subject?s estimated Karnofsky and EDSS scores to be 40 (disabled; requires special care and 
assistance) and 7. The subject was diagnosed with IRIS, which was determined by clinical symptoms and MRI 
findings. Focal motor symptoms (increased hemiparesis) and reduced consciousness were noted with an onset 
date of 08 May 2014. As treatment for IRIS, the subject received IV corticosteroid (methylprednisolone) five times 
from 08 May to 20 June 2014; mirtazapine 60 mg orally from 11 June to 15 June 2014; and mefloquine 250 mg 
orally from 11 June to 15 June 2014. Currently, the subject is residing in a nursing home and has not recovered 
from PML and IRIS. Causality for the events was assessed as related to TYSABRI.
Update 06 Nov 2014: Additional information was received from the neurologist via a MS Standardized PML Data 
Collection Tool. The subject is alive, residing at home, and is not currently on any MS therapy. The neurologist 
assessed the subject'ss estimated Karnofsky and EDSS scores on 06 Nov 2014 to be 40 (disabled; requires 
special care and assistance) and 8.5. The date of the most recent brain MRI was 20 Jun 2014 (results not 
provided).  As of 06 Nov 2014, the subject has not recovered from PML and has recovered from IRIS. Causality for 
the events was assessed as related to TYSABRI.
Update 12 May 2015: Additional information was received from the neurologist via a MS Standardized PML Data 
Collection Tool. The subject is alive, residing at home, and is not currently on any MS therapy. The neurologist 
assessed the subject's estimated Karnofsky and EDSS scores on 12 May 2015 to be 50 (requires considerable 
assistance and frequent medical care) and 8. The date of the most recent brain MRI was 20 Jun 2014 (results not 
provided).  As of 12 May 2015, the subject has not recovered from PML and has recovered from IRIS. Causality for 
the events was assessed as related to TYSABRI.
