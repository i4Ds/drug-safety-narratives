A neurologist spontaneously reported that a 43 year old female patient on TYSABRI (300 mg, IV, QM) for Multiple 
Sclerosis from Sep 2012 to 31 Mar 2014 was hospitalized from (b) (6)  to an unknown date for PML suspicion 
(onset Mar 2014). Since mid-March, approximately, 14 Mar [2014], the patient experienced motor deficit, 
accompanied with clonic movement "probably of epileptic origin" in right upper limb, worsening progressively. The 
patient underwent a brain MRI in Sep (20)13 that showed "no particularity". The patient underwent a brain MRI on 
(b) (6)  which showed left subcortical frontal lesion in FLAIR and diffusion, with blurred contours, non-
gadolinium-enhanced  (-Gd), and very suggestive for PML. A new MRI on (b) (6)  was not interpretable. On (b)(6)
Mar [2014], the patient's EDSS score was 0.5. It was also reported that the patient had tested positive for JCV 
antibodies in 2012 (index value unknown).  It was reported that plasmatic exchange would start immediately after 
the planned lumbar puncture (LP) was performed, note to be performed "as soon as possible".  No concomitant 
medications were reported. The patient had no history of immunosuppressant therapy. Previous MS therapy 
included Avonex (dates of therapy not provided). It was reported that the patient had not experienced a MS relapse 
since starting on TYSABRI therapy. The event of PML suspicion is ongoing. The causality for the event of PML 
suspicion was assessed as related.  TYSABRI therapy was discontinued, and it was noted that the patient had her 
last and 21st TYSABRI infusion on 31 Mar 2014.  French imputability C2S2I2
Update 16 Apr 2014:  The neurologist, same as initial reporter, reported that the patient underwent a "PL" 
(presumed lumbar puncture) and the samples were planned to be sent to (b) (6)  The patient tested positive on 05 
Sep 2012 for anti-JCV antibodies. French Imputability C2S2I2
Update 17 Apr 2014: A second neurologist reported that the patient underwent a LP on (b) (6)  samples were 
sent to (b) (6)  for JCV PCR test, result pending.  French Imputability C2S2I2
Update 28 Apr 2014: A third neurologist specified that he was not in charge of the patient prior to hospitalization; 
therefore, he won't be able to provide us with further details on patient's medical history. The neurologist also 
reported that the patient underwent 4 sessions of plasma exchange, 1st session on (b) (6)  French 
Imputability: C2S2I2
Update 30 Apr 2014: The neurologist reported that he received the (b) (6)  (testing) report which was positive (for 
JCV) at 2005 c/mL.  French Imputability C2S2I2
Update 08 May 2014: Upon internal review, Biogen Idec considers this case confirmed for PML based on positive 
CSF, positive MRI, and clinical symptoms.
Update 15 May 2014: The neurologist reported that the patient is at home and her clinical condition is stable. Some 
clonic movements are still present in her right upper limb. No IRIS. New control MRIs are planned on 20 May 2014

and 28 May 2014. The second  (b) (6) [JCV PCR test] result returned negative  (LP on (b) (6) ). The 
neurologist assesed PML as related to TYSABRI. The patient has no treatment for PML or MS now.  French 
Imputability C2S2I2.
Update 23 May 2014: Additional information was received from the neurologist. Control MRI on (b) (6)
showed slight increasing of PML lesion. No clinical or radiological IRIS signs. Patient is stable and at home. French 
Imputability C2S2I2
Update 04 Jun 2014: Additional information was received from the neurologist. According to the neurologist, the 
patient was hospitalized on (b) (6)  for clinical worsening (NOS), was in reanimation [intensive care] for status
epilepticus from (b) (6)  to(b) (6)  and then transferred to the neurology department on (b) (6) .  A 
MRI performed this time (unknown date) showed slight Gd enhancement not in favor of IRIS. Consequently, no 
corticotherapy was started. A new LP [lumbar puncture] was planned. French Imputability C2S2I2.
Update 24 Jun 2014:Additional information was received from a health care professional. He reported the patient 
underwent an LP on (b) (6)  and samples were sent to (b) (6)  and (b) (6)  laboratory;results pending. French 
Imputability C2S2I2.
Update 04 Jul 2014:  The following information was received from the French Health Authorities (registry number 
LM20140472).  Past medical history included fibromyalgia and spasmophilia.  The patient was diagnosed with MS 
in 2009.  The patient received a total of 22 infusions of TYSABRl, with the last infusion administered on 31 Mar 
2014.  Testing included anti JCV antibody testing (date unknown), an MRI in Mar 2014, and an MRI on(b) (6)
(results previously reported).  In Mar 2014 the patient experienced symptoms including weakness, difficulty writing, 
speech impairment, and sometimes lack of words.  The patient was hospitalized from (b) (6)  to (b) (6)
for PLEX.  An EEG (date unknown) showed no abnormalities.  An MRI was done on 20 May 2014 (results 
previously reported).  On (b) (6)  the patient was hospitalized for worsening neurological status characterized 
by aphasia and aggravation of symptoms affecting the upper right limb.   An EEG (date unknown) showed no 
epileptiform activity.  An MRI (date unknown) showed stability of lesions.  On (b) (6)  the patient experienced 
2 generalized tonic-clonic seizures.  Treatment included thiopental and midazolam.  An MRI (date unknown) 
showed lesions that were "evocative of PML".  An MRI on (b) (6)  showed a clear progression of lesions, the 
lesions were not characteristic of PML (U fibers not affected).  Concomitant treatment included Laroxyl 
(amitriptyline), Cymbalta (duloxetine), Contramal (tramadol), Neurontin (gabapentin), and Lioresal (baclofen).

(NOS).  According to the neurologist, the patient was clinically stable with aphasia and hemiplegia of the right side 
of the body.  A second test [CSF JCV PCR] performed at(b) (6)  on (b) (6)  came back positive with 14 
copies/mL.  The last MRI performed on (b) (6)  showed lesion spread in FLAIR and many contrast 
enhancement; however, previous MRIs from (b) (6)  and (b) (6)  were both stable. The next MRI is 
scheduled for late Sep, early Oct. No further information was provided. French Imputability: C1S1I1.
Update 09 Oct 2014:  Additional information was received from a neurologist. The patient is followed at the hospital 
where the patient's clinical picture and right hemibody deficit worsened with epileptic status; MRI (date unknown) 
showed lesion worsening. The neurologist recently saw the patient who was in a rehabilitation center and noted that
the patient had right hemiplegia predominantly in the right upper limb and motor aphasia. No further information 
was provided. French Imputability: C2S3I3
Update 04 Dec 2014: Additional information was received from the French Health Authorities (reference: 
LM20140472).  PML diagnosis seemed to be confirmed following consultation on 27 Oct 2014. After an unspecified
period, the patient experienced right hemiparesis and phasic disorders that were still substantial at the time of 
reporting.  MRIs performed on an unspecified date did not show MS reactivation. Immunomodulator therapy was 
not restarted at the time of reporting. The French Health Authorities retained PML as an adverse event [10036806 
V17.1] and considered that TYSABRI is unlikely related to the PML. French Imputability: C1S1I1.
Update 22 Jan 2015: Additional information was received from a neurologist via a MS Standardized PML Data 
Collection Tool. The patient is alive, residing at a rehabilitation facility, and is not currently on any MS therapy. The 
neurologist assessed the patient s estimated Karnofsky and EDSS scores on 13 Jan 2015 to be 40 (disabled; 
requires special care and assistance) and 7.0. Leukocyte count performed on 13 Jan 2015 was 6.91 Giga/L 
(normal range 4-10 Giga/L). Absolute lymphocyte count on 13 Jan 2015 was 1.78 G/L (normal range 1.24-3.56 
G/L). A brain MRI performed on 13 Jan 2015 was compatible with a PML less extended and less active compared 
to the MRI performed on 08 Oct 2014. The patient s IRIS was diagnosed by clinical symptoms and MRI findings. 
Clinical symptoms included cognitive/behavioral (NOS) (onset 30 May 2014), right hemiplegia (focal motor) (date 
unknown), aphasia (speech) (date unknown), right focal seizure and generalized seizures (date 30 May 2014).  The
patient did not receive corticosteroids pre-IRIS onset. Treatment for IRIS included methylprednisolone 1 GM IV 
daily from 19 Jun 2014 to 23 Jun 2014 and levetiracetam 750 mg PO twice daily (treatment dates not provided). 
The patient has not recovered from PML as of 13 Jan 2015. The patient has recovered from IRIS. Causality for the 
events of PML and IRIS was assessed as related to TYSABRI.  French Imputability:  C1S1I1.
Update 01 Jun 2015:  Additional information was received from a neurologist.  The patient is stabilized and now 
followed by another neurologist.  French Imputability:  C2S3I3.
