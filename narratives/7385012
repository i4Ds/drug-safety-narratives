This clinical trial case concerns a 39-year-old Black male patient. 
The patient had no relelivManiltm m7ec7777.7MnrRi.aMntrr9ielWns included dexamethasone as per protocol, 
minerals/vitamins, paracetamol, lorazepam, methylprednisolone sodium succinate, aprepitant, ondansetron 
hydrochloride, buphenorphine hydrochloride and sodium chloride as prophylaxis, and pantoprazole sodium, 
amitryptiline hydrochloride, and metronidazole benzoate for unknown indications. It was unknown if the patient was 
receiving folic acid or vitamin B12 according to protocol. On 17-Mar-2010, the patient first received intravenous 
pemetrexed, 500 mg/m2 and intravenous cisplatin 75 mg/m2, on day one every 21 days, and intravenous 
cetuximab loading dose 400 mg/m2 on day one cycle one, then 250 mg/m2 weekly, in the induction phase of the 
study. The patient last received all three study drugs prior to the event on 28-Apr-2010, for the treatment of 
squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck. The patient had not commenced the maintenance phase of the 
study. On theme M id a y s after last receiving all three study drugs, the patient was hospitalised for 
dyspnoea. The event of dyspnoea was initially a non-serious event. Upon follow-up it was reported that the cause of 
dyspnoea was pneumonia. The same day on- laboratory results showed a haemoglobin of 10.8 g/dL 
(normal range 13-17), erythrocyte sedimentation rate 56 mm/U (normal range 0-10), haematocrit 34.9 % (normal 
range 40-50), red blood cell count 3.88 x10^12/L (normal range 4.40-5.50), red cell distribution width 17.3% 
(normal range 11.6-14.6), platelet count 485 x10^9/L (normal range 140-440), white cell count 9.6 (normal range 
4.3-10), absolute neutrophils 8.93 x10"9/L (normal range 2-7), absolute lymphocytes 0.67 x10^9/L (normal range 1-
3), absolute monocytes 0 x10^9/L (normal range 0.10-1.00), absolute basophils 0 x10"9/L (normal range -0.02-
0.10), D dimer 1.1 ug/ml (normal range 0-0.6), creatinine 0.56 mg/dL (normal range 0.62-1.10), urea 42 mg/dL 
(normal range 13-43), sodium 136 mmol/L (normal range 136-145), potassium 4.4 mmol/L (normal range 3.5-5.1), 
chloride 96mmol/L (normal range 98-107), C-reactive protein 0.78 mg/dL (normal range <0.30), serum glucose 92 
mg/dL (normal range 74-100), aspartate aminotransferase 14 U/L (normal range 16-37), alanine aminotransferase 
8 U/L (normal range 13-57), gamma-glutamyltransferase 81 U/L (normal range 15-55), total bilirubin 0.19 mg/dL 
(normal range 0.30-1.20), triglycerides 184 mg/dL (normal range not reported). On a unknown date a chest x-ray 
RX) and computer tomography (CT) scan of the thorax were performed but no results were reported. The 
pneumonia was treated with amoxicillin sodium/clavulance potassium starting 30-Apr-2010. On the morning of the 
1111111111111111. days after last dose of study drugs, the patient was found dead in his hospital bed. Event of 
death also serious for hospitalisation. The event was originally reported as sudden death then amended to death. 
At the time of reporting the casue of death was unknown. An autopsy was to be performed, but results were not 
currently available. No further information was provided. It was not confirmed whether if the event of pneumonia 
was the casue of death. It was unknown if the event of pneumonia was ongoing at the time of the patient's death or 
if therapy with all three study drugs was continuing (a stop date of 02-May-2010 was reported on the SAE form). 
In the investigator's opinion the event of death was possibly related to all three study drugs as treatment possibly 
caused pneumonia and pneumonia was probable cause of death (pneumonia not confirmed as cause of death), but 
was unrelated to protocol procedures. The dyspnea which was a symptom of the pneumonia was considered 
related to study drug and protocol procedures. This case is linked with BE201003005655 as it concerns the same
