This literature case, r  a -0 by health care professionals concerns an adult patient (median age was 66 years 
( 32 to 81 years) of gender and origin. Medical history included locally advanced unresectable non- 
small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). It was -0 a ed that the patient required to have histologic or cytologic diagnosis of 
NSCLC,  0 -rable stage MA or stage 1118 disease, measurable disease according the Response Evaluation 
Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 to 1, age 
greater or equal to 18 years, and  ' loss greater or equal to 10% in the past 3 months. Laboratory 
requirements were as 0o : an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) of greater or equal to 1,500/L, platelets greater 
or equal to 100;000 L, a calculated creatinine clearance (CrCI) of greater or equal to 45 mLlrnin, bilirubin 1.5 x 
upper limit of normal (ULN), MT and ALT less than 3 x ULN, and alkaline phosphatase less than 3 x ULN. Patients 
were required to undergo FOG-PET imaging, computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest and abdomen, and 
tests before 0  ent. Patients were required to have a mediastinal lymph node (LN) of 
greater or 0  to 2 cm by CT scans, if the mediastinal LN was less than 2 cm, then biopsy confirmation of 
Involvement in mediastinal LN was required (regardless of the results of PET imaging). Patients with

contralateral mediastinal LN disease (N3) were eligible if disease could be encompassed within a single radiation 
field. Patients with scalene, supradavicular, and contralateral hilar IN involvement based on assessment of the 
treating physician; direct,  invasion of vertebral o o o y; or exudative, bl...y, or cytologically malignant pleural effusions 
were not . Prior chemotherapy for NSCLC, chest irradiation therapy, or therapy directed at the epidermal 
growth factor receptor pathway was not a . Patients who were pregnant or nursing; with known 
hypersensitivity to a, o o atin, pemetrexed, or a monoclonal antibody; or who were HIV positive were ineligible. 
Con t medication included carboplatin and cetuximab for the treatment of locally advanced unresectable 
non-small-ceN lung cancer, folic acid, cyanocobalamin, dexamethasone and diphenhydramine. Patient began 
taking pemetrexed (unknown manufacturer) 500 mg/m2, over 10 minutes every 21 days for four cycles for 
treatment of locally advanced unresectable non-small-cell lung cancer beginning on an unknown date. Patient also 
received carboplatin area under the curve (AUC,) of six using the Calvert equation over 30 minutes and thoracic 
radiation (TRT) a cumulative dose of 70 Gy in 35 daily fractions of two Gy commencing on day one. 
Dipherihydramine 50 mg Intravenously was also given 30 to 60 minutes before the first dose of cetuximab 400 
rngtm2 over 120 minutes on day one of week one and then 250 mg/m2 over 60 minutes weekly for six weeks. On 
an date from commencing treatment patient died due to pneumonitis. It was unknown if an autopsy was 
ted. Corrective treatment and action taken of pemetrexed at the time if death was unknown. The re..  g 
health care professional stated that pneumonftis was related to pemetrexed treatment. This case is linked to:
