Medically Significant
A neurologist spontaneously reported that a female patient (age unknown) on TYSABRI (300 mg, IV, QM) for an 
unknown indication from unknown date to Jan 2014 experienced suspected PML (onset unknown).  Due to 
significant clinical deterioration and highly PML suspected MR findings (NOS) (a radiologist suspected PML), CSF 
analysis for JCV DNA will be performed on Monday (presume 30 Mar 2015).  It is unknown if the patient received 
any treatment for the event. The outcome for the event suspected PML is unknown. The causality for the event of 
suspected PML is unknown.  TYSABRI therapy was discontinued.
Update 01 Apr 2015:  Additional information was received from the neurologist.  The patient's initials and date of 
birth were provided.  The patient was on TYSABRI for multiple sclerosis.  CSF JCV DNA result (sampling date 30 
Mar 2015) came back positive (24 copies/ml) from (b) (6)

FOIA Case Report Information
Suspect via a Biogen Employee (Medical Science Liaison).  The patient on TYSABRI from Oct 2012 to Jan 2014 
(therapy was not interrupted for greater than 3 months) was being evaluated for PML due to clinical signs and 
symptoms which prompted MRI which revealed suspicious findings.  The patient is currently at home. The patient 
was diagnosed with MS on 15 Jun 2012.  MS disease symptoms prior to suspected PML included paraparesis 
(motor/motorfocal) and ataxia (cerebellar) (onsets unknown). The patient has never received prior 
immunosuppressant or immunomodulatory therapy.  Signs and symptoms which led to the evaluation for possible 
PML included left hemiparesis (motor/multifocal) (onset 11 Mar 2015), dizziness (cerebellar) (onset 11 Mar 2015), 
and paraesthesiae on both legs (sensory/multifocal) (onset unknown).  A MRI at the time of suspected PML 
diagnosis was performed on 26 Mar 2015 (presume MRI previously reported that was highly suspicion of PML 
(NOS)).  A lumbar puncture was performed on 30 Mar 2015 and CSF sample was tested on 01 Apr 2015 at 
(b) (6)  CSF JCV DNA result was positive (24 copies/ml) (previously reported).  The patient tested positive for 
serum anti-JCV antibody at (b) (6)  in Oct 2012 with an index value of 2.83 and in Jan 2014 with an index value of 
2.81.  A brain biopsy was not performed. Test results prior to starting TYSABRI in Oct 2012 included the following:
leukocyte count of 5.1 x 10^9/l, absolute lymphocyte count of 1.1 x 10^9/l, CD4 of 575 cells/mm3, CD8 of 210 
cells/mm3, and CD4/CD8 ratio of 2.74 (normal ranges not provided, but it was noted that these results were in 
normal range).  Test results on TYSABRI prior to PML suspicion in Oct 2014 included the following: leukocyte count
of 7.8 x 10^9/l, absolute lymphocyte count of 2.5 x 10^9/l, CD4 of 1081 cells/mm3, CD8 of 373 cells/mm3, and 
CD4/CD8 ratio of 2.9 (normal ranges not provided, but it was noted that these results were in normal range).  CSF 
analysis performed on 30 Mar 2015 was abnormal, pleocytosis was noted.  The patient has not been treated with 
plasma exchange (PLEX) or immunoadsorption (IA).  The patient has never been and is not currently enrolled in a 
Biogen Idec Clinical Trial or non-Biogen Idec Clinical Trial.  At the time of this report, PML was still under 
investigation.
Update 02 Apr 2015:  Follow-up information was received from a Biogen Employee (Medical Science Liaison).  MRI
images from 26 Mar 2015 were provided.  No further information was provided.
Update 16 Apr 2015:  Follow-up information was received from a Biogen Employee (Medical Science Liaison).  The
medical science liaison confirmed that the patient has a very active form of RRMS; she was treated with TYSABRI 
as first line treatment. In Jan 2014, the patient received her last dose of TYSABRI and therapy was stopped by her 
personal decision and she didn?t agree with any other treatment. The patient didn't receive any other [MS] 
treatment, only TYSABRI.  According to the treating physician, the patient's clinical status was improving.  The 
results of MRI performed last week (date not provided, presume Apr 2015) were the same as last MRI (date not 
provided, presume in reference to previously reported MRI on 26 Mar 2015).  MRI images from 30 Oct 2014 were 
provided.  Repeat MRI and CSF examinations will be performed on 28 Apr [2015]. The patient tested negative for 
HIV (date unknown).  Two more CSF samples are available, which will be sent for JCV PCR testing.  With the 
patient's improving clinical status and improving MRI, this case was probably not PML.

Update 16 Apr 2015:  Additional information was provided by the neurologist.  The clinical status of the patient was 
improving now.  The last MRI (performed last week) had improved too.  Question had been raised if the CSF 
results could be false positive. The MRI and CSF examinations will be repeated on the 28 Apr 2015. One leftover 
CSF sample is planned to be sent to (b) (6)
Update 20 Apr 2015:  Follow-up information was received from a Biogen Employee (Medical Science Liaison).
CSF sample has been shipped to (b) (6)   A repeat CSF [JCV] DNA and MRI will be performed on 28 Apr 2015; CSF 
sample will be shipped to(b) (6)  for testing.
Update 27 Apr 2015: Follow-up information received reported the result of the CSF sample from the (b) (6)  laboratory 
was negative (another CSF sample collected the same day had tested positive at (b) (6) ). The clinical status of the
patient was improving.
Update 29 Apr 2015: The treating physician reported that in her opinion and the opinion of the head of neurology, 
the patient experienced progression of MS, no PML. They suspected it was a "false positive result from (b) (6) " 
[CSF JCV DNA] and repeat test was requested.
Update 06 May 2015: Follow-up information received reported that two samples of blood (for plamsa and serum) 
and one sample of urine were sent [for testing] on 06 May 2015. The patient did not agree to lumbar puncture, so 
no CSF was sent.
Update 11 May 2015: Follow up information reported the repeat result from (b) (6)  (previously reported blood and 
urine samples) was negative. Due to the improving clinical and MRI status of the patient, this case was not PML in 
the opinion of the treating physician. The patient is planned for the treatment with Tecfidera.
Update 14 May 2015: Biogen considers this case downgraded to low suspect PML based on false positive CSF, 
clinical improvement, and pending details of follow-up MRI.
Update 15 May 2015: Follow-up information received indicated the patient underwent a new MRI and the image 
would be provided.  No further information was provided.
