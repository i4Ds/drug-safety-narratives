Patient index number as per the appendix 2:7861486 
Comment: Medical examiner suspicious of pseudoephedrine toxicity 
As per the report, In 15 infants blood pseudoephedrine concentrations ranged between 0,07 mg/L and 13.0 mg/L. 
with a mean concentration of 3.55 mg/L. 
Cause-of-death information is the opinion of the certifier and may not be accurate. In some cases, 
pseudoephedrine levels were also measured in tissues or body fluids. 
The data do not allow definitive statements about the toxicity of pseudoephedrine at given concentrations. 
Concentrations falling in the upper portion of the range should certainly be viewed with suspicion, however a paucity 
of data exists concerning pseudoephedrine levels in infants. Baselt reported a level of 66 mg/L in a child who 
ingested at least seven 60-mg tablets (1983, Poisiodex), a concentration much higher than the highest level 
observed in the above data. A blood level of 6.0 mg/L was reported in a 3-month-old who died after accidental 
ingestion of an unspecified amount of pseudoephedrine (blood carbinoxamine was 0.4 mg/L) (Am J Emergency 
Med 1989; 7{5}:495). A Medline search provided information that pseudoephedrine has been associated with each 
of the following conditions but not necessarily in children: a pseudoscarletina dermatitis, contact dermatitis, seizures 
in an infant, rhabdomyclysis, central nervous system hemorrhage, hallucinations in a child, and hypertension. Also, 
pseudoephedrine is reportedly secreted in breast milk and crosses the placenta. 
The outcome of the event 'Toxicity to various agents' was reported as unknown and the outcome for Sudden infant 
death syndrome was reported as fatal at the time of this report. 
Case outcome: Fatal 
Ranbaxy medical reviewers comment: 
The case is deemed serious. The events are unexpected as per Pl. Medical reviewer assessed the events, in view 
of reasonable time relationship to drug intake, to be possibly related to the suspect drug as per the WHO-UMC 
system for standardized causality assessment.
