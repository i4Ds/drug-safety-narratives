Medically Significant
A health care professional reported via a Biogen Idec Medical Director that a 40 year old female patient, on 
TYSABRI (300 mg, IV, QM) for the past 4 years (exact date unknown) with clinical stability, was hospitalized due to 
suspected progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), onset unknown. Indication for TYSABRI was Multiple
Sclerosis diagnosed on an unknown date. The patient's MS was described as aggressive with ataxia and cognitive 
changes, gray matter lesions, and atrophy. The total number of TYSABRI doses administered prior to the event, 
suspected PML, is unknown; the last dose of TYSABRI was administered on 11 Jan 2013. Prior MS treatments 
included mitoxantrone. Medical history is unknown. STRATIFY JCV testing was positive (test date unknown). 
Concomitant medications include Cipramil (citalopram) 40 mg, baclofen 10 mg, levetiracetam 500 mg BID, and 
Vitamin B injections every 3 months.

Although the patient was asymptomatic, the patient was hospitalized in (b) (6)  (exact date unknown) after a 
routine MRI performed on (b) (6)  indicated modest changes compared to the previous MRI on 06 Feb 2013 
which showed signal changes in the pons. CSF JCV DNA performed on "approximately (b) (6)  at a local lab 
was positive (report pending). Treatment for the event, suspected PML, includes prophylactic IV MP 
(methylprednisolone), mirtazapine, mefloquine, and plasmapheresis. 
The outcome and causality for the event, suspected PML, are unknown. The patient remains hospitalized at the 
time of this report. Disposition of TYSABRI therapy is unknown.
Update 04 Mar 2013: Additional information was provided by the health care professional. The patient started 
TYSABRI therapy approximately 4.5 years ago. The reporter was concerned that the patient had PML after a 
routine MRI was performed. The patient had been asymptomatic and remains so at the time of this report. JCV 
antibody testing was performed "when it was first available some years ago." The reporter will provide a copy of the 
report as well as MRIs from 06 Feb 2013 and (b) (6)  CSF JCV testing was performed on 02 Feb 2013 but 
the reporter has not received the results. On (b) (6)  PLEX was started for 5 sessions. The patient remains
hospitalized as she lives 350 km away from the nearest city, hence, the logistics of transporting her to and from the 
hospital meant structural delays.
Update 12 Mar 2013: Additional information was provided by the health care professional now identified as the 
neurologist. The patient remains asymptomatic from her PML and will be discharged from the hospital on (b) (6)  
(b) (6)  The patient will be evaluated in 14 days as she lives in the country. Follow-up MRI shows minor IRIS 
(Immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome) in cerebellar peduncle and pons but it has not been causing any 
detectable symptoms or signs at this point in time over and above her neurological baseline. The patient remains 
on 1mg/kg oral prednisolone; mirtazapine; and weekly mefloquine. Results of the repeat JCV with copy count was 
expected on the day of this update ((b) (6) ). The neurologist will forward additional information to Biogen Idec
including CD ROMs of the MRIs as well as the reports effectively saying "this is not PML." The latest MRI report 
from (b) (6)  has been delayed. A repeat MRI is scheduled for 27 Mar 2013. The event, IRIS, is ongoing. 
Causality was not assessed.
Update 27 Mar 2013: Additional information was provided by the neurologist who saw the patient on 27 Mar 2013 
for an outpatient visit. The patient remains asymptomatic from her proven PML and her oral corticosteroids 
continue to be tapered. There is no clinical or radiological evidence of IRIS at present. The patient has been back at
work already for a few weeks. An MRI of the brain performed on 27 Mar 2013 revealed the following: Compared to 
the previous MRI on 06 Feb 2013, the small enhancing foci within the brain stem and left cerebellar hemisphere 
have resolved. There is no new areas of enhancement.  Stable white matter lesions are again shown on T2 
weighted images. There is no evidence of new areas of which matter signal abnormality and no current features of

IRIS. Additionally, the MRI report noted that plasmapheresis commenced on 02 Mar 2013 (date discrepant from 
date noted in 04 Mar 2012 update). The event, IRIS, has resolved; causality was not assessed.
Update 29 Apr 2013: Additional information provided from the neurologist in the form of medical records indicated 
that the patient was hospitalized from (b) (6)  to (b) (6)  The patient was diagnosed with Multiple 
Sclerosis in 1995. Prior MS therapies also included steroids and Betaferon (interferon beta 1a). It was indicated that
the patient the patient had a trial of compounded 4-aminopyridine (10mg, BD) but experienced a bad headache, 
was very dizzy, and 'had to hold onto the walls at work" and so the trial was stopped on 01 Mar 2012. The patient 
had been on TYSABRI therapy since 05 Sep 2008 and the most recent infusion was on 11 Jan 2013. The patient 
reported on 06 Feb 2013 feeling slightly more unsteady. It was specifically noted by the physician that the patient 
had initially denied any new symptoms and they (presumed the patient and her family) had moved to a new house. 
Because the MRI had shown some changes, the neurologist specified queried the patients symptoms to which she 
replied that "perhaps she had felt more unsteady". The neurologist, however, was unable to detect any changes in 
her clinical signs of status (spastic parapersis and walks with an elbow crutch). The following tests were reported: A
brain MRI from 08 Feb 2012 compared to that of 10 Aug 2011 found stable changes of intracranial demyelination 
particularly involving the corpus callosum and paraventricular white matter. There was moderate callosal atrophy. 
Symmetric prominence of the lateral ventricles was present and the ere was mild prominence of the convexity 
CVSF spaces. No changing lesions were identified to indicate active disease at the current time. There was no MR 
evidence of PML. No mass lesion, collection or haemorrhage was shown. The large cerebral arteries remained 
patent. A brain MRI from 08 Aug 2012 compared to that from 08 Feb 2012 found no abnormal cerebral 
parenchymal contrast enhancement to indicate active disease at the current time. Relatively extensive changes of 
demyelination are again shown particularly involving the periventricular white matter and corpus callosum. This 
reduced the sensitivity of the examination for demonstration of new lesions. There was no definite evidence of 
progression. Areas of juxtacortical white matter abnormality were again demonstrated, most prominent within the 
left occipital lobe anteroinferiorly. The appearance had not changed significantly on comparison with the prior study 
and there was no definite evidence of developmental PML. Multiple stable lesions were again shown within the 
brain stem and cerebellar hemispheres. Diffuse callosal atrophy was present along with moderate cerebral 
hemisphere atrophy. There was symmetric dilatation of the ventricles and there was no evidence of an intracranial 
mass lesion or collection. There large cerebral arteries remained patent. There was no significant interval changes 
since the 08 Feb 2012 examination. A lumbar puncture was performed on 12 Feb 2013 which revealed a high 
erythrocyte count in the second tube (700) and a third tube of 500 which likely indicated a traumatic tab. However, 
the sample was lost after it had been signed into the hospital. An MRI of the head performed on(b) (6)
compared to a previous study in 2007 found new punctate hyperintense focus seen in the brain stem and in the 
cerebellum with linear hyperintense cortical signal seen in the left cingulate gyrus and left occipital lobe. The 
appearance was consistent with te clinical history of MS. Radiographically, there was no typical confluent white 
matter changes to suggest PML. A positive JC Virus was noted. A chest x-ray performed on an unspecified date

revealed a right sided Hickman line demonstrated with the tip lying at the confluence of the subclavian and internal 
jugular veins. Cardiomediastinal contours were stable and the lungs and pleura remained clear. The patient 
received 5 sessions of plasmapharesis to eliminate TYSABRI from the blood and a central ine was inserted for this 
purpose. The patient also received 5 doses of intravenous methylprednisolone and was continued on oral 
prednisolone (50mg, QD, for 1-2 months depending on progress). The patient remained symptom free during the 
hospitalization and there were nil complication. A repeat MRI on an unspecified date showed changes suggestive of
Immune reconstitution syndrome in the occipital lobe but the patient did not have any worsening neurological signs. 
Comments from the brain MRI on (b) (6)  noted extensive changes of demylination. There had been interval 
development of multiple new lesions within the left side of the brain stem, the left cerebellar hemisphere and 
brachium pontis since 08 Aug 2012. Several of these showed enhancement with gadolinium. The MR appearance 
was most likely to reflect progressive disease despite treatment with Tysabri. PML, however, would also need to be 
considered in the differential diagnosis. Patchy foci of the contrast enhancement had been reported in up to 30-
40% of patients with natalizumab associated PML. A CSF test at a local lab on 26 Mar 2013 detected 63,910 
copies/mL of JCV, protein 0.44, glucose 3.3, leukocyte <2, and red cells 76. A prior CSF sample from 12 Feb 2013 
had been lost. A brain MRI on (b) (6)  in comparison to that from(b) (6)  found unchanged appearance 
of multiple demyelinating plaques throughout the periventricular deep white matter associated with cerebral atrophy.
No new lesions identified. Hyperintensity of the left middle cerebellar peduncle is unchanged in size and signal 
characteristics. There were no abnormal areas of diffusion restriction or contract enhancement. The patient was 
discharged with the following medications: baclofen, citalopram, clonazepam, levetiracetam, mefloquine, 
mirtazapine, oxybutynin, prednisolone, and Vitamin D3.
Update 06 May 2013: Biogen Idec considers this case confirmed for PML based on positive CSF, MRI findings, and
clinical symptoms
Update 20 May 2013: Additional information was received from the neurologist via a MS Standardized PML Data 
Collection Tool. The neurologist assessed the patient's estimated Karnofsky and EDSS scores (prior to starting 
TYSABRI) to be 60 (requires occasional assistance, but is able to care for most of personal needs) and 6 and (on 
TYSABRI prior to PML) to be 60 and 6. On an unknown date the patient had a positive JCV DNA blood test and a 
negative HIV test. In early March 2013 the patient underwent a lumbar puncture with results reported as positive at 
63,910 copies per/ml (previously reported as a CSF test at a local lab on 26 Mar 2013 detected 63,910 copies/mL 
of JCV). The neurologist assessed the estimated Karnofsky and EDSS scores (at time of PML diagnosis) to be 60 
and 6. On an unknown date the patient was tested for serum anti-JCV antibody status (result not provided). On 08 
May 2013 the patient underwent a lumbar puncture with results reported as positive at 3,619 copies per/ml. At the 
time of this report, the patient is residing at home and is still working. It is unknown if the patient recovered from 
PML.  Causality for the event of PML was assessed as unknown.

Update 28 Nov 2013: On a follow-up call to the patient she reported being in the hospital from 31 Oct 2013 until 07 
Nov 2013: she presented with jaw clenching, eye deviation suggested of focal seizures and weakening of lower 
limbs (events occurred 90 days after discontinuing TYSABRI). Recent medical history included MS, IRIS, and PML.
Treatment included IV steroids for 5 days and then she was discharged on oral steroids. The patient also reported 
having a history of seizures that was treated with Keppra Levetiracetam), since 2009. The patient has started on 
TECFIDERA therapy as of 26 Nov 2013.
Update 22 Apr 2014: Additional information was received from the neurologist via a MS Standardized PML Data 
Collection Tool. The patient is alive, residing at home and is currently on TECFIDERA for MS therapy. The 
neurologist assessed the patient s current clinical status as follows: unchanged, asymptomatic course of PML and 
asymptomatic IRIS.  The neurologist assessed the patient's estimated EDSS score on 05 Feb 2014 to be 6, and 
estimated Karnofsky score on 09 Apr 2014 to be 60 (requires occasional assistance, but is able to care for most of 
personal needs).  No additional lumbar punctures have been done. The patient recovered from both PML and IRIS 
(discrepant information). Causality for the events of PML and IRIS was assessed by the neurologist as related to 
TYSABRI (discrepant information).
Update 04 Aug 2014: An article titled "Asymptomatic course and resolution of progressive multifocal 
leukoencephalopathy (PML) during natalizumab therapy with pre-emptive treatment for immune reconstitution 
inflammatory syndrome (IRIS)" written by W Xu, MJ Pedrini, J Burton, WM Carroll, AG Kermode and published in 
Multiple Sclerosis Journal 2014 (20: (7) 901 960) reported that a 40 year old patient on TYSABRI experienced 
asymptomatic PML detected on regular MRI screening.  The patient had a history of aggressive inflammatory MS, 
prior mitoxantrone therapy, Stratify JCV test positivity, and 5 years of natalizumab monotherapy which was highly 
effective in controlling her disease. The patient underwent CSF testing leading to diagnosis and early intervention 
as well as pre-emptive treatment for IRIS with high dose IV followed by oral corticosteroids, as well as empirical 
mirtazapine and mefloquine as suggested by in-vitro studies.  No other information was provided.
Update 16 Mar 2015: Additional information was received from the neurologist via a MS Standardized PML Data 
Collection Tool. The patient is alive. On 08 Mar 2015, the neurologist assessed the patient's estimated Karnofsky 
and EDSS scores to be 70 (cares for self; unable to carry on normal activity or to do active work) and 6.5, 
respectively. As of 04 Feb 2015, the patient had recovered from PML and had recovered from IRIS. Causality of the
event of PML was  assessed as related to TYSABRI.
Update 09 Nov 2015 and 13 Nov 2015: Additional information was received via literature (abstract and the 
corresponding article): Asymptomatic progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy during natalizumab therapy with

relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis in 1996.  Previous MS therapy included subcutaneous interferon beta 1 b, 
intravenous methylprednisolone (IVMP), mitoxantrone followed by ongoing interferon therapy. Since other disease 
modifying agents were ineffective, concurrent with the development of a tumefactive lesion accompanied by status 
epilepticus and EDSS score of 6.0, the patient started on natalizumab. MRIs performed every 6 months were 
unchanged for the following 54 months and she remained stable and relapse free. In Aug 2011, the patient was 
JCV antibody positive. In Feb 2013, a PML surveillance MRI showed subtle patchy signal change in the left cerebral
peduncle and pons. CSF examination in Feb 2013 confirmed JCV DNA presence. The leukocyte count was 
0x10^6/L and proteins were 0.44 g/L. The patient was admitted to hospital and received 5 session of 
plasmapheresis with addition of mefloquine, mirtazapine 15 mg, IVMP 500 mg daily for 5 days, then continued 
mirtazapine, prednisolone 50 mg/kg orally and weekly mefloquine 250 mg. Repeat CSF JCV PCR was 63,910 
copies/mL but leukocyte count was 0x10^6/L with proteins 0.33 g/L. The oral prednisolone was reduced to 37.5 mg 
after 3 weeks then to 25 mg after 5 weeks. MRI dated Mar 2013 showed interval resolution of the previously 
demonstrated enhancing foci. MRI dated Apr 2013 showed several existing brain stem and cerebral lesions and 
subtle enhancement suspicious for IRIS. MRI dated 2013 showed interval development of multiple new areas of 
signal abnormality and faint nodular enhancement. In Aug 2013, prednisolone had tapered to 6.25 mg. CSF JCV 
DNA returned 30 copies/mL. In Oct 2013, the patient felt more unbalanced but could still walk with a single elbow 
crutch. MRI dated Oct 2013 showed extensive multiple new enhancing foci in the supratentorial and infratentorial 
compartments, suggestive of active MS. IVMP treatment resulted in rapid improvement. CSF JCV was 
undetectable. Following steroid treatment, dimethyl fumarate therapy was started. MRIs dated Dec 2013, Jan 2014,
and Jul 2014 showed interval improvement with resolution of enhancement and reduction in lesion T2 volumes. 
EDSS remained at 6.0 in Aug 2011, Feb 2012, Aug 2012, Feb 2013, Mar 2013, Apr 2013, May 2013, Aug 2013, 
Oct 2013, Dec 2013, Jan 2014 and Jul 2014.
