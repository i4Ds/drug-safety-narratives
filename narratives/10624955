Medically Significant
A neurologist spontaneously reported that a female patient on TYSABRI (300 mg, IV, QM) for Multiple Sclerosis 
from unknown date to unknown date (37 infusions) was under evaluation for suspect PML (onset unknown), severe
cognitive impairment (onset unknown), aphasic (onset unknown), right decreasing hemiparesis (onset unknown), 
and low trunk control (onset unknown). MRI performed on 20-Nov-2014 showed new wide parenchymal areas of 
altered signal, cortical-subcortical, long TR hyperintense in a disomogeneous manner, involving the frontal regions 
of bith sides and the left parietal-temporal-occipital area. The base nuclei and the left mesencephalon were 
involved as well. After Gd administration, multiple and diffused enhancing area appeared, punticform and ring like. 
The described picture led to PML suspicion. At the reporting time the patient showed a severe cognitive

impairment, barely cooperative, showing difficulties when executing even the simplest requests.  The patient was 
aphasic and showed a right decreasing hemiparesis and a low trunk control. On both sides Doupree signs (NOS) 
were observed.  The patient had no previous immunosuppressant exposure.
Update 12 Dec 2014: Follow-up information was received from a physician via a suspect PML data collection form. 
The suspect product was confirmed as TYSABRI (300 mg, every 28-30 days).  TYSABRI stop date was 04 Aug 
2014.  The patient experienced an interruption of the suspect product, for greater than 3 months, from 04 Mar 2011
to 04 Aug 2014 due to no response. Prior to suspected PML, MS disease symptoms included cognitive/behavioral, 
motor, cerebellar, and focal seizure. The patient has not received prior immunosuppressant therapy. Previous 
immunomodulatory therapy included Avonex (interferon beta-1a).  On 11 Aug 2011, serum anti-JCV antibody status
was positive (index value not provided).
The patient was being evaluated for PML due to clinical signs and symptoms.  Signs and symptoms included 
memory and attention deficits (onset 01 Oct 2014), right hemiparesis (onset not provided), aphasia (onset not 
provided), and focal seizure (onset not provided). MRI prior to suspected PML was performed on 04 Nov 2014 
(results not provided).  MRI at the time of suspected PML was performed on 20 Nov 2014.  Lumbar puncture was 
performed on 21 Nov 2014 and tested positive for CSF JCV DNA at 64 copies/ml ((b) (6)  laboratory).  The 
physician informed that the patient tested positive for the presence of JCV DNA in the CSF sample sent to (b) (6)  
labs.  Brain biopsy has not been performed.  At the time of PML suspicion (pre-PLEX), on (b) (6)  leukocyte 
count was 7.3x10(3)/mm3 (reference range 4.0-10.0), lymphocyte count was 13.9%, and absolute lymphocyte 
count was 1.02x10(3)/mm3.  CSF analysis on 21 Nov 2014 was normal.  The patient has not received treatment 
with plasma exchange (PLEX).  PML treatment included mefloquine, mirtazapine, corticosteroids, and aciclovir. The
patient is currently hospitalized. PML is still under investigation, the patient has recovered, and the event has been 
assessed as related to TYSABRI.
Update 12 Dec 2014: Follow-up information was received via the National Pharmacovigilance Network (ID: 
284290). The events included PML with progressive motor and cognitive deficits (onset 24 Oct 2014) which have 
not yet resolved. TYSABRI was administered from 04 Mar 2014 to 04 Aug 2014; after discontinuation, the patient's 
condition improved. TYSABRI was not resumed at the reporting time.
Update 16 Dec 2014: Follow-up information from a physician clarified that TYSABRI was started on 04 Mar 2011 
(date of first administration) and regularly administrated up to 04 Aug 2014 (date of last administration).
Update 18 Dec 2014: Biogen Idec considers this case confirmed for PML based on positive CSF, consistent 
radiologic findings, and clinical symptoms.
Update 07 Jan 2015: Follow-up information was received from the National Pharmacovigilance Network.  The

patient's date of birth was corrected from (b) (6)  to (b) (6)  The patient was hospitalized several times, 
the last one on (b) (6)  with discharge on (b) (6)  with an improvement of general clinical conditions.  On 
(b) (6)  the patient developed facial muscle contracture with locked mouth, tremor of the head and diffuse 
rigidity without loss of consciousness. These episodes lasted about 2 minutes. About 2 hours later, a new similar 
episode occurred, so the patient presented to the emergency room and was admitted to the neurology department. 
During hospitalization, two brain MRIs with CM revealed no regions of phatologiacal hypercadtation.  An EEG was 
performed that lead to the introduction of the treatment with Vimpat (lacosamide) and Tolep (topiramate). The 
patient was then admitted to the rehabilitation department.  She was discharged on (b) (6)  upon her 
[presume, the patient's] request, and on the same day she was re-admitted to a neurology center.
Update 11 Mar 2015: Additional information was received from a physician via a MS Standardized PML Data 
Collection Tool. The patient's height and weight at the time of PML diagnosis was 150 cm and 46 kg, respectively. 
The patient was diagnosed with IRIS (determining factors not reported). Treatment for IRIS included 
methylprednisolone 2 GM IV daily from 23 Nov 2014 to 29 Nov 2014; methylprednisolone 1 GM IV daily from 30 
Nov 2014 to 06 Dec 2014; and prednisone 25 mg by mouth daily from 07 Dec 2014 to 04 Feb 2015. As of 27 Feb 
2015, the patient had recovered from PML. At the time of this report, the patient was alive and had recovered from 
IRIS. The causality of the event of PML was assessed as related to TYSABRI; causality of the event of IRIS to 
TYSABRI was not reported.
Update 10 Apr 2015: Additional information was received from a physician via a Standardized MS PML Data 
Collection Tool. On 04 Mar 2011, the patient's EDSS score was 4.0. On (b) (6)  the patient's estimated 
Karnofsky and EDSS scores were 40 (disabled; requires special care and assistance) and 5.0. On (b) (6)
the patient's estimated Karnofsky and EDSS scores were 20 (very sick; hospital admission necessary; active 
supportive treatment necessary) and 8.0. On(b) (6)  the patient's estimated Karnofsky score was 20. The 
diagnosis of IRIS was determined by clinical symptoms and MRI findings. Symptoms included seizure (onset Oct 
2014), and cognitive/behavioral, motor, and speech symptoms with onset date of (b) (6)  At the time of this 
report, the patient was alive and was in the hospital. She has recovered from PML (as of (b) (6) ) and has 
recovered from IRIS. The causality of the event of PML was assessed as related to TYSABRI; causality of the 
event of IRIS to TYSABRI was not reported.
Update 10 Jun 2015: Additional information was received from a physician via a Standardized MS PML Data 
Collection Tool.  The diagnosis of IRIS was determined by clinical symptoms and MRI findings. Symptoms included
seizure, cognitive/behavioral, motor, and speech symptoms (onsets (b) (6) ). The patient did receive 
corticosteroids post-IRIS onset. The patient received the following treatment for IRIS: methylprednisolone (2 gram, 
IV, QD) from 23 Nov 2014 to 29 Nov 2014; methylprednisolone (1 gram, IV, QD) from 30 Nov 2014 to 06 Dec 2014;
and prednisone (25 mg, PO, QD) from 07 Dec 2014 to 04 Feb 2015.  The patient's most recent brain MRI was on

18 Feb 2015 (results not provided). On (b) (6)  the patient's estimated Karnofsky and EDSS scores were 40 
(disabled; requires special care and assistance) and 7.0. At the time of this report, the patient was alive, not 
currently on another therapy for MS, and was in the hospital. She has recovered from PML (date not provided) and 
has recovered from IRIS (as of (b) (6) ). The causality of the events of PML and IRIS was assessed as 
related to TYSABRI.
Update 02 Dec 2015: Additional information was received from a neurologist via a MS Standardized PML Data 
Collection Tool. At the time of this report, the patient was alive, not currently on another therapy for MS, and was in 
the hospital. The most recent MRI was performed on (b) (6)  and showed no significant enhancement.  The 
estimated Karnofsky and EDSS scores were assessed on (b) (6)  to be 40 (disabled; requires special care 
and assistance) and 7.5, respectively. The patient was assessed on (b) (6)  to be recovered with sequelae 
from the events of PML and IRIS (discrepant information).
