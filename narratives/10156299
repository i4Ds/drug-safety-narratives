Gold R, et al. The CSF JCV antibody index for diagnosis of natalizumab-associated PML. Running title: Potential 
implications for PML case definition. Annals of Neurology. 2014 APR 11  doi: 10.1002/ana.24153. Ahead of print 
(not yet published). An unidentified patient on Tysabri for MS was diagnosed with PML.  The patient's CSF was 
positive for JCV DNA at 6930 copies/ mL.  The patient's anti-JCV antibody index in the CSF was 0.52. The 
outcome of PML is unknown. The causality for PML was assessed as related. No further information was provided.
Update 15 Sep 2014: Follow-up attempts with the authors were unsuccessful. Upon internal review, Biogen Idec 
considers this case to be final call as a high suspect PML case.
Update 20 Nov 2014: Information was received via the literature: Warnke C., Stettner M., Lehmensick V., et al.

Natalizumab exerts a suppressive effect on surrogates of B cell function in blood and CSF. Multiple Sclerosis 
Journal.  Published online 12 November 2014.  The authors aimed to assess the effect of natalizumab on cellular 
composition and functional B cell parameters including 37 patients with natalizumab-associated PML.  IgG levels in 
blood and CSF were available from the 37 patients, of which 20 were first sampled at time of diagnosis as defined 
by a first positive PCR for JCV DNA in CSF.  Patients with natalizumab-associated PML were 28-63 years old 
(average 45), 68% were female, and the treatment duration was 19-75 months (average 44).  The authors 
concluded that natalizumab impacts B and T cell distribution and exerts an inhibitory effect on surrogates of B cell 
function in periphery and in cerebrospinal fluid, potentially contributing to the increased risk of developing PML. This
case refers to one of the 37 patients with natalizumab-associated PML. No new information was reported on this 
patient.
