A neurologist reported that a 52 year old male patient on TYSABRI (300 mg, IV, QM) for Multiple Sclerosis from 01 
Apr 2008 to 06 Feb 2014 and enrolled in a Biogen Idec sponsored marketing program of Monitored Therapy was 
under investigation for PML (onset 17 Feb 2014). The patient started showing signs including confusion, trouble 
with vision in the last week, and she put a shoe on backwards. At the time of this report, the TOUCH database 
indicated the patient received a total of 72 doses of TYSABRI from 01 Apr 2008 to 06 Feb 2014.  Previous testing 
included positive JCV antibody in Aug 2011. The patient had an MRI on Friday and CSS (cerebrospinal fluid) was 
obtained and results are pending. The physician advised they are going to start plasma exchange. Previous 
treatment for MS included Avonex and Rebif. The event of under investigation for PML is ongoing. The causality for
the event of under investigation for PML was assessed as related.  TYSABRI therapy was discontinued.
Update 26 Feb 2014: Follow-up was received from the neurologist in response to an outbound phonecall.  The 
neurologist thinks that if this is PML, it was caught early.  The patient presented with visual quadranopsia, regional 
focal area on MRI (not diffuse).  The patient was hospitalized over the weekend and started on PLEX on (b) (6)  
(b) (6)  and will receive 5 treatments.  CSF was sent to (b) (6)  for testing (results pending) and the neurologist 
informed he would provide some of the MRI images.
Update 28 Feb 2014: Follow-up received from the neurologist in response to an outbound request included office 
visit notes for the patient.  During a visit on 11 Apr 2013, the patient was noted to have urinary frequency and 
incontinence for which he was prescribed tamsulosin and the symptoms resolved.  The patient was also noted to 
have a history of facial pain which was treated with gabapentin as needed.  The patient's wife noted his balance 
had been a little more off over the past several weeks and his upper extremity coordination had been somewhat 
worse.  The patient was noted to be relatively stable on TYSABRI, doing much better than on multiple prior 
medications, and the preference was to continue.  The next scheduled office visit occurred on 15 Aug 2013.  The 
facial/mouth pain had been in remission for several months and the urinary symptoms had improved such that he 
was no longer taking the tamsulosin.  The patient's wife noted that his gait is sometimes a little more unsteady than 
usual and he appears inattentive or sluggish but that was not anything new.  During a physical exam, the patient 
was noted to have a wide-based gait and require the use of a walker, but was able to take a few steps 
independently.  The patient was noted to be relatively stable on TYSABRI, doing much better than on multiple prior 
medications, and the preference was to continue.  The next scheduled office visit occurred on 05 Dec 2013.  The 
patient's wife noted that the patient's balance had worsened over the past few weeks and he uses a walker when 
he goes out.  During a physical exam, the patient was noted to have extremely wide-based gait and could ambulate
with assistance.  The neurologist noted that he did not believe the patient's gait unsteadiness was much different 
from baseline.  The patient was noted to be relatively stable on TYSABRI, doing much better than on multiple prior 
medications, and the preference was to continue.  JCV DNA PCR testing was performed by the (b) (6)  on a CSF 
sample collected on(b) (6)  with a result of 102 copies per milliliter which was consistent with PML.

Update 05 Mar 2014: The neurologist provided MRI images (as jpegs) for this patient; however, the MRI report was
not provided. 
Update 06 Mar 2014: Upon internal review, Biogen Idec considers this case to be confirmed for PML based on the 
clinical symptoms, positive CSF, and MRI findings.
Update 02 Apr 2014: During an inbound phone call, the neurologist requested assistance in MRI review as he is 
questioning if subtle changes on the MRI represent worsening PML or early-onset IRIS.
Update 02 May 2014: The neurologist reported the patient was readmitted to the hospital on (b) (6)  for 
suspected worsening IRIS.  A repeat MRI was performed that night and the patient was scheduled for a follow-up 
MRI (on 02 May 2014).
Update 28 May 2014: The spouse of the male patient on TYSABRI spontaneously reported that the patient 
experienced PML (onset 2014). The spouse also noted that the patient experienced "left-side swelling, patient 
doesn't realize he has a left side, patient unable to process objects in vision, unable to walk, and fidgety" (onset 
2014; presumed symptoms of PML). The reporter stated that the symptoms started approximately three months 
ago, at the end of Feb 2014 or the beginning of March 2014. The reporter noted that the patient was hospitalized 
for three months and is "currently in rehab." Testing and treatment were not provided. The event PML is ongoing. 
Causality was not provided by the spouse. TYSABRI therapy was discontinued.
Update 19 Jun 2014: The patient's wife spontaneously reported "TYSABRI turned toxic" (onset date 
unknown;patient previously diagnosed with PML) and the patient could not see, walk, go to the bathroom, feed 
himself, hold a regular conversation or acknowledge anything on his left side, had slurred speech, and swelling on 
his brain. The patient was hospitalized for 2 months in(b) (6)   and was treated with PLEX, "solventry 
autoimmune medication", and 16 mg Solumedrol. He was then transferred to rehab on(b) (6)  Additionally, 
the patient's wife reported that prior to "TYSABRI turned toxic" the patient experienced falls (onset dates unknown) 
and some relapses (presumed MS, onset dates unknown). Additional information is expected.
Update 01 Dec 2014: Additional information was received from the neurologist via a MS Standardized PML Data 
Collection Tool. The patient died on (b) (6) . The reported cause of death was aspiration pneumonia (onset 
unknown). An autopsy was not performed. Reported Karnofsky and EDSS scores on 08 Nov 2014 were 0 (dead) 
and 10. A brain MRI was performed on 09 Oct 2014 (results not provided). On 07 Oct 2014, lymphocyte count was 
11.2 % (normal range 13.0 - 44.0 %) and absolute lymphocyte count was 1.1 K/microliter (normal range 1.0 - 3.3 
K/microliter). Leukocyte count on 30 Oct 2014 was 11.8 K/microliter (normal range 3.8 to 10.5 K/microliter). The 
patient was diagnosed with IRIS, which was determined by clinical symptoms and MRI findings. The onset date of

clinical symptoms was 01 Apr 2014 and included difficulty following directions (cognitive/behavioral) and increased 
gait ataxia and recurrent falls (cerebellar). The patient did not receive corticosteroids pre-IRIS onset, but did receive
corticosteroids post-IRIS onset. Treatment for IRIS included maraviroc 300 mg PO BID from 10 Mar 2014 to 31 Oct
2014; methylprednisolone 500 mg IV every 12 hours from 03 Apr 2014 to 08 Apr 2014; and dexamethasone 16 mg 
tapered to 6 mg, given daily in divided doses PO and IV from 09 Apr 2014 to 08 Nov 2014. As of 08 Nov 2014, the 
patient had not recovered from PML and IRIS. Causality for the fatal event of aspiration pneumonia as well as the 
events of PML and IRIS was assessed as related to TYSABRI.
