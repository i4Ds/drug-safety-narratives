This solicited report was initially received from a consumer (patient) in the United States on 09-Jun-2014. Additional
information was received on 10-Jun-2014. Follow-up information was received from a health care professional 
(nurse) on 23-Jun-2014 via Acorda Affiliate Biogen Idec (2014BI061601). Follow-up information was received from 
a consumer (patient) on 10-Jul-2014 via Acorda Affiliate Biogen Idec  (2014BI061601). Follow-up information was 
received from Acorda QA on 09-Mar-2015. A female patient, 50 years of age at the time of the report, with multiple 
sclerosis (MS) experienced being positive for John Cunningham Virus (JCV) antibodies (medically significant), 
illness progressing/aggressive MS /brain damage, heavy vaginal bleeding, urinary tract infections, decreased dose 
to one pill per day, and felt Ampyra was not helping with walking while taking Ampyra. She also reported that the 
medication has been helping with transfers/stability.
The patient's past medical history included MS diagnosed in 1996 (previously reported as 1996 or 1998), 
decreased thyroid function, increased cholesterol, neurogenic bladder with Foley catheter and 21 Botox bladder 
injections, constipation, benign polyp in urethra, and vaginal bleeding. She had been treated for MS with interferon 
via infusion from 1998-2000 (discontinued due to lack of effect). Concomitant medications at onset included 
Gilenya 0.5 mg, Fluoxetine 40 mg, Citalopram 10 mg, Baclofen 10 mg, Levothyroxine Sodium 125 mcg, 
Acetaminophen, Advil, Vitamin D 2000 IU, and Vitamin C 500 mg. Additional dosing information and indications 
were not provided.
Ampyra (fampridine) was started on an unspecified date in 2010 at 10 mg twice daily to improve walking MS. In 
2012, the dosage was decreased to 10 mg daily because of frequent urinary tract infections. Tysabri was reported 
as a co-suspect medication, starting on an unspecified date in 2001 (also reported as 2002) for multiple sclerosis. 
On an unspecified date, the patient was advised she is PML positive. Her physician is concerned that she may have
PML. She has undergone MRIs (dates unknown) and has been advised that she has a very aggressive form of MS 
and that she "probably had lifelong MS." She stated comparisons between recent and previous MRIs showed 
progression of disease. She has brain damage with two holes in her brain due to the illness progression. She noted
she has had very heavy vaginal bleeding for approximately one month. She was seen in the emergency room 07-
Jun-2014 - 08-Jun-2014 for the bleeding. At that time, her vaginal ultrasound was normal and her hematocrit and 
hemoglobin were "fine" (nos). She will be following up with her gynecologist for further care (ablation therapy versus
hysterectomy). She states the vaginal bleeding has improved. She stated Ampyra dose was decreased (from 10 
mg twice daily to 10 mg qd) in 2012 due to frequent urinary tract infections. Further information was not provided 
regarding the urinary tract infections. The patient stated she had previously been able to walk, then used a brace 
and walker. She stated Ampyra has not been helping with walking. At present, she does not walk and transfers 
from chair to chair. She states Ampyra helps with her transfers/stability. Upon follow-up received on 23-Jun-2014, a
nurse reported that the patient was not being worked up for PML. The patient tested positive for JCV antibodies in 
Nov-2013 (index of 0.34). The nurse stated that she did not know why the patient would state she was positive for

PML. She reported that the patient must have confused positive for JCV antibodies to mean positive for PML, but 
the patient was not positive for PML. The nurse stated that the patient had an appointment the following day (24-
Jun-2014) and she would explain to the patient the difference between the two. The nurse reported that the patient 
remains on Gilenya. Additionally, the nurse reported that the patient was trying to obtain a prescription to take only 
10 mg of Ampyra per day, but the nurse stated she would not do this, as it was not approved by the FDA at this 
dose. No additional information was provided. Upon follow-up received on 10-Jul-2014, the patient reported that 
Ampyra has not been helping with her walking while taking 10 mg orally once daily. No further information was 
provided. Follow-up information received from Acorda QA on 09-Mar-2015 provided provided QA analysis results. 
The outcome of the vaginal bleeding is recovering. The outcome of the remaining events is unknown.
Ampyra dose was reduced (2012) and continues. Tysabri dose was withdrawn (2013). 
The reporter (patient) did not assess the relationship between Ampyra and the events. The nurse did not provide a 
causality assessment.
Upon final analysis by Acorda QA, the bulk tablet lot number had in-specification results for both dissolution and 
uniformity of dosage units and no bulk process deviation or OOS investigation that impacted the releasability of the 
lot.  Therefore, the patient complaint of no or less effect from Ampyra therapy is not attributable to product quality 
created in tablet manufacture.
Follow-up information received from a health care professional (nurse) on 23-Jun-2014 via Acorda Affiliate Biogen 
Idec provided clarification that the patient was positive for JCV antibodies, not positive for PML. The event of PML 
positive has been removed from the report. The patient remained on Gilenya. This information has been 
incorporated into the narrative.
Follow-up information received from a consumer (patient) on 10-Jul-2014 via Acorda Affiliate Biogen Idec provided 
MS diagnosis date as 1996 and a repeated report of Ampyra has not been helping with her walking while taking 10 
mg orally once daily. This information has been incorporated into the narrative. On this follow-up, this case was 
changed to non-serious.
Follow-up information received from Acorda QA on 09-Mar-2015 provided provided QA analysis results. This 
information has been incorporated into the narrative.
