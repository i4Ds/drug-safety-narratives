clinical trial case , reported by an investigator via a subsidiary company (manufacturer number 
07-02- /protocol , regards a 74-year-old Caucasian male. Medical history was significant for non- 
small cell lung cancer metastatic, pneumonia, bronchitis, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, dyspnea, and coronary 
artery disease. He was taking multiple concomitant medications including celecoxib and supplementation with folic 
add; it was not provided if she received vitamin B12. At baseline, it was also noted that he received a course of 
moxifloxacin from 09Jan07 to 16Jan07 for bronchitis and prednisone from 16Jan07 to 28Jan07 for cough. On 
31Jan07, the patient first and last received pemetrexed disodium (Alimta), 900 rng intravenously (IV), in 
combination with cetuximab, 720 mg IV, for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer metastatic (frequency was 
not pro ). On lipiedays after last receiving pemetrexed and cetuximab, the patient arrived to the 
oncology clinic to re  scheduled cetuximab treatment. He presented with grade 3 dyspnea and an oxygen 
saturation of 88-90%. A chest x-ray revealed pneumonia. He was subsequently hospitalized to receive IV 
antibiotics (piperacillin/tazobactam, ciprofloxacin) and oxygen therapy. Study treatment was held due to the event. 
On11111.111, the patient became hypotensive and severely hypoxemic, at which time he was transferred to the 
intensive care unit for ventilation support due to sepsis (substantiating laboratory values were not provided). On the 
same day (411111., cardiac enzymes were shown to be increased indicating myocardial infarct (considered 
medically significant) which the investigator deemed related to the sepsis. Treatment for the sepsis included 
vancomycin IV, hydrocortisone, and treatment for the myocardial infarction included norepinephrine and 
dobutamine. He also developed grade 2 oliguria (non serious) and was treated with furosemide IV. After 
discussion with the family, the decision was made not to increase patient's treatment. On11111111110the patient 
died. The cause of death was reported as pneumonia and septic shock (investigator considered sepsis and septic 
shock the same event). An autopsy was not performed. The myocardial infarct was ongoing at the time of death. 
In the opinion of the investigator, the fatal pneumonia (grade 4) and the fatal sepsis (grade 4) were definitely related 
to pemetrexed and possibly related to cetuximab. The medically significant myocardial infarct related to sepsis 
(grade 4) was unlikely related to pemetrexed and cetuximab. Protocol procedures were not assessed. Update 
18Aug2011: Upon review on 18Aug2011, as a part of cetuximab case migration, noted that link attached was for 
incorrect TN number. Appropriate link attached for TN 91283. No changes to case information. Update 16-Sep-
2011: Upon review on the 15-Sep-2011; it was determined that case 07-02-11236 is a duplicate of this report;
