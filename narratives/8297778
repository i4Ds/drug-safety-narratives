The mother's medical history included partial onset seizure, asthma, headache, anemia and Rh immunization. 
Concomitantly the mother was on folic acid, trazodone, Tylenol (paracetamol), prenatal vitamin, Pepcid AC 
(famotidine) and ferrous sulfate.
This report concerned a one among the twin male baby (Baby B) in the United States who exposed to Keppra XR 
(levetiracetam extended release) 3000 mg daily transplacentally since 0 week of gestation and throughout 
pregnancy. The mother received levetiracetam orally for epilepsy and seizure disorder.  Mother's LMP was (b) (6)
 Mother was 30-year-old at the time of conception.
On (b) (6)  the baby was born pre-maturely at 36 weeks of gestation. The baby weight was 2.99 kgs (6.6 
pounds) and APGAR score was 9 at 1 minute and was 9 at 5 min.  No birth defect reported in baby.
On 09-Feb-2012 follow-up information was received from a pediatric health care professional.
The baby's initials were updated. He had been breastfed for the first 2 months. At birth the baby's height was 49.5 
cm and head circumference was 33.5 cm.
At the 6 months follow-up baby B was developing normally for his age.  His height was 77.47 cm and head 
circumference was 45.085. His weight was 9.3kg. 
New relevant information from the AED registry was received by UCB on 18-Jul-2012.
In 2011, at 2 months of age, baby was noted to have palmer crease (single) and mildly abnormal face.
Other factors that might have contributed to this outcome were unknown. The baby had regular chromosomes 
considered normal and was having genetic work up.
On (b) (6)  the neonate was examined at 12 months of age.
As per the report, baby was developing normally for his age. His weight was 10.48 kg and was 81.915 cm in height.

FOIA Case Report Information
New relevant information from the AED registry was received by UCB on 30-Jul-2012.
At 12 months age of assessment, the event of mildly abnormal facies was given a non-specific description as 
"deviation from family standard". It was counted by Metropolitan Atlanta Congenital Defects Program (MACDP) as a
defect.
It was reported that the development of mild abnormal facies and the timing of the exposure to drug cannot rule out
a possible association.
New relevant information was received from the investigator by UCB via the AED registry on 27-Sep-2012.
The patient's assessment at 12 months of age showed chromosomes within normal limits. The genetic evaluation 
showed no need for further work up. There was normal motor and verbal development and growth.
New relevant information was received by UCB on 05-Jul-2013 via the (b) (6)
The child's assessment at 24 months of age on 25-Jun-2013 showed his weight was 13 kgs (28 pounds 08 oz) and 
height was 89.9 centimeters (35.4 inches).
The child was developing normally at its age.
The nurse confirmed that there were no defects noted at the 2 year visit for the child.
New relevant information was received by UCB from a physician on 13-Aug-2014 via the (b) (6)
The child's assessment at 36 months of age on 17-Jun-2014 showed his weight was 14.51 kgs (32 pounds) and 
height was 96 centimeters (37.75 inches).
The child was developing normally at its age.
Other factors that might have contributed to single palmar crease was familial (sister: not twin).
It was unknown if the defect of single palmar creases was attributed to UCB AED therapy.
On 18-Aug-2015, upon internal review, case was reopened and the event of "palmar crease (single)" was deleted 
from the database, as it was captured inadvertently for the Baby B

FOIA Case Report Information
On 11-Mar-2016, case was reopened and the event of dysmorphism was removed and replaced by palmar crease 
(single).  This is a minor malformation of the palmar creasing patterns that derives from hand position in utero .
Associated cases: 039270 (mother-child pair), and 047556 (sibling).
