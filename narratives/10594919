Medically Significant
The below information is a case summary from 24 Sep 2014 to 23 Dec 2014:
A 34 year old female with MS from Italy was diagnosed with PML following 58 infusions of TYSABRI from 16 Dec 
2009 to 27 Aug 2014. Her MS was diagnosed in Apr 2009 but her first MS symptoms occurred since she was 9 
years old. The patient has no history of IS use and was previously on Betaseron from May 2009 to Dec 2009. She 
tested anti-JCV Ab positive with index of >1.5 and is HIV negative. EDSS pre-PML was stable at 4.5 (date 
assessed unknown). During TYSABRI therapy the patient's clinical condition was stable, apart from a relapse 
treated with steroids (NOS).

On 01 Sep 2014, the patient started experiencing blurred vision on the right eye. An eye exam showed right lateral 
homonymous hemianopsia with partial improvement after IV steroids administration. Brain MRI from (b) (6)
compared to the prior exam from Jun 2014, showed multiple hyperintense lesions in the white matter in the both 
hemispheres without any contrast enhancement. The patient was hospitalized for a lumbar puncture to exclude 
PML. CSF JCV results were pending.
In (b) (6)  (after hospital discharge), the patient reported by phone the onset of intentional tremor of the left 
superior limb. Due to the clinical worsening, the patient was hospitalized again on (b) (6)  to perform a new 
evaluation. A new brain MRI was performed on (b) (6)  while waiting for the CSF JCV DNA (b) (6)  results, 
because the initial PML hypothesis had become more solid. The brain MRI with contrast medium on (b) (6)
indicated (in comparison with the previous examination) two white matter focal alterations were found in the left 
frontal-supraventricular and periventricular areas. At the imaging in diffusion, evidence of an increase more 
significant at the level of the focal alterations described above and in the left temporal cortico-subcortal area. No 
evidence of enhancement after contrast medium administration. At the objective neurologic examination performed 
at hospital admission, the following was observed: patient awake, cooperative, oriented; no deficit of cranial nerves;
occasional anomy; ataxic instability with intentional tremor on the left at the Mingazzini test of the superior limbs; 
early delevelling bilaterally right >left, with ataxic instability; vivid and polykinetic osteotendineal reflexes of the 4 
limbs; cutaneous plantar reflex Babinski bilateral; standing at enlarged basis;  parapareto-ataxic gait, autonomous 
for about 200 metres, severe neurogenic bladder for strong incontinency and urinary retention (intermittent 8-10 
catheters in 24 hours). SF: P 3; C 3; TE 0; S 1; V 2; M 3; Sf 4; A 2. The patient's EDSS = 5.0.
On (b) (6)  at 8:30 am, the patient suddenly experienced a generalized epileptic seizure lasted more than 5 
minutes, followed by a similar seizure, and then by partial crisis with head and eyes deviated to the right and clonia 
of the whole right hemisome, without recovering consciousness. For this reason a brain CT-scan was performed, 
which was negative for hemorrhages. A resuscitation counselling was made. IV Valium (diazepam) was 
administered, without recovering consciousness. At 11:40 am, phenytoin 750 mg/250 ml was administered IV over 
1 hour, without any complications but also without recovering consciousness. At 2 pm an EEG was performed and 
it showed electro-clinic damage with left fronto-temporal area focus, therefore the patient was moved to the 
resuscitation department where a barbiturate (tiopentone) coma protocol was performed, as per international 
guidelines (burst-suppression). The burst suppression status daily EEG monitoring was performed and 
concomitantly the dosage of tiopentone was adjusted. The burst suppression was discontinued on (b) (6)  but
the patient was kept in a coma induced by barbiturates up to (b) (6)  (11 days). Then a gradual recovering 
consciousness occurred and the patient was moved to the Neurology unit on (b) (6)  Starting from (b) (6)  
(b) (6)  therapy with Dintoina (phenytoin) was started at the dose of 400 mg/day, with continuous plasmatic 
monitoring. The following EEG showed a progressive improvement of the pattern that from an initial delta rhythm 
went back to an occipital alpha rhythm, with gradual and simultaneous decrease of the irritative activity that was

(b) (6)  at this time (CSF collected back in Sep 2014) and the PML diagnosis was confirmed. 
EEG results were provided for the following dates:(b) (6)  recording of a status of electro-clinic damage in 
the left hemisphere, with foci in the fronto-temporal area; (b) (6)  at 11 am: patient under tiopentone 
treatment due to mal seizure. Picture of initial burst suppression;(b) (6)  at 6 am: picture of optimal burst 
suppression; (b) (6)  the picture of burst suppression persists; (b) (6)  check after tiopentone 
discontinuation. slow-wave activity at 4 to 6 Hz, with residual burst-suppression like characteristics. Presence of 
isolated cusp anomalies or in short sequence, sometimes with feature of spike or slow-wave spike of atypical type. 
Conclusions: activity of irritative meaning prevalent in the fronto-temporal region, mainly at the left side; (b) (6)  
(b) (6)  pattern characterized by slow activity up to 3-4 Hz, continue e diffuse without apparent asymmetries; 
recording of cusp complexes with feature of slow spike-wave on the left hemispheric derivations mainly fronto-
temporal; (b) (6)  background activity at 4-6 Hz, slower on the left with absence of activity of irritative 
meaning. No longer signs of burst-suppression. One episode of appearance, at the left fronto-temporal, of 
elements like spike-wave associated to wide opening of the eyes, lasting a few seconds; (b) (6)  occipital 
alpha rhythm at 7.5-8 Hz, subdominant and symmetric on the right, wider and mixed to spiked activity on the left, 
poorly responding to the eyes opening. Over voltage sequences in the theta band, irregular, cusp shape, in the left 
fronto-temporal area. Conclusions: activity of irritative meaning in the left fronto-temporal area; (b) (6)
pattern clearly improved in comparison with the previous examination.  Abnormalities of paroxistic meaning persist 
in the left fronto-temporal area; (b) (6)  alpha-occipital rhythm at 10 Hz, 20-40 microV of extension, 
subdominant and symmetric, poorly responding to the eyes opening. Irregular theta sequences, sometimes cusp 
shape, in the left fronto-temporal area. No significant changes of the pattern during hyperpnea and Stimulation Light
Intermittent. Conclusions: moderate abnormalities of irritative meaning in the left fronto-temporal area.
Repeat brain MRI from (b) (6)  showed a clear increase in size of the areas of signal alteration located in the 
subcortical white matter, in both hemispheres, with a greater involvement of the U-shaped fibres of the right 
temporal lobe, in the polar anterior area, of the left temporal lobe (latero-posterior) and of both frontal lobes (antero-
basal gyri and circonvolution frontal up to right, superior gyrus and middle at the left. After contrast medium 
administration, in such multiple areas, badly defined, wide areas of "open ring" enhancement mainly peripheral 
were found, suggestive of an ongoing inflammatory demyelinating process with alteration of the blood-brain barrier. 
Such finding, according to clinical data, anamnesis and lab data, seemed to be suggestive of PML-IRIS. 
On (b) (6)  the patient came out of the barbiturate-induced coma. At the time of this report, the patient did not
have any respiratory problems and no longer showed evidence of abnormal brain electric activity on her EEG that 
was recorded after the seizures and made the pharmacological treatment necessary. At the time of this report, the 
patient showed a complete aphasia (presumed symptom of event suspect PML) consistent with the encephalic

area affected by the lesion. 
A brain MRI from (b) (6)  showed a clear increase in size of the areas of signal alteration located in the 
subcortical white matter, in both hemispheres, with a greater involvement of the U-shaped fibres of the right 
temporal lobe, in the polar anterior area, of the left temporal lobe (latero-posterior) and of both frontal lobes (antero-
basal gyri and circonvolution frontal up to right, superior gyrus and middle at the left. After contrast medium 
administration, in such multiple areas, badly defined, wide areas of "open ring" enhancement mainly peripheral 
were found, suggestive of an ongoing inflammatory demyelinating process with alteration of the blood-brain barrier. 
Such finding, according to clinical data, anamnesis and lab data, seemed to be suggestive of PML-IRIS.
The patient was treated with steroids on(b)(6)  to 
(b) (6)  for IRIS and followed with oral steroid taper.  From (b)(6)  
(b) (6)  to (b) (6)  the clinical condition of the patient was gradually recovering and she started intensive treatment with
FKT (presume physiokinetic therapy). On (b) (6)  the patient was transferred to a rehabilitation facility with 
EDSS of 7.0. Biogen Idec considers this case confirmed for PML on 23 Dec 2014 based on positive CSF for JCV 
(received on 07 Nov 2014), radiologic evidence (received on 10 Dec 2014) and clinical symptoms.
Update 12 Jan 2015: Additional information was received from the neurologist via a MS Standardized PML Data 
Collection Tool. The patient is alive, residing at a rehabilitation facility.  The neurologist assessed the patient s 
current clinical status as follows: the patient is alive, improved from the speech and cognitive point of view, but 
worsened from the motor and sensitive point of view. The data reported in this DCT form are updated at mid- 
December 2014, three months and half after the onset of the symptoms. After, the patient experienced clinical and 
radiological symptoms of MS progression. The neurologist assessed the patient s estimated Karnofsky scores in 
Nov 2009 (prior to starting suspect product), unknown date (on suspect product prior to PML), and 31 Oct 2014 (at 
time of PML diagnosis) as 70 (cares for self; unable to carry on normal activity or to do active work), 80 (normal 
activity with effort; some signs or symptoms of disease), and 20 (very sick; hospital admission necessary; active 
supportive treatment necessary) respectively.  The neurologist assed the patient's EDSS scores on 16 Dec 2009 
(prior to starting suspect product), 27 Aug 2014 (on suspect product prior to PML), and (b) (6)  (at time of PML
diagnosis) as 4.5, 4.5, and 5.0. Test results on 17 Nov 2009, prior to starting suspect product: leukocyte count 
8.34x10(3)/mmc (normal range 4-10), lymphocyte counts 21.6% (normal range 19-48), and absolute lymphocyte 
count 1.8x10(3)/mmc (normal range 1-4). On 24 Nov 2009 a lymphocyte subset analysis showed CD4 714 
cell/microl (41.2%) (normal range 411-1773); CD8 549 cell/microl (31.6%) (normal range 148 - 1326); and 
CD4/CD8 ratio 1.3 (normal range 0.6 - 2.5). On 03 Oct 2012, the patient tested negative for anti-natalizumab 
antibodies. The patient tested positive for serum anti-JCV antibodies on 04 Sep 2013 with index value of 3.570. 
Test results on 20 Aug 2014, on suspect product prior to PML: leukocyte count 9.38x10(3)/mmc, lymphocyte count 
55.2% and absolute lymphocyte Count 5.18x10(3)/mmc. The patient underwent a lumbar puncture on 08 Oct 2014 
with results reported as positive for CSF JCV DNA (b) (6)  at 10 copies per mL on 07 Nov 2014. The patient tested

negative for HIV on (b) (6)  MRIs were performed on (b) (6)  prior to PML diagnosis and on (b) (6)
at the time of PML diagnosis; no results were reported. Test results for(b) (6)  at time of PML: Leukocyte 
Count, Lymphocyte Count, and Absolute Lymphocyte Count were "normal values"; and in (b) (6)  gamma-GT 
310 U/l. The first onset of IRIS symptoms was 08 Oct 2014, determined by clinical symptoms and MRI findings. 
IRIS symptoms included: cognitive / behavior (progressive slowing of attention and concentration, onset 08 Oct 
2014); speech (progressive difficulty to find words during a speech, deficit in writing and reading, onset 08 Oct 
2014); cerebellar (intentional tremor at left upper limb, onset 15 Oct 2014); and seizure multifocal (partial 
epilepticus status with electric focus in left temporal regions, onset (b) (6) ). IRIS treatment medications 
included methylprednisolone 1 g IV two days every 15 days (01 Nov 2014 to 30 Nov 2014) (discrepant dosing 
information from previous report) and prednisone 50 mg PO daily (03 Nov 2014 - ongoing). The patient did not 
receive corticosteroids pre-IRIS onset. The patient has not recovered from PML and as of (b) (6)  has 
recovered from IRIS. Causality for the events of PML and IRIS was assessed as related to TYSABRI.
Update 16 Jan 2015: The treating neurologist spontaneously reported via a Biogen Idec Medical Science Liaison 
(MSL) that the patient's clinical condition is worsening dramatically because of the MS disease as revealed by the 
last MRI (Jan 2015), which showed about 20 small enhancing lesions, suggestive of MS. At the clinical level, the 
patient showed a left hemiplegia. On 29 Dec 2014 the patient started Gilenya (fingolimod) therapy. After consulting 
with another neurologist and on the basis of the radiological and clinical picture of the patient, the intention is to 
start the patient on alemtuzumab therapy as soon as possible.
Update 30 Jan 2015: The neurologist provided additional information via a Biogen Idec representative. The 
neurologist indicated that the patient was improving from a clinical point of view. The hemiparesis, in particular of 
the right arm, was improved and the patient was starting to walk with a support - before just with a wheelchair - due 
to the rehabilitation. The patient is under treatment with cortisone constantly. It was noted that the patient was not 
suitable to receive therapy with alentuzumab due to the high EDSS value and the past event of PML. At the time of 
this report, clinicians were thinking about starting therapy with rituximab (off label use). 
Update 25 Mar 2015: Additional information was received from the neurologist via a MS Standardized PML Data 
Collection Tool. The patient is alive, residing at home, and is currently on prednisone 50 mg daily (started 20 Dec 
2014) for MS therapy due to clinical relapse of MS. The following post-PML labs from 10 Mar 2015 were reported: 
leukocyte count 6.500 (presumed 6,500)/mm3 (normal range 4000-10000/mm3), lymphocyte count 35.8% (normal 
range 19-48%), absolute lymphocyte count 2330/mm3 (normal range 1000-4000/mm3), CD4 count 1057/microliter 
(50%) (normal range 411-1773/microliter), CD8 count 740/microliter (35%) (normal range 148-1326/microliter), 
CD19 count 175/microliter (8.1%) (normal range 23-313/microliter), CD4/CD8 ratio 1.4 (normal range 0.6-2.5), and 
gamma GT 421 U/l (normal range 9-36 U/l). The neurologist reported that the patient was currently undergoing 
treatment with phenytoin "so that [gamma-GT] value has not to be considered pathological." On 06 Feb 2015, the

patient's estimated Karnofsky and EDSS scores were 40 (disabled; requires special care and assistance) and 7.0. 
The most recent brain MRI was performed on 04 Feb 2015 (results not reported). As of 06 Feb 2015, the patient 
had recovered from PML. As of 01 Dec 2014, the patient had partially recovered from IRIS (previously reported as 
recovered). Causality for the events of PML and IRIS was assessed as related to TYSABRI.
Update 10 Apr 2015: A follow-up report received from the Regulatory Authority of Italy - National Pharmacovigilance
Network (NPN) (registry # not provided) reported that the patient's outcome was updated to "condition improving." 
The Regional Centre (Centro Regionale Lombardia) stated that the relationship between the event (presume 
progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy) and TYSABRI, evaluated through the Naranjo algorithm, was 
probable.
Update 09 Jun 2015:  The neurologist spontaneously reported via a medical science liaison (MSL) that the patient 
is currently followed by a different MS center.  The patient has shown clear improvement of speech (speaks slowly 
but recovered almost completely) and of motor ability (she is able to move alone with a double support).  She is 
also able to feed herself with the help of thickeners (due to mild persistent dysphagia).
Update 08 Oct 2015: Additional information was received from the neurologist via a MS Standardized PML Data 
Collection Tool. The patient is alive, residing at home, and is currently on Rituxin (rituximab) since 18 May 2015 for 
clinical relapse and radiological evidence of return of MS. The most recent brain MRI was performed on 25 Sep 
2015; results were not provided. The patient's Karnofsky and EDSS scores was assessed on 06 Oct 2015 to be 50 
(requires considerable assistance and frequent medical care) and 6.5. The outcome of PML was reported as 
unknown (previously reported as recovered). The patient was assessed in (b) (6)  as recovered from IRIS. 
Causality for the events of PML and IRIS was assessed as related to TYSABRI.
Update 08 Oct 2015:  The following additional information was received via the National Pharmacovigilance 
Network (NPN).  An MRI from 25 Sep 2015, compared to MRI from Jul 2015, showed a moderate increase in 
extension of the known areas of signal alteration characterized by hyperintensity in the long TR sequqnces and, 
with the FLAIR, at the peri- and supra-ventricular white matter level, both sub and supra tentorial with a tendency to 
converge, in particular evidence of altered signal areas with pale edges charactierzed by an increased diffusion, 
one (1cm in size) in the white matter at the peri-ventricular right occipital level and one of bigger extension, at the 
peritrigonal side at the level of the uncus of the left parahippocampal gyrus.  No pathological contrast enhancement 
noted.
